<h1>Macintosh Q &amp; A</h1>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I noticed in QuickTime 2.5 that there are new&nbsp;&nbsp;selectors in the Movie Import API<br>

that aren't described in <i>Inside Macintosh: QuickTime Components</i>. Although I found<br>
some information in Technote QT 04, "QuickTime 1.6.1 Features," I haven't been able<br>
to locate any information about the kMovieImportGetFileTypeSelect and<br>
kMovieImportDataRefSelect selectors. Can you tell me something about these?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;The kMovieImportGetFileTypeSelect and kMovieImportDataRefSelect selectors<br>

were added to support some features that were under investigation with the QuickTime<br>
for Netscape plug-in. While these selectors are supported by some of the Apple movie<br>
data import components, they don't provide any new functionality and there's no reason<br>
to consider implementing them in your movie data import component at this time.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>My application plays four QuickTime movies simultaneously from a Director<br>

project. Each of the movies has a single music track with no other video or sound<br>
tracks, and two of the movies use more than one instrument. The Director project<br>
allows the user to control the volume level of each movie independently. The<br>
application works great on the Macintosh with QuickTime 2.1, but under Windows<br>
with QuickTime 2.1.2 only one music track plays at a time. Is it possible to hear all<br>
four music tracks at once under QuickTime for Windows 2.1.2?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;You can do live mixing of your four QuickTime movies only if your Windows<br>

system has four MIDI output devices. Most systems have only one. All Windows<br>
applications suffer from this limitation unless they're clever enough to mix the tracks<br>
on the fly, but none seem to do this.
</p>
<p>
For now, you must pre-mix the four music tracks from the four movies into one<br>
music track in one movie. You won't be able to do live mixing unless you write your<br>
own MIDI sequencer.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Can I play a compressed WAVE file on the Macintosh?</i></p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Yes. You can use the Sound Manager to play a compressed WAVE file on the<br>

Macintosh, but how easy it will be can vary greatly, depending on the type of<br>
compression.
</p>
<p>
If the WAVE file is compressed using ulaw, your program will have to use either<br>
SndPlayDoubleBuffer or SndDoCommand with bufferCmds to play the sound<br>
(QuickTime cannot currently be used). This means that you'll have to parse the WAVE<br>
header yourself and interact with the Sound Manager at a lower level than is possible<br>
by simply calling SndStartFilePlay.
</p>
<p>
Currently, you can't play an IMA-ADPCM compressed WAVE file as easily as a 'ulaw'<br>
compressed WAVE file, because the data stream of a sound compressed with Windows'<br>
IMA-ADPCM compressor differs from the data stream of the same sound compressed<br>
with the Macintosh's IMA compressor. To play an IMA-ADPCM compressed WAVE file<br>
on the Macintosh, your application will first have to decompress chunks of the sound<br>
into memory, then have the Sound Manager play those chunks. You can do this either by<br>
calling SndPlayDoubleBuffer or by using bufferCmds. Of course, if the uncompressed<br>
sound fits completely into memory, you can simply use SndPlay on that one<br>
uncompressed buffer.
</p>
<p>
To play a WAVE file that uses a custom compression algorithm, you can either write<br>
your own 'sdec' (sound decompressor) component or simply have your program<br>
decompress the sound itself. As before, if you can fit the decompressed sound in<br>
memory, you can use any Sound Manager routine to play it. If you can't, you'll have to<br>
decompress it in chunks and use SndPlayDoubleBuffer or a bufferCmd to play each<br>
chunk. If you write your own 'sdec', of course, you can use any Sound Manager routine<br>
that will play an arbitrarily compressed sound, but be sure to indicate that the sound<br>
is compressed with your compressor so that the Sound Manager will know to call your<br>
'sdec'.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>How do I make a sound that will play on both Macintosh and PC computers?</i></p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;This is actually easy, as long as you don't want to play compressed sounds. We<br>

recommend that you use WAVE files for both systems, since they'll play easily on the<br>
Macintosh. (See the previous answer for some tips to help you play WAVE files on the<br>
Macintosh.) Note, however, that there are many other formats that will work,<br>
including AIFF and QuickTime.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>How can I access the "Set Utilities Pattern" pattern? (This pattern, used as a<br>

background by certain system utilities like Find File, is normally set by holding down<br>
the Option key in the Desktop Patterns control panel.)</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;The Desktop Patterns control panel uses resources of type 'ppat' to store both<br>

desktop and utilities patterns. The 'ppat' resource is stored in the System file in your<br>
System Folder; the desktop pattern has an ID of 16 and the utilities pattern has an ID<br>
of 42. Since this isn't documented, it could be subject to change, so you should be<br>
careful when using it.
</p>
<p>
Here's a snippet of code that shows how you can get the utilities pattern and then draw<br>
with it:
</p>
<p>
<code>PixPatHandle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ppatHandle;</code><br>
<code>Rect&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destRect;</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>ppatHandle = (PixPatHandle) GetPixPat(42);</code><br>
<code>if (ppatHandle != NULL) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SetRect(&amp;destRect, 15, 125, 197, 164);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FrameRect(&amp;destRect);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FillCRect(&amp;destRect, ppatHandle);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DisposePixPat(ppatHandle);</code><br>
<code>}</code>
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I discovered that if I hold down the Command key and click in the size box of a<br>

window, I can make the window bigger than the width I pass into GrowWindow. The size<br>
box works as expected when the Command key isn't used. This seems to happen in every<br>
application I've tried. I haven't been able to find any documentation discussing the<br>
relationship between the Command key and the size box. I really need to limit the width<br>
of my windows. Why is this happening and how can I work around it?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Back in the old days when the Macintosh had a 9-inch screen (384 x 542 pixels),<br>

a lot of developers didn't follow Apple's guidelines for window sizes and hard-coded the<br>
sizeRect given to GrowWindow based on this small size.
</p>
<p>
When the Macintosh II was introduced in 1987, Apple engineers felt it would be<br>
frustrating for users not to be able to use the whole area of the new 13-inch monitors.<br>
So Apple implemented the "Command-key grow" feature that you discovered, which<br>
allowed users to get whatever size they wanted. However, this feature was not without<br>
consequence to some applications, whose code couldn't handle larger-than-expected<br>
window sizes. The "Command-key grow" feature is documented on page 209 of the old<br>
<i>Inside Macintosh Volume V</i>, but wasn't documented in the newer <i>Inside Macintosh</i><br>
series.
</p>
<p>
It's trivial to deal with this feature if you really need to limit the window size: simply<br>
check the size returned by GrowWindow, and if it's larger than you allow, reduce it to<br>
your maximum allowed size before calling SizeWindow.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I've noticed that calling DeleteMenuItem mangles the menu data when handling<br>

menu items with strings that have between 251 and 255 characters. Does the Menu<br>
Manager have a problem when handling menu items with strings that long?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Yes, this is a problem, but it hasn't been documented in any Inside Macintosh<br>

books. The Menu Manager assumes that a menu item string isn't longer than 250<br>
characters, so you shouldn't have menu items longer than that.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>When I use ShowDragHilite with a picture filling my window, it highlights only the<br>

areas that are the same as the background of my window. Is there any way to fix this?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Yes. ShowDragHilite isn't very savvy when overlaying image data other than the<br>

background color. The problem lies in QuickDraw's <b>hilite</b> mode. The operation of this<br>
mode is based rather coarsely on the background color. We're working on a fix for this<br>
problem, and eventually hilite mode will work significantly better in all cases,<br>
including that of selecting cells in lists drawn by the standard LDEF. Until then, your<br>
only alternative is to implement your own version of ShowDragHilite.
</p>
<p>
The question then becomes what color to use. Depending on your circumstances, you<br>
may want to use black, white, or perhaps even inversion, although you should try to<br>
avoid inversion against complex images if at all possible, since it can be ugly and<br>
confusing. Should you decide <b>hilite</b> mode is insufficient, it's up to you to decide how<br>
best to draw your highlight.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Sometimes my application's calls to the Drag Manager fail with a -600<br>

(procNotFound) error. This isn't one of the errors listed for these calls. What's up?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;There are three known common causes of this error:<br>
<ul>
<li>    The use of high-level debuggers -- Since the Drag Manager interacts<br>
heavily with the Process Manager, as does the typical high-level debugger,<br>
conflicts inevitably develop. There's no workaround for this problem except to<br>
ask your debugger vendor to improve the debugger's behavior when debugging<br>
Drag Manager code. If your code is encountering such a problem, it should run<br>
fine when the debugger is not involved.</li>
<li>    Passing TrackDrag an event record whose <b>where</b> field is expressed in<br>
local coordinates -- Such <b>where</b> fields often point outside the window in<br>
which the drag originates. (This can also cause a crash, but sometimes simply<br>
results in a -600 error.)</li>
<li>    Attempting to use the Drag Manager with Text Services Manager<br>
windows when the gestaltDragMgrFloatingWind bit isn't defined in the<br>
response to the gestaltDragMgrAttr Gestalt selector -- The value of this bit<br>
denotes whether a Drag Manager bug with TSM windows is fixed on the system<br>
your application is running under.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the last two cases, the Drag Manager has a hard time associating the source window<br>
with a process. Some operations can succeed even without a clear owning process, so<br>
the Drag Manager limps along as well as it can for a while in the hopes that it won't be<br>
asked to do anything that requires a ProcessSerialNumber. When it is asked, the<br>
operation fails.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I've just implemented a DragDrawingProc. To start, I've tried simply to duplicate<br>

the default behavior of the Drag Manager (so that it will look as if I had not in fact<br>
attached a DragDrawingProc). Unfortunately, when the user drags into a valid drop<br>
area and the potential drop receiver calls ShowDragHilite, my DragDrawingProc<br>
seems to be responsible for leaving a trail of pixels on the screen. What am I doing<br>
wrong?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;This happens because the Drag Manager doesn't always pass the entire "old" or<br>

"new" region to the DragDrawingProc. Below is a function that mimics what the Drag<br>
Manager does when you don't attach a DragDrawingProc to a DragReference before<br>
calling TrackDrag:
</p>
<p>
<code>static pascal OSErr LikeDefaultDragDrawingProc(</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DragRegionMessage message, RgnHandle showRegion, Point showOrigin,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RgnHandle hideRegion, Point hideOrigin, void *dragDrawingRefCon,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DragReference theDragRef)</code><br>
<code>{</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSErr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;err = noErr;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RgnHandle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xorMe;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oldA5;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattern&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gray;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;switch (message) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case dragRegionBegin:</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oldA5 = SetA5((long) dragDrawingRefCon);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gray = qd.gray;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SetA5(oldA5);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PenPat(&amp;gray);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PenMode(notPatXor);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case dragRegionDraw:</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xorMe = NewRgn();</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (!(err = MemError())) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XorRgn(showRegion, hideRegion, xorMe);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PaintRgn(xorMe);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case dragRegionHide:</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PaintRgn(hideRegion);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return err;</code><br>
<code>}</code>
</p>
<p>
The call to XorRgn is the key. It's also very important to pass the correct value for the<br>
dragDrawingRefCon to SetDragDrawingProc:
</p>
<p>
<code>SetDragDrawingProc(dragRef, LikeDefaultDragDrawingProc,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(void*)SetCurrentA5());</code>
</p>
<p>
Note that the above works for 680x0 code; UniversalProcPtr creation has been<br>
omitted for simplicity.
</p>
<p>
By the way, be careful not to mix the use of SetDragDrawingProc and SetDragImage.<br>
See Technote 1043, "On Drag Manager Additions," for details.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>When my application calls the Drag Manager's TrackDrag routine and the user<br>

drags text out of my application onto the desktop, a clipping file appears. At least it<br>
does under System 7.5; under System 7.1, nothing happens. Why?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;In Systems 7.1 through 7.1.2, the Drag Manager is implemented by means of<br>

multiple extensions (all in the Extensions folder), and various capabilities become<br>
available according to which extensions are installed. You can't count on any of these<br>
extensions being installed, so if you want your application to use the full functionality<br>
of the Drag Manager under these system versions, your application's installer should<br>
install these extensions.
</p>
<p>
Some systems may already have older versions of Drag Manager components, in which<br>
case you may want to replace them with newer versions. If you do, be sure to install<br>
all of the appropriate files to ensure version parity on the user's system.
</p>
<p>
Table 1 describes which components implement which functionality on which system.<br>
It's provided only for purposes of installation. Your application should not attempt to<br>
determine what functionality is available according to which files are installed (since<br>
users may have enabled some extensions without restarting, and since different<br>
versions of the system require different sets of extensions). Your application should<br>
instead test for Drag Manager functionality with the gestaltDragMgrAttr Gestalt<br>
selector.

</p>
<p>
In System 7 and 7.0.1, the Drag Manager is supported, but only for intra-application<br>
dragging. This makes it less desirable to install the required Macintosh Drag and Drop<br>
extension, because it provides nothing that can't be implemented through judicious use<br>
of QuickDraw, the Window Manager, and OSEventAvail.
</p>
<p>
In System 7.5, the picture is equally simple but significantly richer. All Drag<br>
Manager functionality is built into or installed with the system.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Under MacTCP and Open Transport 1.0.x, if I'm using a Hosts file and I call<br>

AddrToName, the name resolves to the correct address. Under Open Transport 1.1 it<br>
returns an authNameErr. What's going on?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Open Transport version 1.0.8 mapped name-to-address and address-to-name<br>

translations into the same cache, and searched the cache whenever either a<br>
name-to-address or an address-to-name mapping was requested. Sounds good, right?<br>
The problem is, it broke several server load-sharing implementations that registered<br>
a service name as a single alias for a list of CNAMEs, each of which pointed to a server<br>
running the service. Under the former caching scheme, load-sharing techniques that<br>
depended on reverse lookups didn't work for the Macintosh -- they'd always wind up<br>
with the same host name and hardware address for the original alias.</i>
</p>
<p>
As a result, Open Transport 1.1 no longer caches address-to-name mappings (PTR<br>
records), nor does it search the name-to-address cache for address-to-name requests.<br>
(The treatment of CNAME records received was also modified, but that's irrelevant to<br>
your question.) Instead, it queries the configured domain name servers; apparently<br>
you got no authoritative information from any of them (or perhaps you weren't using<br>
them at all).
</p>
<p>
Strictly speaking, the behavior you're now seeing is more correct than what you saw<br>
before. DNS A resource records map names to addresses. To map an address to a name,<br>
you need a PTR record. The previous behavior of the MacTCP and Open Transport<br>
TCP/IP DNRs, treating the one as the mirror image of the other, was incorrect and has<br>
been changed accordingly.
</p>
<p>
The Macintosh Hosts file historically did not support PTR records, and does not<br>
support PTR records now. To do so, those records would have to be cached, once again<br>
breaking the load-sharing schemes. The only resource records the Hosts file supports<br>
are: A (name to address), CNAME (alias to fully qualified domain name), and NS<br>
(domain name server's fully qualified domain name). If you need a PTR mapping, you<br>
must register it with your local domain name server administrator, or maintain it<br>
within your own code from the results of your earlier name-to-address request.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'm writing an application using the native Open Transport APIs. My original<br>

intention was to ship only a 680x0 version of the application, but I've heard that this<br>
won't be compatible with future versions of Open Transport. Is this true?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Yes. We strongly recommend that you ship all native Open Transport applications<br>

as fat applications for maximum speed and compatibility.
</p>
<p>
Under System 7, Open Transport provides native APIs for both 680x0 and PowerPC<br>
clients. This allows 680x0 Open Transport clients to operate under emulation on a<br>
Power Macintosh. This won't be supported under future systems because they won't<br>
support the Apple Shared Library Manager, the dynamic linking technology used by<br>
680x0 Open Transport clients. Table 2 summarizes this information.

</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>What are the different Gestalt selectors for MacTCP, Open Transport, and<br>

AppleTalk?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;The Gestalt selector for MacTCP is 'mtcp'. MacTCP versions 1.0 through 1.0.3<br>

didn't register this selector. Versions 1.1, 1.1.1., and 2.0 return 1, 2, and 3,<br>
respectively. If Open Transport is installed, 4 is returned. A value of 0 is returned if<br>
the driver is not opened.
</p>
<p>
The Gestalt selectors for Open Transport are gestaltOpenTpt and<br>
gestaltOpenTptVersions. You can test whether Open Transport and its various parts are<br>
available by calling the Gestalt function with the gestaltOpenTpt selector. The bits<br>
currently used are defined by constants in OpenTransport.h, as follows:
</p>
<p>
<code>enum {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gestaltOpenTpt = 'otan',</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gestaltOpenTptPresent = 0x00000001,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gestaltOpenTptLoaded = 0x00000002,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gestaltOpenTptAppleTalkPresent = 0x00000004,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gestaltOpenTptAppleTalkLoaded = 0x00000008,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gestaltOpenTptTCPPresent = 0x00000010,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gestaltOpenTptTCPLoaded = 0x00000020,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gestaltOpenTptNetwarePresent = 0x00000040,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gestaltOpenTptNetwareLoaded = 0x00000080</code><br>
<code>};</code>
</p>
<p>
If Gestalt returns no error and responds with a nonzero value, Open Transport is<br>
available. To find out whether Open Transport AppleTalk, TCP, or NetWare is present,<br>
you can examine the response parameter bits as shown above. For example, if you pass<br>
the gestaltOpenTpt selector to Gestalt, a result of 0x0000001F means that Open<br>
Transport is present and loaded, the AppleTalk protocol stack is also present and<br>
loaded, and the TCP protocol stack is present but <i>not</i> loaded.
</p>
<p>
The gestaltOpenTptVersions selector is used to determine the Open Transport version<br>
in NumVersion format. For example, passing the gestaltOpenTptVersions selector<br>
through a Gestalt call or MacsBug to Open Transport version 1.1.1b9 yields a result of<br>
0x01116009. (Note that Open Transport versions 1.0 through 1.0.8 did not register<br>
this selector.) For more information on Apple's version-numbering scheme and the<br>
NumVersion format, see Technote OV 12, "Version Territory."
</p>
<p>
For AppleTalk, the Gestalt selectors are 'atkv' (no constant defined) and<br>
gestaltAppleTalkVersion. The gestaltAppleTalkVersion selector was introduced in<br>
AppleTalk version 54 to provide basic version information. Calling Gestalt with this<br>
selector provides the major revision version in the low-order byte of the function<br>
result. For example, passing the gestaltAppleTalkVersion selector in a Gestalt call or<br>
through MacsBug with a result of 0x0000003C means that AppleTalk version 60 is<br>
present. (Note that the gestaltAppleTalkVersion selector is not available when<br>
AppleTalk is turned off in the Chooser.)
</p>
<p>
The 'atkv' Gestalt selector was introduced as an alternative in AppleTalk version 56 to<br>
provide more complete version information via the 'vers' resource. For example,<br>
passing the 'atkv' selector to AppleTalk version 60 through a Gestalt call or MacsBug<br>
yields 0x3C108000.

<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'm writing an Open Transport module that conforms to the Transport Provider<br>

Interface (TPI). I find that Open Transport passes data to my TPI module using<br>
M_DATA message blocks, rather than M_PROTO message blocks with PRIM_type being<br>
T_DATA_REQ. What's going on?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;The answer can be found at the end of the description of T_DATA_REQ in Appendix<br>

A-2 of <i>STREAMS Modules and Drivers</i> (UNIX Press, 1992):
</p>
<p>
The transport provider must also recognize a message of one or more M_DATA<br>
message blocks without the leading M_PROTO message block as a T_DATA_REQ<br>
primitive. This message type will be initiated from the write (BA_OS)<br>
operating system service routine.
</p>
<p>
Open Transport deliberately uses this variant behavior as an optimization. By using<br>
M_DATA, it avoids allocating a buffer for the M_PROTO header. Since every memory<br>
allocation takes time, avoiding this one makes the system faster.
</p>
<p>
This behavior isn't seen on expedited data because the specification doesn't allow for<br>
this optimization on T_EXDATA_REQ.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>How can I launch a "foreground" task to run in the background?</i></p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;You should use the LaunchApplication call in the Process Manager with the<br>

launchDontSwitch flag set in the launchControlFlags field. For more information about<br>
LaunchApplication, see <i>Inside Macintosh: Processes</i>, Chapter 2.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Tackling a difficult problem in my application had put me in a foul mood, when a<br>

colleague pointed out that I was being awfully "tetchy." I told him the correct word is<br>
"touchy," and sure enough my spelling checker doesn't recognize "tetchy." Who's<br>
right?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Your colleague wins this one. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> does recognize<br>

"tetchy," which means "easily irritated or made angry." It lists many variants for the<br>
spelling of this word, including techy, techie, teachy, teechy, tetchie, tecchy, titchie,<br>
tichy, titchy, tertchy, tatchy, and tachy.
