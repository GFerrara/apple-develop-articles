<h1>Making the Most of Memory in OpenDoc</h1>
<h2>Troy Gaul and Vincent Lo</h2>

</p>
<p>
In Issue 28, we discussed how the OpenDoc Memory Manager works and how part<br>
editors manage Toolbox memory. This time we'll examine ways to use memory more<br>
efficiently in the OpenDoc environment. 
</p>
<p>
We'll begin by talking about how to avoid memory leaks. Memory leaks, which can be a<br>
problem when developing traditional Macintosh applications, are as much a concern in<br>
OpenDoc. But because OpenDoc uses reference counting, there are a few extra things to<br>
pay attention to. We'll also discuss how to handle parameters correctly to avoid<br>
memory leaks, and we'll take a look at ways you can set up your part editor to<br>
maximize memory usage.
</p>
<h2>AVOIDING MEMORY LEAKS</h2>
<p>
OpenDoc objects and part editors use a reference-counting scheme that enables<br>
OpenDoc to keep track of which objects are in use. Each time a client acquires an object<br>
(through the object's Acquire method), the object's reference count is incremented by<br>
1. When the object is no longer being used, the client releases it (by calling the<br>
object's Release method) and its reference count is decremented. The object's<br>
reference count indicates how many references to the object are being held by clients.<br>
When the reference count goes down to 0, the object can be destroyed without affecting<br>
any other objects. For more information on how reference counting works in OpenDoc,<br>
see the OpenDoc Road column in <i>develop</i> Issue 27, "Facilitating Part Editor Unloading."
</p>
<p>
If the acquired object doesn't get released when it should, the reference count doesn't go<br>
to 0 and the object remains in memory until the session ends. As a result, a memory<br>
leak occurs because the occupied memory can't be used during the session.
</p>
<p>
To avoid reference count errors, it helps to keep in mind which classes are<br>
reference-counted and which methods affect an object's reference count. OpenDoc uses<br>
reference counting on classes whose objects often have more than one client. These<br>
classes are subclasses of ODRefCntObject, and many are classes that part editors<br>
interact with directly.
</p>
<p>
In general, if a method name starts with "Acquire," the reference count of the object<br>
named in the method is incremented when the method is called. When the object is no<br>
longer needed, the caller should release it. For example, if a part editor calls<br>
ODDraft::AcquireFrame to access a frame object, the reference count of the returned<br>
frame object is incremented. After the editor is done using the frame reference, a call<br>
to the object's Release method (ODFrame::Release) must be made to avoid a memory<br>
leak.
</p>
<p>
Some methods return a reference-counted object without affecting the object's<br>
reference count. These methods usually start with "Get." For example,<br>
ODFacet::GetFrame returns the frame object with which the facet is associated without<br>
incrementing the reference count of the frame object. In this case, the caller shouldn't<br>
call ODFrame::Release. Typically, a Get method is used to return an invariant or<br>
unchanged attribute of an object. In the case of ODFacet, the facet acquires and stores a<br>
reference to its ODFrame object. This reference isn't released until the ODFacet object<br>
is deleted. When ODFacet::GetFrame is called, ODFacet returns the stored reference to<br>
the caller. Since this reference remains valid until the ODFacet is deleted, you can use<br>
it as long as the ODFacet is a valid object. If you want to use the returned ODFrame<br>
object beyond the ODFacet's lifetime, you should call Acquire on the ODFrame to ensure<br>
that you have a valid reference to it.
</p>
<p>
The best way to avoid reference count errors is to familiarize yourself with the<br>
OpenDoc API and understand how it affects an object's reference count. The<i>OpenDoc</i><br>
<i>Class Reference</i> provides a detailed description of reference counting for each method.
</p>
<p>
<b>Temporary objects to the rescue.</b> The code for acquiring a reference-counted<br>
object for a brief period of time and then releasing it turns out to be quite complicated.<br>
Listing 1 shows how complicated it can be to handle a reference-counted object when<br>
using exception-handling code.
</p>

<p>
______________________________
</p>
<p>
To help alleviate this problem, OpenDoc provides a utility library that uses<br>
stack-based C++ objects to wrap references to OpenDoc reference-counted objects.<br>
These C++ objects are called <i>temporary objects</i>. Whenever such a C++ object goes out<br>
of scope, its destructor is called and releases the reference-counted object.
</p>
<p>
The code fragment shown in Listing 2 does the same thing as the example in Listing 1<br>
but uses temporary objects instead. This code is simpler and less error-prone.

<p>
The OpenDoc utility library provides temporary objects for 17 reference-counted<br>
classes, including ODPart, ODFrame, ODExtension, and ODStorageUnit. For more<br>
information on creating temporary objects, see the "Temporary Objects" section of<br>
Appendix A in the <i>OpenDoc Cookbook</i>.
</p>
<p>
The OpenDoc utility library also provides temporary objects for objects that aren't<br>
reference-counted, such as ODByteArray and ODIText. These OpenDoc types deserve<br>
special attention in regard to memory usage.
</p>
<p>
The ODByteArray structure contains three fields: <b>_buffer</b>, <b>_maximum</b>,<br>
and<b>_length</b>. The <b>_buffer</b> field points to a memory block whose size is indicated by<br>
the <b>_maximum</b> field. <b>_length</b> is the number of bytes used; it has to be less than or<br>
equal to the value of <b>_maximum</b>.
</p>
<p>
Generally, ODByteArray is used instead of a raw pointer because the size of the<br>
memory block is included. This enables SOM and OpenDoc to pass data between<br>
processes without relying on shared memory. But because the _buffer field is hidden<br>
in the ODByteArray, the memory block can easily be forgotten. Failing to free this<br>
memory block when an ODByteArray is deallocated creates a memory leak.
</p>
<p>
The ODIText structure stores a user-visible string. One of its fields contains the<br>
string's format; the other is an ODByteArray that contains the text string. The memory<br>
block in the ODByteArray needs to be freed when the ODIText structure is deallocated.
</p>
<p>
<b>Handling in and out parameters.</b> Memory leaks can also occur when parameters<br>
aren't handled correctly. In an OpenDoc method, each parameter is designated as<br>
<b>in</b>,<b>out</b>, or <b>inout</b>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>An <b>in</b> parameter passes data from the caller to the callee.</li>
<li>An <b>out</b> parameter transfers data from the callee to the caller. A method's<br>
result also acts as an out parameter.</li>
<li>An <b>inout</b> parameter passes data from the caller to the callee, which can<br>
then modify it and pass it back.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To determine a particular parameter's designation, you can check the ".idl" files, or<br>
see the <i>OpenDoc Class Reference</i>for detailed information on each parameter.
</p>
<p>
The parameter's designation defines the memory responsibility of the caller and callee.<br>
The part editor can use memory on the stack for parameters of primitive types or<br>
fixed-size data structures. But for strings, byte array buffers, and objects, the part<br>
editor must use the OpenDoc Memory Manager to do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>allocate and deallocate memory for <b>in</b> and <b>inout</b> parameters passed to an<br>
OpenDoc object</li>
<li>deallocate memory for <b>out</b> parameters returned from an OpenDoc object</li>
<li>allocate memory for <b>out</b> parameters returned from the part editor's<br>
methods</li>
</ul>
<p>
If a part editor calls an OpenDoc method and doesn't deallocate the<b>out</b> parameter, the<br>
memory won't be freed until the session ends, causing a memory leak.
</p>
<p>
Since it's impossible to know how a piece of memory is allocated, OpenDoc and part<br>
editors have to use the OpenDoc Memory Manager as the common memory management<br>
facility. This is the only way to ensure that memory allocated by OpenDoc can be freed<br>
by the part editor and vice versa.
</p>
<h2>SETTING UP YOUR PART EDITOR</h2>
<p>
Because your part editor is used in documents with other part editors as users<br>
construct compound documents, it's important to make the best use of memory. Let's<br>
talk about some of the things you can do to minimize memory usage.
</p>
<p>
<b>Keep the data section small.</b> When creating a part (which is a shared library),<br>
the linker will generate code and data sections. The code section contains the<br>
instructions that make up your part editor. This section is read-only because it's<br>
file-mapped onto read-only memory when virtual memory is in use. The data section<br>
is stored separately because it needs to be writeable; it contains globals, static<br>
variables, transition vectors, virtual tables, and so on.
</p>
<p>
A single in-memory or memory-mapped copy of the code section is shared by all<br>
processes in which that code is used. The data section is handled differently: Each<br>
process instantiates a copy of the data section, making globals per-process rather than<br>
per-computer or per-part. Also, because there is normally one process per OpenDoc<br>
document, a separate data section usually exists for each document that contains a part<br>
bound to your editor. Therefore, you should control the size of your data section so that<br>
copies of it don't take up too much memory when multiple documents are open.
</p>
<p>
Here's what you can do to keep the size of your data section down:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit your use of global variables -- Since globals are stored in the data<br>
section, use them only for those things that must be per-process globals.</li>
<li>Use read-only string constants -- String constants that are writeable<br>
must be located in your data section because the compiler assumes that you<br>
might write into the memory associated with them. If you have the compiler<br>
make your string constants read-only (by checking the Make Strings ReadOnly<br>
box in the PPC Processor panel in CodeWarrior, for example), these strings<br>
can be put into the code section instead of the data section. But remember that<br>
after doing this, you should not write to these string constants. You can still<br>
allocate memory in the OpenDoc heap for strings and write to them. You can<br>
also put string buffers, such as Str255 strings, on the stack in your code and<br>
write to them there. Note that any user-visible string constants should be<br>
stored in resources so that your editor can be localized.</li>
<li>Avoid virtual functions -- Space is made for virtual functions of C++<br>
classes in the data section because the virtual tables must be written once (for<br>
each process) to point to the functions residing in the read-only code section.<br>
You can make the virtual table smaller by not making functions virtual. It's<br>
best to design your classes with as few virtual functions as possible, adding<br>
more only as the need arises.</li>
<li>Reduce the number of transition vectors -- For each import and export<br>
symbol in a library, there's a TVector, or transition vector. (CFM-68K calls<br>
them XVectors.) The TVector must be writeable because, like a virtual table,<br>
it has to be written once to point to the corresponding memory address when<br>
the code is loaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Reduce exports.</b> By minimizing the number of symbols that are exported, you can<br>
save memory. Symbol name strings are stored in the PEF (Preferred Executable<br>
Format) container of your code fragment. If you're using a shared library that<br>
contains a framework or set of C++ classes, you usually need to export the symbols<br>
for each of the member functions in the shared library and import the relevant ones<br>
into your part editor to call them or subclass them. C++ functions have long symbol<br>
names because they include type signature information. As a result, the size of your<br>
code fragment can increase significantly.
</p>
<p>
This is particularly noticeable if you have multiple part editors that reference the<br>
same code, since they'll all have large tables of symbol names. You can use a tool like<br>
DumpPEF to check what type of information your code fragment contains and how much<br>
space it's taking up.
</p>
<p>
A workaround is to statically link classes to your part editor. This means fewer<br>
imports and less memory used. Of course, if you do this, you lose some of the<br>
advantages of sharing code via a shared library.
</p>
<p>
<b>Package multiple part editors intelligently.</b> If you're writing a suite of part<br>
editors for end users, it's a good idea to package them as separate editor files in the<br>
Editors folder. However, as mentioned earlier, if you want to share common code, the<br>
amount of memory that's used by all the editors combined can be substantial.
</p>
<p>
Packaging all your part editors and the common code in a single code fragment reduces<br>
the number of imports and exports to almost nothing. But then you can't update just<br>
one of the editors in your suite -- you have to replace the entire shared library. It's<br>
also detrimental if only one or two of your editors are being used, because the system<br>
loads the entire code fragment but only a portion of it is being referenced. This isn't as<br>
much of a problem if the user has virtual memory enabled, but without it, memory is<br>
wasted.
</p>
<p>
To combine multiple OpenDoc part editors into one code fragment, you have to compile<br>
the code for all of them together. You can do this either by putting them all into one<br>
project or by having multiple projects generate static library files and a master<br>
project that includes each of the single-part libraries. Then you need to make sure<br>
that the ClassData symbols for all the parts are exported as separate symbols, by using<br>
pragmas or a ".exp" file. Finally, you must include the 'nmap' resources from all the<br>
individual editors in the combined file. Of course, the IDs of these resources can't<br>
conflict, but since OpenDoc doesn't require any specific resource IDs for 'nmap'<br>
resources, that shouldn't be a problem to set up.
</p>
<p>
<b>Use SOM classes instead of C++.</b> If you'd like to separate framework code from<br>
part editor code (for example, to have multiple editors share the same framework or<br>
set of classes), note that there are several advantages to using SOM classes instead of<br>
C++ classes.
</p>
<p>
With SOM on the Mac OS, you only have to export the class's ClassData symbol. The<br>
virtual tables are maintained by the SOM kernel; they don't exist in your data section.
</p>
<p>
Since SOM has so little overhead, you can package multiple editors as separate code<br>
fragments (either in separate, replaceable files or in a single file). Editors that aren't<br>
being used won't be loaded.
</p>
<p>
You can also reduce the granularity of your shared libraries, such that different<br>
classes are in different shared libraries (again, in separate files or the same file).<br>
This allows you to split up your framework so that only the sections that the client<br>
needs are loaded into memory. For example, if you have one part editor that embeds<br>
other editors and another that doesn't, but they share the same framework, the<br>
framework's embedding code can be in a separate shared library from the code that's<br>
needed by all part editors.
</p>
<p>
SOM supports release-to-release binary compatibility, and it deals with the fragile<br>
base class problem of C++. It also defines a binary interface that supports languages<br>
other than C++. Currently, emitters on the Mac OS for C and C++ are available. Other<br>
languages can also be supported.
</p>
<p>
Don't be afraid to use SOM. Better tools for building SOM classes are being released. In<br>
particular, Direct-to-SOM support has been added to Metrowerks CodeWarrior's C++<br>
compiler and Apple's MrCpp, so you can build SOM classes with much less effort and<br>
with a more familiar syntax.
</p>
<p>
<b>Use #pragma internal.</b> Space is also wasted when it's set aside for instructions and<br>
never used. By default, functions on a PowerPC(TM) processor are assumed to be<br>
external, so for the processor to jump to the routine, it's expected to go through a<br>
TVector. To do this, the compiler leaves room in the code for the linker to add the<br>
necessary instruction to restore the TOC (Table Of Contents) after a jump to a TVector.<br>
If it turns out that the routine is in the same code fragment, restoring the TOC isn't<br>
necessary, but because the space has already been inserted, the linker has little<br>
recourse but to put a no-op instruction in that place. (The code was generated<br>
expecting certain offsets, so the linker can't shuffle the code around easily.) Space is<br>
then wasted for calls that are internal to the code fragment.
</p>
<p>
There are a couple of ways around this. One thing you can do is to declare a function<br>
with the keyword <b>static</b> (this means that it can't be used outside the file it's defined<br>
in) so that the compiler can tell it's an internal function. You can also use the<br>
<b>internal</b> pragma in CodeWarrior. The following code marks the declaration of two<br>
functions as internal by enclosing them in a <b>#pragma internal</b> block. This informs<br>
the compiler that calls to those functions can be assumed to be internal calls, and it<br>
won't leave space for restoring the TOC after a TVector call.
</p>
<p>
<code>#pragma internal on</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void InternalFunction();</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ODBoolean AnotherInternalFunction(short count);</code><br>
<code>#pragma internal reset</code>
</p>
<p>
Note that a function internal to your code can still be an export from your shared<br>
library. In this case, your header should conditionalize its inclusion of<b>#pragma</b><br>
<b>internal</b> for your own use so that external clients don't mistakenly see it as internal.
</p>
<p>
<b>This technique is not used for CFM-68K code</b> because calls there are<br>
assumed to be internal unless they're marked otherwise (with <b>#pragma</b><br>
<b>import</b>).*
</p>
<p>
The MrPlus profiling tool can also be used to get rid of unneeded no-op instructions.<br>
You can get this tool and its documentation on the E.T.O. and MPW Pro CDs.
</p>
<h2>EVERY BYTE COUNTS</h2>
<p>
OpenDoc presents a new model for constructing software. However, many of the<br>
techniques you've used for the traditional application model can still be applied to the<br>
OpenDoc environment. By also incorporating some of the suggestions we've brought up<br>
here, you'll be able to further reduce your part editor's footprint and avoid memory<br>
leaks.
