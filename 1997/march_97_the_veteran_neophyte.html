We at Delta Tao Software (creators of Spaceward Ho!, Strategic Conquest, and Eric's<br>
Ultimate Solitaire) have been working on Clan Lord, a network game that may someday<br>
have thousands of players exploring and colonizing an electronic landscape. We want a<br>
harmonious online world that's enjoyable for every player, and we've come up with a<br>
system that encourages this, without authoritarian overtones -- or at least we hope it<br>
will. This column looks over some of our system's mechanics, repercussions, and<br>
possible applications beyond gaming, and gives some food for thought for your own<br>
projects.
</p>

<h2>HOW CLAN LORD USES KARMA</h2>
<p>
Clan Lord is a big Mac network game. (No, not a Big Mac network game; we'd hate<br>
getting sued by McDonald's!) Network games are nothing new to us, but now, with the<br>
massive proliferation of the Internet, we want to do a truly epic game. Clan Lord<br>
doesn't fall under the traditional definition of a game: there's no end, and there are no<br>
winners and losers. It's more like a complete world, and each player is a member of an<br>
online society. Online societies naturally develop their own customs, ethics, and<br>
morals, just as other groups do. Our goal is to have the world be enjoyable -- a<br>
pleasant place to meet and interact.
</p>
<p>
The key to a good party is inviting the right people. Some people enhance their<br>
environment. In an online world, they answer questions, help people, and encourage<br>
others to exhibit proper behavior. We'll call these people "good."
</p>
<p>
Some people do their best to ruin the party for everyone. In an online world, they<br>
ridicule, shout, and abuse. They're often found saying things like "Bob Dole is a<br>
lemonhead!" and "HOWARD STURN RULEZ!" We'll call these people "bad."
</p>
<p>
On a service like America Online, the worst people are eventually ejected. But good<br>
people generally receive only personal satisfaction from their sometimes considerable<br>
efforts. That the Internet information-sharing exchange works so well is a marvel that<br>
speaks well of (oft-ridiculed) human nature, but it could work even better. Our goal<br>
is to increase the ratio of good people to bad and the likelihood of good behavior.
</p>
<p>
Without external controls, games like this (usually called MUDs, for Multi-User<br>
Dungeons) tend to devolve into hack-and-slash slugfests. New players join in, only to<br>
find themselves repeatedly killed by more experienced players. Discouraged and<br>
humiliated, they abandon the game. This problem is usually "fixed" by rule changes<br>
that make it impossible to attack newer players, or by threats from the game<br>
developers to eject (bad) people who hunt other players. These solutions often cause as<br>
many problems as they solve. Established games are most successful when there's a<br>
core of (good) veterans who encourage and protect the "newbies."
</p>
<p>
So we want lots of good people, and not too many bad ones -- but how do you tell one<br>
from the other? A host could moderate, flagging people one way or the other. But this<br>
is subjective, and it reeks of authoritarianism. It's also too much like work. We came<br>
up with a painless, automatic solution for our game: digital karma.
</p>
<p>
For every day you spend in Clan Lord, you can give 100 karma points to other players,<br>
as either good karma or bad karma. If someone solves a problem for you, or says<br>
something you agree with, or even gives a friendly word to a stranger, you can send<br>
them some good karma. If someone insults, curses, lies, or bugs you in any way, you<br>
can send them some bad karma. You can't give karma to yourself, and you can't change<br>
(or respend) the karma other people give you.
</p>
<p>
Over time, this karma adds up to a number telling how "good" a person is. People with<br>
good karma earned it with good words and deeds, and people with bad karma earned it<br>
by being annoying and antisocial. In Clan Lord, some places are accessible only to<br>
people with good karma, while people with bad karma may have to fight their way out<br>
of "Hell" when they die. Organizations of players (called clans, of course) also have<br>
karma ratings, just by summing the karma of their members.
</p>

<h2>BUT DOES IT WORK?</h2>
<p>
There's never been a digital karma system, so we spent a lot of time worrying that it<br>
might cause as many or more problems than it solves. What if bad people abuse the<br>
system to make themselves appear good? What if good people go unrewarded, become<br>
disillusioned, and go bad or -- worse -- quit altogether? It might be that, since the<br>
total sum of karma is large, individual abuses would get averaged out. Since each<br>
person gets 100 karma points to distribute per day, thousands of people means<br>
hundreds of thousands of karma points moving around. However, since the average<br>
karma received by each person is 100 a day, an individual can concentrate his or her<br>
karma to have a substantial influence on specific other individuals.
</p>
<p>
For example, Ma and Pa Barker spend a day tormenting Elvis. (See Figure 1.) Elvis<br>
gives each of them 50 bad karma. But Ma gives Pa 80 good karma for holding Elvis<br>
down while she kicks him. And Pa gives Ma 80 good karma for doing such a good job<br>
tying Elvis's hands to his ankles. And they each give Elvis 20 bad karma for whining so<br>
much. When lovely Rita (Meter Maid) comes by, she might cart Elvis (with 40 bad<br>
karma) off to jail for tormenting the obviously virtuous Barkers (with 30 good karma<br>
each). "You must have really made them angry," she murmurs as she slips on the<br>
handcuffs.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1.</b> Karma distribution
</p>
<p>
This sort of thing is certain to happen, but it's likely that in the long run the Barkers'<br>
evil ways will catch up with them. Elvis can relate the tale to his friends George, John,<br>
Paul, and Ringo, who together can inflict more bad karma on those nasty Barkers than<br>
they know what to do with. What's more, the Barkers have gone on to annoy yet another<br>
innocent bandsman who can inflict some bad karma of his own. In the long run, the<br>
Barkers have to spend as much time pleasing people (even each other) as hurting them<br>
to keep their karma in the black.
</p>
<p>
What about the problem of do-gooders not getting rewarded? Johnny B. wanders in to<br>
find helpless Elvis, tied up and bruised from his run-in with the Barkers. He cuts<br>
away the bonds, applies first aid, and gives Elvis some spending money. Elvis, instead<br>
of bestowing good karma on Johnny B., inflicts bad karma on the Barkers. Johnny B.<br>
finds himself with no better karma, despite his afternoon of good deeds. Maybe next<br>
time he'll be less inclined to help the helpless.
</p>
<p>
But probably not. He still gets all the intangible karma he would have gotten before our<br>
system was in place. Elvis is still grateful. Johnny B. will, over time, get plenty of<br>
good karma for his benevolent activities. In addition to getting the unquantifiable<br>
benefits that come with doing a good turn daily, he'll get an occasional reward of good<br>
karma. He'll probably be even more likely to do good deeds than he was before.
</p>
<p>
Now, the worst case. Ozzy, after watching Natural Born Killers, decides it would be fun<br>
to see just how much bad karma he can rack up. He traipses through the countryside<br>
setting fire to outhouses, pushing grandmothers down stairs, and biting the heads off of<br>
innocent rodents. He's bad to the bone. He racks so much bad karma that he grows horns<br>
and hooves. But he doesn't care -- he's going for the record. The baddest cat ever, and<br>
our little system gives him the numbers to prove it. Aren't we just egging him on?
</p>
<p>
There are always going to be a select few who delight in infamy. Perhaps a few of those<br>
could be persuaded to form vigilante groups, hunting the Most Wanted of the Bad Karma<br>
Boys. Just as many folks are going to go for the evil-punishing record as for the bad<br>
karma record. We'd turn those of Ozzy's frame of mind against each other. His worst<br>
enemy is his own kind.
</p>

<h2>WHERE DOES IT GO FROM THERE?</h2>
<p>
Besides modifying behavior, karma studies can identify trends, and possibly give<br>
warnings of societal problems. The ratio of good karma to bad karma is an indicator of<br>
how happy the society is as a whole. A sudden drop in that ratio could be an early<br>
symptom that something is wrong, giving us a chance to nip the problem in the bud. If<br>
we do our job, that ratio should see a gradual increase over time, as we weed out things<br>
that make people unhappy.
</p>
<p>
We'll no doubt also see some interesting statistics. I'm curious to see whether people<br>
who send lots of bad karma are the same people who receive it, and vice versa. I've<br>
certainly always suspected that that's how it works in life. Any complex economic<br>
system, like our described karma system, is largely unpredictable. Who's to say what<br>
kind of karma wars might erupt? A system like this will have consequences nobody<br>
anticipates. It's fun to do thought experiments, as we've done here, but the fact is we<br>
won't really know until afterward.
</p>
<p>
And there are lots of questions for which we hesitate to guess the answers: Is it better<br>
to give karma feedback to recipients immediately, so as to help them modify their<br>
actions appropriately? Or is it smarter to delay this information and make it<br>
anonymous, so that repercussions and threats won't influence its delivery? Who<br>
knows? These questions aren't likely to be answered without lots of testing and<br>
experimentation, but once that's done, we're likely to have a more pleasant and<br>
predictable online society.
</p>
<p>
We've been talking about digital karma in terms of our game, but that doesn't need to<br>
be where it ends. Newsgroups and bulletin boards would certainly benefit by having<br>
more good people and fewer bad. You could screen out bad-karma messages or the<br>
people that post them. And people who post would get measurable feedback on how<br>
helpful their posts are, without having to sift through a lot of noise.
</p>

<h2>INSTANT KARMA'S GONNA GET YOU</h2>
<p>
Predicting how computers will be used has never been easy. In the fifties, people<br>
thought computers would eventually calculate missile trajectories and save the world<br>
from the evil communists. In the seventies, the advent of the personal computer led<br>
Marketing people to reveal the true possibilities: we could balance our checkbooks and<br>
organize our recipes.
</p>
<p>
In fact, technology has affected nearly every aspect of our lives -- or my life, anyway.<br>
But technology hasn't had much effect on social behavior, which is probably the one<br>
area where we need it most. With the possible exceptions of soothing fish tank<br>
screen-savers and "simulations" that show the perils of evildoing by exploding the<br>
spleens of undead Nazis, computers have made even less impact on social mores than<br>
Dungeons and Dragons.
</p>
<p>
Not every piece of software, and certainly not every game, can (or should) try to have<br>
social relevance. But it's sure fun to keep one's eyes open for the possibility. That's<br>
how the Mac was created in the first place: computer geeks trying to change the world.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, karma already exists outside the online world -- it's just intangible and<br>
unquantifiable. Do-gooders (darn them!) tend to get what's coming to them; I'm more<br>
likely to go out of my way to help someone who has been helpful to others in the past.<br>
But it would sure be nice to be able to quantify this karma, so that we could get an idea<br>
of someone's "goodness" upon first meeting. Of course, it's possible that trying to<br>
quantify karma like this, putting numbers to it, will just create a sort of "behavioral<br>
economy," whereas the "real" karma, the intangible kind, will continue to exist<br>
independently, however we keep score.
</p>
<p>
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to distribute karma in the real world? If we tracked it<br>
properly, karma would be more important than credit -- as it should be. Someday,<br>
with technology's help, we might be able to point a remote control and push a couple of<br>
buttons to reward that nice librarian or those kids that wrote that great game. Or<br>
finally do something about that granny in her fume-spewing Pinto, that dog-kicking<br>
punk, or the neighbor who mows his lawn at five-thirty in the morning.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, digital karma could revolutionize society -- or maybe it's just a thought<br>
experiment about a potential feature of a future game that might not even ship.
