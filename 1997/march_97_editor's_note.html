<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>

&nbsp;The nerd market has been saturated -- you all have computers -- but what about the<br>
"home market"? I'm no expert on this, but now that I've taken on the persona of home<br>
user myself, I feel better qualified to say why normal people would rather use<br>
calculators and play board games. I recently upgraded to a Power Mac 8500 so that I<br>
could work at home and also to be able to enjoy some fun software like the newly<br>
released electronic version of my favorite board game. Rather than just download<br>
software from an Apple server to use for work, I was going to buy something to play<br>
with to help justify my new expensive hardware purchase -- just like any Mom, Pop,<br>
or kid might do.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I took a trip -- several, actually -- to a barn-like emporium that is Nerd Central in<br>
my neighborhood but a singularly unpleasant place for non-geeks. (The clerks seem to<br>
know that if you have to ask for what you need, you don't belong there, so they ignore<br>
you.) The first few times, I was dismayed to find that the game I wanted had been<br>
released only for Windows and not yet for Macintosh. Finally, when I looked more <br>
closely at the product in the Windows software section, I saw the small print on it that<br>
said "Windows and Mac." Then all I had to do was wait a half hour in line to buy it.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Remember the big furor over wasteful packaging when CDs started replacing record<br>
albums in audio stores? Before long the shelves were redesigned and the extra<br>
packaging eliminated. What did I find in this big box containing a software product for<br>
which I had shelled out 50-plus dollars? Nothing but a CD in its case and a huge piece<br>
of molded black plastic cleverly designed to take up all the rest of the space in the box.<br>
I wondered how much that extra packaging had cost me, but decided to get on with it and<br>
chill out over a good game.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I'll run out of space before I can get through all the other problems I encountered.<br>
Suffice it to say I was dissatisfied with the product, to the point where I would not have<br>
purchased it had I known of its shortcomings ahead of time. It paled in comparison to a<br>
similar shareware game I'd been using (for which, needless to say,&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't have to<br>
drive to a store, search for the product, wait in line, spend a lot of money, and throw<br>
away most of the package).
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The home market won't really take off until the experience of purchasing software<br>
becomes more pleasurable and foolproof. This could mean something more like buying<br>
audio CDs, where you go to a cool store organized by content type and not hardware<br>
type, where you can easily return the product within a short time for any reason, and<br>
where you can even try out the disc before buying it. Or it may mean waiting till the<br>
practice of buying software off the Web has taken hold -- especially inexpensive<br>
shareware, so that satisfaction is guaranteed in advance. Only solutions like these will<br>
roust the home market. Otherwise it's just too much of a pain.

<b>CAROLINE ROSE </b>(crose@apple.com) isn't a typical home user, since she was one of<br>
the first people to use a Macintosh and she cut her teeth before that on a timesharing<br>
system. But that was all in the line of duty, whereas at leisure she uses computers as<br>
little as possible. She's even been known to handwrite letters to friends. Speaking of<br>
which, Caroline has received so little mail from <i>develop </i>readers lately that this issue<br>
is&nbsp;&nbsp;missing a Letters section and she's missing hearing from you. What's on your mind<br>
about <i> develop?</i> Please take a moment to let Caroline know.*
