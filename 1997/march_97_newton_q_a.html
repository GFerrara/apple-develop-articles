<h1>Newton Q &amp; A: Ask the Llama</h1>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I recently saw the announcement of two new Newton devices -- the MessagePad<br>

2000 and the eMate 300 -- and I have a few questions. First, will my application run<br>
fine?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;If your application was written correctly for Newton OS 2.0, for the most part it<br>

will work fine on Newton OS 2.1, which is what the new devices use. "Correctly" here<br>
means that you call only documented functions, including platform file functions where<br>
appropriate. It also means that your application works with different screen sizes by<br>
using GetAppParams in combination with minimum and maximum sizes.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>What are the most important things to check in my application to ensure that it's<br>

completely compatible with the new devices?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;There are four broad areas to check: speed, screen size, views, and PC cards.<br>
<p>
<b>Speed.</b> The new units are faster than the current ones. In the case of the MessagePad<br>
2000, the difference is quite large. Unfortunately, it's possible for some things to be<br>
too fast. The new OS takes care of several speed issues for you -- scrolling, for<br>
example -- but there are still some areas you should check.
</p>
<p>
Check those places where you're doing repeated actions from a viewClickScript. A<br>
typical usage would be a button that will continually perform an action as long as the<br>
user presses it. If you use a loop in a viewClickScript to do the repetition, you may<br>
find that there are too many repetitions or that the repetitive action occurs too<br>
quickly. The same problem can occur if you don't use the scrolling API provided by the<br>
system, as scrolling is one area that has deliberately been slowed down on the<br>
MessagePad 2000.
</p>
<p>
Loops can also cause problems when they're used for timing. In general, you shouldn't<br>
use loops for this purpose; use Ticks instead. If you must use a loop, set the counter<br>
for that loop based on a known reference like Ticks or TimeInSeconds.
</p>
<p>
Operations that used to be long enough to require user feedback may now happen fast<br>
enough that no feedback is required. This can happen in two places:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You may have been deliberately turning on the busy box. The result can be<br>
a busy box that flashes very briefly, which can be distracting.</li>
<li>You may have implemented progress bars using DoProgress, protoStatus,<br>
or even a protoGauge. Try removing the progress indicator and checking<br>
whether the operation is now fast enough. Note that most of the progress<br>
indicators take time to draw and update -- in some cases significantly longer<br>
than the time to do the operation for which the progress is being displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Screen size.</b> Be sure your application works properly in both portrait and landscape<br>
orientation, with the button bar on both the left and the right. In addition to the size of<br>
your overall application on the screen, check areas where you use complex<br>
justification or dynamic allocation of view children. Check that the children are<br>
correctly aligned -- and that there are the correct number of children.
</p>
<p>
Also, be sure your borders don't go outside the application area. Note that borders are<br>
drawn outside the view. You can find your global bounds with the borders by calling<br>
GlobalOuterBox.
</p>
<p>
<b>Views.</b> The most likely problem related to views is assuming that the top left of the<br>
application area is always at (0, 0) in global coordinates. This is no longer the case<br>
since the button bar, which is 46 pixels wide, can be on the left side of the screen. A<br>
typical place for this problem to occur is in a viewClickScript where you do something<br>
with a point that's actually 46 pixels out from where you expect it to be. Rotate to<br>
landscape orientation and put the button bar on the left; then try tapping on the right<br>
side of your application. One sure way to cause problems is to forget to send SyncView<br>
to your base application view after a ReorientToScreen message has been sent.
</p>
<p>
Another possible view problem is that any view can be the keyView. Don't assume that<br>
the keyView can accept text input; in particular, don't use calls like SetValue to jam<br>
the text slot (which may not be there). You may want to check the class of the keyView.
</p>
<p>
<b>PC cards.</b> You should check that your application works when two PC card slots are<br>
being used for storage. Search for the following pieces of bad code:
</p>
<p>
<code>GetStores()[1];&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// BAD -- 0 is the only number documented to work</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>Length(GetStores());&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// doesn't tell you the number of PC cards</code>
</p>
<p>
If you have code like this, you'll have to change it. The first case -- assuming there's a<br>
store at the second position in the array -- is not a good idea. Even if there's a store at<br>
that position, it may not be the same store that was there the last time you checked.<br>
Also note that the positions in the array do not correspond to physical PC card slot<br>
positions. The second case can fail for similar reasons. That is, checking the length of<br>
the array returned by GetStores doesn't tell you how many PC cards are currently<br>
installed.
</p>
<p>
Along the same lines, if you're still using the action (routing) picker to move items to<br>
the card, you should change to using the filing interface. Also, make sure that you use<br>
the FileThis method to move items to different stores, and that you look at the<br>
arguments provided by FileThis; some application code seems to assume that there are<br>
only two stores. For adding soup entries, remember to call AddToDefaulStoreXmit<br>
instead of using the store directly.
</p>
<p>
You might also encounter a problem with endpoints that could use PC card modems. To<br>
set up your modem endpoint, call MakeModemOption, which will construct the correct<br>
options based on the user modem preferences and available PC card modems.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Are there any features that are important to support in the new devices?</i></p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;The most important thing is to make sure your application works. After that, there<br>

are some important updates you can make to support features in the new devices.
</p>
<p>
First, make sure your application can be dragged, assuming of course that it's not<br>
full-screen in all orientations. You can do this by changing your base view to a<br>
protoDragger with either some sort of status bar (preferably newtStatusBar) or a<br>
protoLargeCloseBox. Remember to make sure the borders of the protoDragger will be<br>
contained in the application area; you can use GlobalOuterBox to check this. And while<br>
you're at it, you can check that your application will handle any screen size.
</p>
<p>
You may also want to see whether you can improve your use of screen space. Note that<br>
your major layouts (for example, detail and overview) don't have to be the same size.<br>
The Names application is a good example of this.
</p>
<p>
Another important feature to support is the use of the keyboard. Add the required<br>
keyboard commands to your application. As of this writing you can find this<br>
information in the "User Interface Guidelines for Newton OS 2.1 Keyboard<br>
Enhancements" document. If your application is based on NewtApp, most of this work is<br>
done for you; otherwise you'll have to add almost all the keyboard commands yourself.<br>
Once you've supported the required set, add other commands that make sense for your<br>
application. Don't forget keyboard navigation in your overview.
</p>
<p>
A related feature that's good to support on both Newton OS 2.0 and 2.1 devices is<br>
conditional display of embedded keyboards. You can use the KeyboardConnected global<br>
function to check whether a keyboard is connected; if it is, don't display embedded<br>
keyboards unless they're highly specialized.
</p>
<p>
If you're using the infrared (IR) communications tool, you should use IrDA if possible.<br>
This will give you a faster transfer rate and a much more robust protocol. If your<br>
application might be communicating with older units, be sure to give your users a<br>
choice of IR connection types, since older units can only use the ASK protocol. Newton<br>
OS 2.1 still supports all the IR options from 2.0. Note that using the action menu to<br>
beam information will do the right thing.
</p>
<p>
You should also take advantage of the grayscale feature, by using the new RGB-based<br>
gray shades (that is, kRGB_Gray1 through 15) instead of the dithered gray patterns.<br>
Dithered patterns are usually specified as vfGray, vfLightGray, and so on. You can also<br>
change your own patterns to use grayscale. Although the dithered patterns still work,<br>
the true gray RGB shades look a lot better. You'll want to wrap the specification in a<br>
check to make sure that grayscale is available. Naturally you'll want to update<br>
important parts of your application to use grayscale -- for example, your splash<br>
screen and Extras icon.
</p>
<p>
Finally, if you're targeting the eMate and the education market, you should update your<br>
application for multiuser mode. This could be an extensive change, since you'll have to<br>
modify your interface and the names of all soups that you save.
