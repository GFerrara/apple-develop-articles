<p>
&nbsp;Dear Readers,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The more observant among you may have noticed that we've made yet another change to<br>
<i>&nbsp;develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;with respect to how it's dated. The last change happened with Issue 10, when<br>
we stopped designating issues with the current season and went back to using the<br>
current month, because the season isn't the same around the world. Now we've moved<br>
the date ahead by one month -- also to accommodate worldwide distribution.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;For the terminally curious, here are the details: <i> Apple Direct</i> , our vanguard of<br>
information for business and technical decison makers, doesn't reach other countries<br>
until two to eight weeks after it's distributed in the U.S.; it might, for example, be<br>
folded into a local mailing whose schedule doesn't coincide. So by the time some<br>
non-U.S. developers see <i> Apple Direct</i> , they think they've been sent a past issue<br>
rather than the latest one. To help convey to them that it is indeed the latest issue, it's<br>
now dated with a month that's closer to when they'll see it. The <i> Developer CD Series </i><br>
disc, <i>Apple Direct</i> , and <i>develop </i> all need to be in sync -- so there you have it. What is<br>
now the December issue of<i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;was the Autumn issue last year and the October<br>
issue in 1990 (when our production cycle was a month out of phase from where it is<br>
now). Anyway, we hope those of you in the U.S. agree there's no harm in a little time<br>
travel forward.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;A little time travel forward would be really handy for me while I'm writing these<br>
editorials, because I don't always know what the state of the <i> develop</i> -related world<br>
will be two months in advance (that's the lag time before you actually read this). In<br>
Issue 11's editorial, for example, I couldn't alert you to<i> develop</i> 's being in a new<br>
format on the <i> Developer CD Series</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;disc, because at that time we weren't sure it would<br>
make it onto that disc. Yes, we've responded to your complaints about <i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;in<br>
HyperCard&#174; by switching to that popular viewing tool that you may know as<br>
"BlueNote" -- now "Apple DocViewer" -- the same tool that's used for viewing <i> New</i><br>
<i>Inside Macintosh</i> .
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The Developer CD corresponding to Issue 11 contained a prerelease version of<br>
DocViewer that still needed some work; for example, it wouldn't work at all on a<br>
Macintosh Plus. In lieu of a time machine, I've consulted the Magic 8-Ball DTS uses to<br>
answer developer questions, and it tells me that the CD corresponding to this issue of <br>
<i>develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;-- called the "November/December" CD, to ease the transition -- will<br>
include a version 1.0 release of DocViewer along with Issues 11 and 12 in DocViewer<br>
format. Version 1.0 should work on Macintosh Plus and newer models, with system<br>
software version 6.0 and later. Back issues of <i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;will eventually also make their<br>
way over into this format (the 8-Ball is hazy regarding just when this will happen).<br>
We'd really like your feedback on DocViewer and how well it works for reading <br>
<i>develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;(or anything else). Please check it out, and send your flames or even praise to<br>
AppleLink DEV.CD.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Whoops -- did I say "DTS"? Old habits die hard. Another change we're gradually<br>
making in <i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;is to shift from "Developer Technical Support" (DTS) to<br>
"Developer Support Center" (DSC). As you may have read in the April 1992 issue of <br>
<i>Apple Direct</i> , the DSC is a gateway to DTS as well as other support-related resources.<br>
It provides a focal point for developer queries -- a single AppleLink address,<br>
DEVSUPPORT, and a single phone number, (408)974-4897. Developers who aren't<br>
Apple Associates or Partners can contact the DSC for limited nontechnical support and<br>
referrals. We'll be adjusting to this change along with others that are creeping in:<br>
Tech Note references no longe rnumbered; <i>Inside Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;references that include<br>
<i>New Inside Macintosh</i> ; DocViewer as the on-line viewing tool; postdating; and other<br>
changes that I foresee but don't dare reveal lest I upset the delicate balance of the<br>
universe.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I feel compelled to explain my bizarre trivia answer in Issue 11, about the<br>
upside-down character that wasn't. I claimed the offending character was "8," which<br>
on the contrary looks perfectly OK -- not at all topheavy -- in printed <i> develop</i> . It<br>
turns out that this "8" is topheavy only in LaserWriter output. That will teach me to<br>
use a media-specific question! I think I'll quit while I'm behind and lay off trivia<br>
questions altogether for a while (even though I'll miss those friendly letters from<br>
you).

<p>
<b>CAROLINE ROSE</b> (AppleLink CROSE) has been writing software documentation since<br>
before there were personal computers or even lava lamps. Her total of five years at<br>
Apple is (to use the jargon she helped coin in <i> Inside Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume I) a<br>
discontinuous selection, interrupted by as many years at NeXT. When not reading,<br>
writing, coining, or otherwise obsessing over words, Caroline enjoys the outdoors. (As<br>
songwriter Greg Brown puts it, "People say small things when they stay too long in<br>
little rooms.") The highlight of her summer was "swimming Lava Falls": being thrown<br>
from a raft that capsized in the largest rapid (a 37-foot drop) on the Colorado River<br>
in the Grand Canyon, and being rescued by a small paddleboat that braved the next<br>
rapid with 12 worried souls aboard. Talk about an adrenaline rush! And she lived to<br>
tell the tale.*
