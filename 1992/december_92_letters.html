LETTERS<br>
<p>
<b>LETTERS POSTAL DEVILS EATING CDS?</b><br>
<i>develop </i> is the most exciting piece of regular mail I get after Japanese animation<br>
laserdiscs. I joyfully received Issue 11 but unfortunately the wolverines in the Postal<br>
Service dined on some of the plastic and no CD was to be found! Help!<br>
-- Jim Perry
</p>
<p>
Would you consider mailing <i>develop </i> in a nonperforated plastic wrapping? The<br>
perforation was two- thirds torn when I received it.<br>
-- Eva Schlesinger
</p>
<p>
I really enjoy <i>develop</i> , but I have to say that I've enjoyed it less recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time<br>
ago the CDs came in a small envelope well protected inside the magazine, and<br>
everything was fine. Now, <i>develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;is shipped with the CD in its own holder, which<br>
would seem to be a fabulous idea except that you were blind-sided by the U.S. Post<br>
Office. Every month since the CD got its own holder, the Post Office has mangled my<br>
plastic bag, CD holder, and magazine. Today my <i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;issue 11 arrived sans CD. I<br>
called the subscription office&nbsp;&nbsp;(1-800-545-9364) and they promise to send me<br>
another within four weeks.(!?) Growl.<br>
-- Bob Cent
</p>
<p>
<i>Most of the mail I get is, unfortunately, on this subject. Our Production Manager,</i><br>
<i>Hartley Lesser, really has been working on it. Even with Issue 11, we took a small</i><br>
<i>step toward solving the problem: since many people thought someone was breaking</i><br>
<i>open the package and stealing the CD, we inserted a thick sheet of paper over the CD so</i><br>
<i>that it wouldn't be visible. But complaints of torn packaging still came in, so clearly</i><br>
<i>the packaging just wasn't sturdy enough. The packaging around Issue 12 and its CD</i><br>
<i>should be about twice as thick as before and have no perforation. If that doesn't work</i><br>
<i>we'll try something else.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Issue 7 was the last one to list the 800 number you used to contact the subscription</i><br>
<i>office (though it stubbornly has still shown up on our renewal notice). The correct</i><br>
<i>number is 1-800-877-5548. The person you spoke to normally doesn't handle calls</i><br>
<i>regarding </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;develop <i>and didn't know that replacement CDs should be mailed within a day</i><br>
<i>or two of notification of the problem. Sorry for the mixup. We hope you'll never need</i><br>
<i>that service again!</i><br>

<b>SCREENWRITING CAVEAT</b><br>
Your Issue 11 column on drawing to the screen was really useful to me. I had an<br>
animation program that wrote directly to the screen and it worked fine. But when I<br>
upgraded to a new accelerator card my program kept crashing. I spent months trying to<br>
figure out the problem. But your article fixed it straight away. All I needed was the<br>
SwapMMUMode calls. I don't know why the previous card didn't require them, but my<br>
program works fine now.<br>
-- Tony Cooper
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for your interest in the column. We're glad it was helpful to you. One thing we</i><br>
<i>want to be sure to mention is that writing directly to the screen will break for sure on</i><br>
<i>future Macintosh systems based on RISC technology. And we again want to stress that</i><br>
<i>the only applications that should even consider writing directly to the screen are</i><br>
<i>games and other animation programs.</i><br>
<i>-- Brigham Stevens and Bill Guschwan</i>

<p>
<b>USER-FRIENDLY RENEWING</b><br>
Recently I received a couple of renewal notices for <i> develop </i> in the mail. In trying to<br>
decipher these notices, I realized that user friendliness is something we should all be<br>
aiming for not just in thesoftware we write, but in everything we do. It's interesting<br>
how working with the Macintosh makes one aware of human interface issues in<br>
everyday life. Anyway, I think there are a few ways in which the <i> develop </i> renewal<br>
notices could be made more user friendly:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Leave a bigger space for writing the credit card number.</li>
<li>Clearly indicate on the renewal notice the date my subscription expires.</li>
<li>Is there any reason why the renewal notices are printed in red ink?</li>
</ol>
<p>
--Tim Hammett
</p>
<p>
<i>We're in the process of making the changes you suggested to the </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;develop <i>renewal</i><br>
<i>notice.</i>
</p>
<i><ol><li>We'll leave a bigger space for writing the credit card number.<br>
</li><li>The notice will indicate when the subscription expires. You can also find<br>
this out at any time from your mailing label: the number that appears on a<br>
line by itself at the top of the label indicates the last issue you'll receive<br>
unless you renew.<br>
</li><li>The reason for the red ink is so that this little piece of paper doesn't get<br>
lost on your desk. But you've inspired us to change it to a more readable,<br>
deeper red.</li></ol></i>
<p>
<i>We're also correcting the 800 phone number on the notice, to 1-800-877-5548.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for your letter. Without it, I would have assumed that the renewal notice</i><br>
<i>(which isn't really in my domain) was in great shape. I appreciate the enlightenment.</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>REUSED CDS: IS IT ART?</b><br>
In Issue 10 of <i>develop</i> , Bruce Radford stated that he wasn't sure what to do with his old<br>
CDs. He felt that he should recycle them, but he wasn't sure how. Well, I have a<br>
suggestion.
</p>
<p>
Many people forget that reusing something is often even better than straight recycling.<br>
My school would have many uses for old issues of the <i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;CD. I know a few friends<br>
who would love copies, no matter how old; I could use them in a programming class;<br>
and other students could cut them up to make jewelry for school fundraisers. I also<br>
have many uses for old 256K SIMMs, which seem to be becoming about as useful as<br>
pennies now.
</p>
<p>
So go ahead and send the stuff that you think no one needs to me, or to a school near you.<br>

<p>
<i>Thanks for the idea. Day care centers and children's museums have also been mentioned</i><br>
<i>as possible destinations for old CDs. We suggest that before giving away CDs for for art</i><br>
<i>projects, developers put a deep scratch through the data side of the CD if it contains</i><br>
<i>any confidential or licensed data.&nbsp;&nbsp;For some wild and crazy ideas on this from Apple's</i><br>
<i>Developer Support Center, see the&nbsp;&nbsp;Q &amp; A on page 126.</i><br>
<i>-- Caroline Rose</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>DEVELOP INTERNET ADDRESS</b><br>
I'm on the Internet and <i> develop </i> contains only AppleLink addresses. I'm guessing that<br>
crose@applelink.apple.com is your Internet address. <i> develop </i> really should have an<br>
Internet address for academic developers to send e-mail to.<br>
-- Eric Kofoid
</p>
<p>
<i>Adding "applelink.apple.com" to any AppleLink address converts it to an Internet</i><br>
<i>address. The Internet addresses for me and </i> develop<i>'s Technical Editor Dave Johnson</i><br>
<i>are listed on the last page of every issue.</i><br>
<i>-- Caroline Rose</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>BACK ISSUES CONUNDRUM</b><br>
I noticed that your back issues are listed at $13 in <i> develop </i> and at $10 in the APDA<br>
catalog. Why the discrepancy? Who should I order the back issues from?<br>
-- Michael Tackie
</p>
<p>
P.S. Great magazine. Very technical. I don't understand everything, but that's good; it<br>
forces me to become a better programmer.
</p>
<p>
<i>You pay a $3 shipping charge when you order from APDA, so it adds up to $13 in the</i><br>
<i>end.</i><br>
<i>-- Caroline Rose P.S. Thanks!</i>
</p>
<h2>CORRECTION TO APPLE EVENTS ARTICLE IN ISSUE 10</h2>
<p>
The "Apple Event Objects and You" article in <i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 10 contains two errors in<br>
the printed sample code. The first problem is that five lines were omitted from the end<br>
of GetWindowIndex. The code at the top of page 25 should be changed from
</p>
<pre>    return noErr;
}</pre>
<p>
to
</p>
<pre>if ((rawIndex&gt; numWindows)||(rawIndex&lt;= 0)) {
    *index = 0;
    return errAENoSuchObject;
} else
    *index = rawIndex;
    return noErr
}</pre>
<p>
The second bug is in the routine WriteRectToken (page 30). The following call
</p>
<pre>BlockMove(*thisRectDesc.dataHandle,
        &amp;tokenPtr-&gt;theRect,sizeof(Rect));</pre>
<p>
should be changed to
</p>
<pre>BlockMove(*thisRectDesc.dataHandle,
        (Ptr)tokenPtr-&gt;theRect,sizeof(Rect));</pre>
<p>
Since theRect is actually a pointer to a rectangle (see the declaration at the top of page<br>
29), the first version would have destroyed the pointer and four bytes of the following<br>
long integer.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Doug McKenna, the author of Resorcerer, for pointing out these problems.
