<h2>SIMPLE TEXT WINDOWS VIA THE TERMINAL MANAGER</h2>

<p>
<i>&nbsp;A major feature of System 7 is the fact that the Macintosh Communications Toolbox is</i><br>
<i>built in and available for all to use. This article presents code that uses the</i><br>
<i>Communications Toolbox Terminal Manager to implement a simple text window that</i><br>
<i>can be dropped into any application. The window is useful for displaying debugging or</i><br>
<i>status information such as variable values or memory usage during application</i><br>
<i>development.</i>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Many times, when writing code, I've wished I had some sort of text repository, a place<br>
to write some quick text. I tried to use TextEdit for this at first, but its structures<br>
grow as you add text, so my memory accounting became confused. Sprinkling DebugStr<br>
calls throughout the code told me what I needed to know most of the time, but they were<br>
interruptive to both the user interface and timing- sensitive functions. Finally, I<br>
turned to the Terminal Manager because in addition to a terminal tool it contains the<br>
nuts and bolts necessary to display a text window and uses a fixed amount of memory. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;TermWindow, included on the<i>Developer CD Series</i> disc, consists of a few simple<br>
routines that use the Terminal Manager and a terminal tool to display text in a<br>
Macintosh window. The package can be used in any application for purposes such as<br>
displaying variable values, heap checks, memory usage, and routine paths. I've even<br>
used some features of the terminal tool to grab attention, like having text blink when I<br>
encounter an OSErr or when memory begins to get tight.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Figure 1 shows a sample TermWindow terminal emulation window. I used the<br>
Developer Technical Support (DTS) Sample application (included with MPW) and the<br>
Apple VT102 tool to produce the display. The double-high/double-wide text shown in<br>
the figure is a feature of the VT102 emulator. I displayed it by writing the escape<br>
sequences shown on the next page to the window. (Two lines are needed for double-high<br>
text, one to display the top half of the line, and one for the bottom half.)

<h2>THE HEADER FILE</h2>
<p>
The file TermWindow.h defines a basic TermWindowRec structure that TermWindow<br>
uses internally for housekeeping and for storage of other structures, including the<br>
handles for the terminal and control records. 
</p>
<pre>struct TermWindowRec
{
    WindowRecord    fWindowRec;     // so it can be a WindowPtr
    short           fWindowType;    // for application use
    TermHandle      fTermHandle;    // CTB terminal handle
    TermEnvironRec  fTermEnvirons;  // environment info
    ControlHandle   fVertScroll;    // vertical scroller
    ControlHandle   fHorizScroll;   // horizontal scroller
    Point           fMinWindowSize; // min. width/height of window
};
typedef struct TermWindowRec TermWindowRec;
typedef TermWindowRec *TermWindowPtr;</pre>
<p>
Six prototype routines, used to put TermWindow to work in an application, are also<br>
defined in the header file TermWindow.h. 
</p>
<pre>pascal  OSErr   InitTermMgr(void);
pascal  OSErr   NewTermWindow(TermWindowPtr *termPtr,
                                const Rect *boundsRect,
                                ConstStr255Param title,
                                Boolean visible,
                                short theProc,
                                WindowPtr behind,
                                Boolean goAwayFlag,
                                Str31 toolName);
pascal  OSErr   DisposeTermWindow(TermWindowPtr termPtr);
pascal  Boolean IsTermWindowEvent(TermWindowPtr termPtr,
                                const EventRecord *theEventPtr);
pascal  void    HandleTermWindowEvent(TermWindowPtr termPtr,
                                const EventRecord *theEventPtr);
pascal  OSErr   WriteToTermWindow(TermWindowPtr termPtr,
                                Ptr theData, Size *lengthOfData);</pre>
<h2>HOW TO USE TERMWINDOW</h2>
<p>
The six TermWindow routines are easy to use. After normal Macintosh manager<br>
initialization, you'll initialize the Terminal Manager with a call to InitTermMgr and<br>
then call NewTermWindow. The NewTermWindow function allocates the<br>
TermWindowPtr, terminal handle, and control handles. It also creates a Macintosh<br>
window complete with scroll bars and then attaches the terminal emulation region to<br>
the window with a call to TMNew. (See the next section for more on initialization.)
</p>
<p>
There are two functions to handle events, IsTermWindowEvent and<br>
HandleTermWindowEvent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These should be placed in your application event loop.<br>
IsTermWindowEvent determines whether the incoming event is for the emulation<br>
window by looking at the EventRecord structure, and it also provides time to the<br>
terminal emulator by calling TMIdle. HandleTermWindowEvent is a dispatcher that<br>
routes the event to routines that in turn call the Terminal Manager to process the<br>
event. These routines are discussed in more detail in the section "Handling Events."
</p>
<p>
The WriteToTermWindow routine, discussed later in this article under "Writing<br>
Text," uses the Terminal Manager to display your data in the terminal emulation<br>
window. And finally, DisposeTermWindow performs window and structure cleanup.
</p>
<h2>INITIALIZATION</h2>
<p>
The InitTermMgr routine prepares to initialize the Terminal Manager by checking the<br>
status of three Gestalt selectors: gestaltCTBVersion, gestaltCRMAttr, and<br>
gestaltTermMgrAttr. (We don't have to check for Gestalt, since MPW 3.2 contains the<br>
code to make Gestalt work.) The gestaltCTBVersion selector tells us which version of<br>
the Communications Toolbox is available, thereby letting us know that it exists. The<br>
gestaltCRMAttr and gestaltTermMgrAttr selectors tell us, respectively, whether the<br>
Communications Resource Manager (which must be initialized for tool resource<br>
handling) and Terminal Manager are available for use. InitTermMgr then calls the<br>
Communications Toolbox initialization routines if each Gestalt call returns a value of<br>
true. It all looks like this:
</p>
<pre>pascal OSErr InitTermMgr(void)
{
    OSErr   result = noErr;
    Boolean hasCTB, hasCRM, hasTM;
    long    gestaltResult;
   
    hasCTB = (Gestalt(gestaltCTBVersion, &amp;gestaltResult) ?
                            false : gestaltResult &gt; 0);
    hasCRM = (Gestalt(gestaltCRMAttr, &amp;gestaltResult) ?
                            false : gestaltResult != 0);
    hasTM = (Gestalt(gestaltTermMgrAttr, &amp;gestaltResult) ?
                            false : gestaltResult != 0);
    if ((hasCTB) &amp;&amp; (hasCRM) &amp;&amp; (hasTM))
        if (noErr == (result = InitCRM()))
            if (noErr == (result = InitCTBUtilities()))
                if (noErr == (result = InitTM()))
   
    return (result);
} /*InitTermMgr*/</pre>
<p>
You may wonder whether the Communications Toolbox requires that the Macintosh<br>
Toolbox managers be started up at initialization time. The Communications Toolbox<br>
managers are loaded in the system heap, so you may have other reasons for starting<br>
them up in your initialization routine, but TermWindow's only requirement is that<br>
InitTermMgr be called at some point beforeNewTermWindow. Because the<br>
NewTermWindow routine has the potential to allocate nonrelocatable memory, calling<br>
InitTermMgr and NewTermWindow at initialization removes the possibility of heap<br>
fragmentation. 
</p>
<p>
NewTermWindow begins by validating each parameter that was passed and assigns<br>
default values if necessary (see Table 1 below; refer to "The Header File" earlier in<br>
this article for the NewTermWindow declaration). You might notice that a good deal of<br>
the parameter list to NewTermWindow is very similar to that for the NewWindow<br>
function in the Macintosh Toolbox.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NewTermWindow parameter list is designed to<br>
provide as much window control as possible when calling NewWindow, while also<br>
adding the functionality for the terminal emulation region.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls to NewControl attach<br>
scroll bars to the window being created. 
</p>
<p>

<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Once the Macintosh window is ready, NewTermWindow attaches the terminal emulation<br>
region to the window with a call to TMNew. Parameters to the TMNew routine tell the<br>
terminal tool, via the Terminal Manager, how to set up the emulation. (Terminal tools,<br>
not the Terminal Manager, implement the emulation.) The basic TMNew prototype is<br>
as follows:
</p>
<pre>pascal TermHandle TMNew(const Rect *termRect,
            const Rect *viewRect,
            TMFlags flags, short procID, WindowPtr owner,
            TerminalSendProcPtr sendProc,
            TerminalCacheProcPtr cacheProc,
            TerminalBreakProcPtr breakProc,
            TerminalClikLoopProcPtr clikLoop,
            TerminalEnvironsProcPtr environsProc,
            long refCon, long userData);</pre>
<p>
In TermWindow's case, NewTermWindow sets termRect and viewRect to the portRect of<br>
the window's grafPort minus the scroll bar area and sets the flags parameter to 0L.<br>
(This enables the terminal tool to put up custom menus or provide error alerts to the<br>
user.) The procID parameter is a terminal tool reference number (obtained with<br>
TMGetProcID) that tells the Terminal Manager which tool to use. The owner parameter<br>
is set to the WindowPtr of our Macintosh window. The procedure pointers, refCon, and<br>
userData are all set to nil or 0L. 
</p>
<pre>termPtr-&gt;fTermHandle = TMNew(&amp;termRect, &amp;termRect, 0L, procID,
                            (WindowPtr)(*termPtr), nil, nil, nil,
                            nil, nil, 0L, 0L);</pre>
<h2>HANDLING EVENTS</h2>
<p>
Your application's main event loop should use the two event-handling routines,<br>
IsTermWindowEvent and HandleTermWindowEvent, to process events for the emulation<br>
window and to determine whether the event has already been handled. I use the<br>
following fragment just after calling WaitNextEvent; it sets the gotEvent flag to false<br>
when TermWindow has processed the event, so that I don't try to handle the event<br>
twice. 
</p>
<pre>if (IsTermWindowEvent(&amp;gTheEvent, gTermWindowPtr)) {
    HandleTermWindowEvent(&amp;gTheEvent, gTermWindowPtr);
    gotEvent = false;
}</pre>
<p>
IsTermWindowEvent uses FindWindow or the message field of the event record to<br>
determine whether the event is for the terminal window. (See<i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume<br>
I, page 250, for details.) IsTermWindowEvent is also a convenient place to give the<br>
terminal tool idle time; it calls TMIdle to give the tool a chance to draw text or blink<br>
the cursor. (Some terminal tools also have the ability to display blinking text; that<br>
would be done here also.)
</p>
<p>
The HandleTermWindowEvent routine is fairly straightforward, especially if you've<br>
written window- and scroll-handling code before. As is true when handling normal<br>
windows, the what field of the event record defines the work to be done. Terminal<br>
Manager routines exist for most of this work, so handling events is primarily a matter<br>
of calling the right routine at the appropriate time. For example, window activation<br>
and deactivation are communicated to the tool with a call to TMActivate.
</p>
<pre>TMActivate(termPtr-&gt;fTermHandle,
            (0 != (theEventPtr-&gt;modifiers &amp; activeFlag)));</pre>
<p>
Figure 2 illustrates how a message like TMActivate is routed to accomplish its goal.<br>
The Terminal Manager receives the TMActivate call and routes the tmActivateMsg<br>
message to the terminal tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terminal tool then takes the opportunity to call<br>
Macintosh Toolbox routines such as InsertMenu or RemoveMenu (if the tool uses a<br>
custom menu, as the VT102 tool does) to keep the screen up to date.
</p>
<p>
Update events are handled by a call to TMUpdate sandwiched between BeginUpdate and<br>
EndUpdate. You'll just need to pass TMUpdate the update region freshly calculated by<br>
BeginUpdate. Of course, if you check for an empty region first, you won't have to call<br>
TMUpdate at all. 
</p>
<pre>BeginUpdate((WindowPtr)termPtr);
    if (nil != ((WindowPtr)termPtr)-&gt;visRgn)
        TMUpdate(termPtr-&gt;fTermHandle, ((WindowPtr)termPtr)-&gt;visRgn);
EndUpdate((WindowPtr)termPtr);</pre>
<p>
<img src="img/136.gif" width="555 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2 </b>Calling TMActivate
</p>
<p>
Mouse-click handling is also fairly traditional. FindWindow is used to determine<br>
where in the window the click took place, and Terminal Manager routines are called to<br>
let the terminal tool know what to do. When a zoom or grow event causes the size of the<br>
emulation rectangle to change, the window's portRect gets passed to TMResize. If<br>
FindWindow returns inContent, FindControl is used to determine the control in which<br>
the click occurred, so that TermWindow will know whether to scroll horizontally or<br>
vertically. The partCode returned from FindControl tells how much to scroll by<br>
indicating the part of the control where the click took place. If FindControl returns nil<br>
for the ControlHandle parameter, the click is in the emulation region and TMClick is<br>
called.
</p>
<h2>WRITING TEXT</h2>
<p>
Writing data is easy via the WriteToTermWindow routine. Here's an example of a<br>
WriteToTermWindow call with tempString declared as a char array:
</p>
<pre>sprintf(tempString, "Hello, world");
dataLength = strlen(tempString);
osResult = WriteToTermWindow(termPtr, tempString, &amp;dataLength);</pre>
<p>
In a debugging situation, you might want to do something like the following to keep<br>
track of heap size:
</p>
<pre>gAppHeapRef -= FreeMem();
if (gAppHeapRef) {
    sprintf(tempString, "\t\t#M# App. heap grew by %ld bytes",
                    gAppHeapRef);
    dataLength = strlen(tempString);
    osResult = WriteToTermWindow(termPtr, tempString, &amp;dataLength);
}</pre>
<p>
WriteToTermWindow hands the data off to the terminal tool, via a call to TMStream.<br>
You might be tempted here to think that the data should appear in the window<br>
immediately, but it doesn't--it's simply put in the terminal tool buffer. The terminal<br>
tool waits for a TMUpdate or TMIdle before actually writing to the window. Another<br>
point to remember when working with terminal tools is that display fonts are<br>
controlled by the terminal tool; in fact, many use specific terminal fonts. 
</p>
<h2>NOW IT'S YOUR TURN . . .</h2>
<p>
That's really all there is to using this simple text window. Now that you have some<br>
base code to work from, you might want to add the communication abilities needed to<br>
talk to another computer by using Connection Manager calls like CMRead or CMWrite<br>
and telling the terminal tool when to use them with procedure pointer parameters to<br>
TMNew. How about extending TermWindow to write all data displayed to a file? Or if<br>
you're really up to a challenge, try adding a scroll-back cache to store data that gets<br>
scrolled out of the emulator. Just scrolling the data around is not too difficult, but<br>
brush up on your region handling when you try to work with selections.
</p>
<p>
I hope you find the TermWindow package useful. Put it to work, add some features, and<br>
pass it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything should evolve over time.
