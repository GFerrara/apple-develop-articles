<p>
The Macintosh has always provided animation capabilities. From the early Macintosh<br>
128K to current CPUs, animation has consistently played a large part in the<br>
development of software. And though CPU models continue to change, the theories and<br>
concepts behind animation have stayed basically the same. Simply stated, animation is<br>
the process of stepping through a sequence of images, each slightly different from the<br>
previous. 
</p>
<p>
The thought of animation on the Macintosh usually brings to mind games and<br>
multimedia, when in fact the actual use of animation is more prevalent than most<br>
people imagine. I'll describe some common uses and methods of performing animation<br>
and get you started on writing your own animation sequences. 
</p>
<p>
<b>METHOD 1: PRIMITIVE BUT EFFECTIVE</b><br>
One of the most fundamental methods of animation is using the srcXor transfer mode.<br>
The basic idea is that once you've drawn something in this mode, you can erase it<br>
simply by drawing it again, restoring the bits underneath to their previous state.<br>
Primitive though it may be, this method is common to many applications. Probably the<br>
most obvious example of it can be found in the Finder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar to even the novice<br>
Macintosh user is the dotted rectangle that often appears during desktop navigation.<br>
The movement of the dotted rectangle, which appears when the user selects multiple<br>
icons or drags windows across the desktop, is a simple form of animation. The dotted<br>
rectangle is also used to create the zooming effect when desktop folders are opened and<br>
closed. 
</p>
<p>
To use this method, you set the current transfer mode to srcXor before drawing the<br>
object you plan to animate. In the desktop example, the Finder switches to srcXor mode<br>
and then draws the dotted rectangle with a simple FrameRect call, with the PenPat set<br>
to 50% gray. The movement of the dotted rectangle is accomplished by redrawing the<br>
rectangle at its previous position before drawing it at its new location. With srcXor<br>
mode, simply redrawing the rectangle at the same position restores the desktop to its<br>
original state. So by repeatedly drawing and redrawing the rectangle in its new<br>
position, you float a frame across the screen without damaging the contents of the<br>
desktop. 
</p>
<p>
As a variation on the dotted rectangle, applications use what's called the "marching<br>
ants" effect. With this effect, the bounding frame gives the illusion that the dashed<br>
lines or "ants" are moving around the edges of the box, thereby producing an animated<br>
and more interesting visual appearance. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/237.gif" width="354 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
The marching ants effect is simple to create. The most common way to do this is with a<br>
simple 8-by- 8-bit pattern. To create the illusion, you draw a bounding frame by<br>
calling FrameRect, with the PenMode set to srcXor and the PenPat set to a pattern<br>
defined with diagonal stripes (see the illustration below). Shifting the pattern up one<br>
row, and then wrapping the first row of the pattern to the last row, creates the effect. <br>
If the rows were shifted down rather than up, the ants would appear to move in the<br>
opposite direction. In either case, the ants typically start at one corner of the box and<br>
then end at the opposite corner. 
</p>
<p>
As with the dotted rectangle, the frame is continually drawn and redrawn, but this<br>
time with each new updated pattern. Note the difference between the two effects when<br>
the frame is drawn: With the ants, the frame is constantly being drawn and redrawn<br>
even if the rectangle's coordinates haven't changed. With the dotted rectangle, the<br>
frame is redrawn only when its position has changed. Since no animation takes place<br>
when the dotted rectangle is sitting in the same position, it's not necessary to<br>
continually draw the frame in that case. 
</p>
<p>
<b>METHOD 2: NOT SEEING IS MORE THAN BELIEVING</b><br>
Another method of performing animation is to use off-screen drawing. With this<br>
method, the actual drawing is being done behind the user's back. The animation frames<br>
are prepared off-screen and quickly transferred to the screen with CopyBits to create<br>
the animation sequence. Regardless of what CPU you're running, this method can<br>
provide excellent animation effects. And with the advent of GWorlds to simplify the<br>
process of building off-screen environments, performing animation with this<br>
technique has become much easier. 
</p>
<p>
In this section I'll provide some important points to consider when building your own<br>
off-screen world and describe how to apply these off-screen worlds to animation. For<br>
a detailed description of creating your own custom GDevices, cGrafPorts, and pixMaps,<br>
see the Macintosh Technical Note "Principia Off-Screen Graphics Environments."
</p>
<p>
Before even considering off-screen animation, you need to determine whether your<br>
Macintosh has enough memory for creating the off-screen environment. Without<br>
sufficient memory, you might as well forget it. Having high-performance,<br>
high-quality animation isn't cheap. Most of what determines the amount of required<br>
memory is the off-screen world's dimensions and pixel depth. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Typically, or at least for this method, the dimensions of the off-screen<br>
world are the same as those of the entire on-screen area.</li>
<li>For the depth of the off-screen world, you'll need to determine whether<br>
it's based on the depth of the images used in the window or on the depth of the<br>
GDevice intersecting the window. In the case where the GDevice is set to direct<br>
colors, you may want to create only an 8-bit off-screen world to save memory<br>
if your images use only 256 or fewer colors. On the other hand, you may want<br>
to create an off-screen world equal to the depth of the GDevice containing the<br>
window, for better data transfer performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once you've determined the dimensions and depth for the off-screen world, you're<br>
ready to create the off-screen environment. Note that if you're using the GWorlds<br>
introduced with 32-Bit QuickDraw, many of the off-screen initialization procedures<br>
have been simplified. Also, with certain video display cards, the GWorlds can be cached<br>
into the NuBusTM card's memory, providing even better performance when off-screen<br>
worlds are used.
</p>
<p>
To create the off-screen environment, you pass NewGWorld the off-screen<br>
dimensions, depth, and color table, and the routine creates the environment or warns<br>
you if there wasn't sufficient memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After you've made all the required memory<br>
checks and created your off-screen environment, either by hand or with NewGWorld,<br>
the next step is to create the animation sequence. 
</p>
<p>
In the simplest case, the off-screen world is used to store an identical copy of what's<br>
displayed on the screen. Rather than erasing and drawing the moving object on-screen,<br>
you perform all this in the off- screen world. Once the moving object has been drawn<br>
in its new position, the off-screen image is transferred to the screen. By continually<br>
drawing the next frame of the moving object in the off-screen world before displaying<br>
it on the screen, you produce the animation effect. The following steps describe the<br>
process. 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Assuming that the entire window is being used for the animation, create<br>
an off-screen environment of the same dimensions as the window, either by<br>
hand or with NewGWorld. When you're defining the depth and color table of the<br>
off-screen world, remember that QuickDraw requires extra time to map<br>
colors when the destination GDevice's depth and color table are different from<br>
those of the source. </li>
<li>Switch to the off-screen grafPort and GDevice and draw the background<br>
image. This is the image that the object will be moved on top of; typically it<br>
won't change. </li>
<li>Draw the object that will be moved or animated into the off-screen world.<br>
Actually, any image not part of the background image should be drawn at this<br>
time. Also, since the object overwrites the background image, the background<br>
under the object will eventually need to be restored. </li>
<li>Switch back to the on-screen grafPort and GDevice and use CopyBits to<br>
transfer the off-screen pixMap to the screen. </li>
</ol>
<p>
These steps create just one frame of the animation sequence. To create the full<br>
sequence, repeat the last three steps until the animation is complete. In step 2, instead<br>
of redrawing the entire background, you may want to redraw just the areas that need to<br>
be restored, if that information is available. By redrawing just a portion of the<br>
damaged background, you'll notice improved performance, especially when working<br>
with higher pixel depths. 
</p>
<p>
Besides providing a quick introduction to off-screen animation, this method has the<br>
advantage that it's simple and straightforward. Since all the objects and images are<br>
drawn at one time and in the same environment, it's easy to create your sequences and<br>
synchronize the animation for any moving object. However, as mentioned earlier,<br>
large off-screen images at higher pixel depths can really affect the performance of the<br>
animation. To overcome this problem, you need to use multiple off-screen worlds. 
</p>
<p>
<b>METHOD 3: SWITCHING INTO HIGH GEAR</b><br>
The concept of multilayer off-screen worlds isn't much different from the basics of<br>
off-screen animation. Rather than having just one off-screen environment, you've<br>
also got an intermediate off- screen layer in which all the actual drawing is completed,<br>
leaving the background layer undamaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So unlike the previous method, where one<br>
off-screen world was used for storing the background and the moving object, this<br>
method uses two separate off-screen worlds to maintain this information. The<br>
following steps describe how the intermediate layer fits in. 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Again, create the background off-screen layer with the same dimensions<br>
as the window. </li>
<li>Switch the current grafPort and GDevice to the background layer, then<br>
draw the background image. This layer will never change, since its main<br>
purpose is to restore the overwritten areas of the intermediate layer. </li>
<li>Find the common rectangle containing the object's previous location and<br>
its new location. This can be calculated by passing UnionRect the object's<br>
bounding rectangle for both positions. Be sure the common rectangle uses<br>
coordinates local to the window. </li>
<li>Create the intermediate off-screen layer with the dimensions of the<br>
common rectangle. </li>
<li>Switch to the intermediate layer and transfer the area of the<br>
corresponding common rectangle of the background layer to the current layer.<br>
This will restore the area at which the object was last positioned. Rather than<br>
having to redraw the background for each frame, you simply replace the<br>
damaged area with the background image stored in memory. </li>
<li>Draw the moving object at its new location in the intermediate layer. If<br>
multiple objects are within the same bounding region of this layer, they<br>
should be drawn at this time as well. </li>
<li>Switch to the window layer and use CopyBits to transfer the contents of<br>
the intermediate layer to the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to create the entire animation<br>
sequence, repeat steps 3-7 until the animation is complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illustration<br>
below shows the process of creating one of the frames in the sequence. In this<br>
frame, the moving object is the sun, drawn on top of the background image of<br>
the mountains. </li>
</ol>
<p>
When moving multiple objects, you'll need to decide whether to handle the objects<br>
separately or in groups. In the case where objects are widely dispersed in the window,<br>
it would be more practical to create a separate intermediate layer for each object than<br>
to create one layer containing all the objects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since no changes are occurring in<br>
places between widely spread objects, unnecessary time and memory would be spent<br>
updating these areas.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/238.gif" width="293 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
However, if the objects are closely spaced, grouping the objects and creating one<br>
intermediate layer would make more sense. Since objects can overlap each other,<br>
creating separate off-screen worlds would not be too practical or easily accomplished.<br>
So when determining the number of intermediate off-screen layers, you'll want to<br>
first check where the objects are located in the window. 
</p>
<p>
The main advantage of using the intermediate layer is the performance improvement.<br>
As mentioned earlier, transferring large blocks of data at high pixel depths can be time<br>
consuming. As you can guess, the smaller the transfer image, the less time QuickDraw<br>
requires. Another advantage of using this layer is the ability to isolate the background<br>
image. Since all the drawing is taking place in the intermediate layer, there's no need<br>
to redraw the background image for each frame, which can be a real time saver for<br>
complex backgrounds. Though more memory is required with the addition of the<br>
intermediate layer, the performance gains can sometimes make the extra memory<br>
worth it. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, to fully optimize the animation performance, you'll want to be sure the data<br>
transfer from the off-screen layers is as fast as possible. Since you can influence the<br>
speed of CopyBits, here are a few points you'll want to keep in mind when creating and<br>
using off-screen layers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>For indexed GDevices, the same color table should be used for the window<br>
and the off-screen layers. Since no color mapping should be required when the<br>
source and destination share the same color table, less time is needed for the<br>
data transfer. </li>
<li>Be sure no nonrectangular clipping is involved in the CopyBits operation.<br>
Having to check which pixels should or shouldn't be clipped can really slow<br>
down the data transfer. </li>
<li>Use srcCopy as the transfer mode for CopyBits.  Any other mode takes<br>
extra time to perform the logical operations on the source and destination<br>
pixels. </li>
<li>Set the current port's foreground color to black and background color to<br>
white before calling CopyBits. This will ensure that no colorizing (which can<br>
be slow) takes place. </li>
<li>Make sure no dithering takes place. Unless you have your own rippin' fast<br>
method for dithering, try to stay away from it. If possible, prepare the images<br>
in the off-screen layers in such a way that dithering isn't needed. </li>
<li>Keep the same alignment of pixels for the source and destination pixMaps.<br>
Having to shift unaligned pixels can take time. </li>
<li>The source and destination rectangles should be the same size. Scaling<br>
requires extra work. </li>
</ul>
<p>
By following as many of these points as possible, you'll improve the performance that<br>
you'll get out of CopyBits and waste less time in the on-screen updates. 
</p>
<p>
<b>LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!</b><br>
I've presented several methods of animation; which method to use depends on your<br>
application. In fact, you may choose to use several methods or switch between methods<br>
under different system requirements. Say your application uses multiple layering for<br>
optimal animation; under low-memory conditions, you may want to switch to just one<br>
off-screen world to provide at least some type of off- screen animation. But if that<br>
isn't even an option, you may have to do all the animation on-screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an example<br>
that does exactly that, see DTS.Draw in the Sample Code folder on the<i>Developer CD</i><br>
<i>Series</i> disc. If sufficient memory is available to create the off-screen worlds, the<br>
application uses the multilayer method; otherwise, the application decides on the next<br>
best method based on the current available memory. 
</p>
<p>
This column has described different animation techniques, but the principle behind<br>
them is basically the same, even if the results don't show it. Given a set of slightly<br>
different images, all the methods involve stepping through the series of images, where<br>
each object in the image is erased before the next object in the series is displayed. 
</p>
<p>
Animation provides excellent visual effects, more fun for the programmer, and most<br>
important, an enhanced experience for the user. Now that you've got the basics of<br>
animation on the Macintosh, I hope you'll be inspired to animate your own<br>
applications!
