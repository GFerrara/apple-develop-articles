Dear Readers,
</p>
<p>
Time marches on, and with it, inevitably, comes change. I'll be telling you here about<br>
some recent changes in the world of Macintosh documentation and <i> develop</i> . We think<br>
they're changes for the better--but of course you, the developer, are the final judge.
</p>
<p>
First, the "bible," <i>Inside Macintosh</i> , is on its way out, starting with the imminent<br>
publication of <i> New Inside Macintosh</i> . I know only too well what your problems were<br>
with the first three IM volumes, which I slaved over for a good chunk of my life--not<br>
enough examples, not enough explanation of how the parts work together as a<br>
whole--and (till now) I've resisted the urge to defend myself here by telling you how<br>
time- and staff-restricted we were, how the software kept changing out from under<br>
us, and numerous other excuses. Volumes IV through VI sparked new complaints,<br>
primarily that the information on a specific topic was scattered over several volumes.<br>
All these problems have been addressed in <i>New Inside Macintosh</i> , which brings<br>
everything together in an organized and understandable way that should, once it's<br>
published in its entirety, have you happily discarding all your old volumes (except for<br>
you sentimentalists who will never part with your old "phone book" edition). The first<br>
NIM books are due to appear in bookstores in September, and the last books in the<br>
series should be available by May 1993. The electronic versions of these books will<br>
show up on the <i>Developer CD Series</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;disc as soon as they're ready. References to <i> Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;in <i>develop </i> will continue to point to the original IM volumes until next year<br>
when the transition to NIM is complete.
</p>
<p>
Tech Notes have also undergone a reincarnation, as you'll notice when you look at them<br>
on the CD. Our new Tech Note poobah, Neil Day, talks about this at the end of the<br>
Letters section, on page 6. The Notes are no longer numbered, but are now organized by<br>
subject, similar to the organization of<i>New Inside Macintosh</i> . As a result of this<br>
change, <i> develop</i> 's references to Tech Notes now refer to numbered Notes as things of<br>
the past (for example, "formerly #161").
</p>
<p>
Another change in this issue of <i> develop </i> is one we want to be sure you know is an<br>
aberration: There's no Print Hints column this time. It turns out that Luke Alexander<br>
committed one of the very printing crimes he wrote about in Issue 10, and he couldn't<br>
pay the bail. Well, actually, Luke was very busy preparing for his talk at the<br>
Worldwide Developers Conference while this issue was being written, and we had to let<br>
him off the hook. He promises he'll be back stronger than ever in Issue 12.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of the Worldwide Developers Conference, it was wonderful to meet so many of<br>
you there, hear your good words about <i> develop</i> , answer your questions, and set you<br>
straight on a few things. Many developers didn't know, for example, that <i> develop </i><br>
accepts articles from outside Apple (though we rigorously review them just like our<br>
own) and that they don't have to already be at the polished level of writing you're used<br>
to seeing in <i> develop </i> (we have editors who help with that). The overwhelming<br>
majority of Associates and Partners expressed their displeasure at no longer<br>
receiving<i>develop </i> in printed form in their monthly mailing (though some of them still<br>
hadn't realized this, because it usually takes a long time for <i> develop </i> to get to them<br>
anyway). Not all of them knew that they could subscribe to get printed <i> develop </i><br>
(through APDA, AppleLink DEV.SUBS, or thesubscription card in an actual printed<br>
issue). We'll keep trying to spread the word; meanwhile, please tell two friends.
</p>
<p>
On to the trivia . . . Issue 10's editorial asked: What character in <i> develop</i> 's body font<br>
is upside-down (not just one-time-only, but defined that way)? The answer is<br>
"8"--see? If it were a snowman, it would topple over.
</p>
<p>
Some of you wondered about my answer to this earlier trivia question: What word was<br>
used instead of "click" to describe the action of pressing a button on that first mouse?<br>
The answer was "bug," and I was asked whether the choice of that word was a joke, or<br>
what. I called Doug Engelbart himself to find out, and he said that in those days the<br>
cursor was called a "bug," so it became short for "to put the bug somewhere by<br>
pressing this button." It had nothing to do with the meaning of "bug" as a problem in a<br>
program. As to why "bug" was used to refer to the cursor, he didn't know the history of<br>
that. So I guess--unless one of you can shed some light on this--the bug stops there.

<b>CAROLINE ROSE </b>(AppleLink: CROSE) first interviewed at Apple in 1982, when she<br>
was shown a Macintosh with balls bouncing all over its screen. Having been raised on<br>
computers as card sorters and number crunchers, she thought this was pretty<br>
exciting, and signed up to write its technical documentation. Her love affair with the<br>
Macintosh suffered a blow when she left in 1986 to join NeXT, but she came back after<br>
five years away, and all was forgiven. Caroline recently learned from a bio in an early<br>
issue of <i> develop </i> that 8/8/88 was considered a very lucky day by the Chinese, and she<br>
ponders the significance of having missed that day entirely due to crossing the<br>
international date line. She loves to travel, whether in planes, trains, and<br>
automobiles, on foot, or simply back and forth in a swimming pool. *
