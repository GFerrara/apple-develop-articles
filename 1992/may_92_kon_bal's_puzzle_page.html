<i>don't get a high score, at least you'll learn interesting Macintosh trivia.</i>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;During the development of QuickTime, a number of interesting bugs reared their ugly<br>
heads. Try to figure out this one before KON does.
</p>
<p>
<b>120</b> BAL Here's the problem: When you play a movie on a Macintosh IIfx the machine<br>
hangs after about six hours. If you turn off the sound, or try it on any Macintosh other<br>
than an fx, it doesn't hang.
</p>
<p>
KON How does it hang? Is the Macintosh locked up?
</p>
<p>
<b>115</b> BAL Well, the movies aren't playing. They just all freeze about halfway through.<br>
Menus still work, though. You can even switch to the Finder and click between windows<br>
and move icons around, but when you launch an application or open a folder, the Finder<br>
draws one of the zoom rectangles and then hangs.
</p>
<p>
KON Like a time bomb. Can you get into MacsBug?
</p>
<p>
<b>110</b> BAL Yeah.
</p>
<p>
KON Whew. For a second I thought this was going to be really tough. You've got<br>
MacsBug, so what's the problem?
</p>
<p>
BAL I don't know, you tell me.
</p>
<p>
KON How do movies get time? SystemTask or something?
</p>
<p>
<b>105</b> BAL No, you have to call MoviesTask.
</p>
<p>
KON Figures. So I set a break on MoviesTask; is it getting called?
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;100</b> BAL Nope.
</p>
<p>
KON The application is supposed to call it?
</p>
<p>
<b>95</b> BAL Yep.
</p>
<p>
KON So is WaitNextEvent getting called?
</p>
<p>
<b>90</b> BAL Nope.
</p>
<p>
KON But menus work???
</p>
<p>
<b>85</b> BAL Yep.
</p>
<p>
KON WaitNextEvent is being called with a bogus sleep time. I set a breakpoint on it,<br>
pull down a menu, and see what the sleep time parameter is.
</p>
<p>
<b>80</b> BAL Now you're thinking, Kon! But no. The sleep time is 1, just as it's supposed to<br>
be.
</p>
<p>
KON Hmmm. So I trace 50 times and see where I'm spinning.
</p>
<p>
<b>75</b> BAL There's a bunch of stuff going on; it's not just some simple loop.
</p>
<p>
KON So I record A-traps.
</p>
<p>
<b>70</b> BAL There are three traps getting called: ABF7 from inside MF, A0DD<br>
(PPCToolbox) from a big block in the system heap that's not QuickTime, and A030<br>
(EventAvail) from a 'scod' resource that's different from the block calling ABF7.
</p>
<p>
KON There are no null events coming through to the application, so MoviesTask never<br>
gets called. The sleep time must never be expiring. Are ticks running?
</p>
<p>
BAL How do you figure that out?
</p>
<p>
KON I DM ticks, continue executing, and then DM ticks again.
</p>
<p>
<b>65</b> BAL Ticks doesn't change.
</p>
<p>
KON It's updated by some hardware mechanism at interrupt time, right?
</p>
<p>
BAL Sure, a hardware <i>mechanism</i> . Is that what they teach you at Caltech?
</p>
<p>
KON OK, OK. There's a heartbeat task that generates a level-1 interrupt that updates<br>
ticks, right?
</p>
<p>
<b>60</b> BAL Yeah.
</p>
<p>
KON So is the level-1 interrupt happening?
</p>
<p>
BAL How do you check that?
</p>
<p>
KON I know from reading this cool <i>develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;column that the level-1 interrupt vector is<br>
at location $64, so I set a break there and see if it's firing.
</p>
<p>
<b>55</b> BAL Wait a second. That's the way ticks are updated on every Macintosh except the<br>
fx. This problem happens only on an fx.
</p>
<p>
KON Why is the fx different?
</p>
<p>
<b>50</b> BAL The guy that designed the hardware assumed that the heartbeat task--and thus<br>
ticks-- was supposed to happen every 60th of a second. Unfortunately it's supposed to<br>
be every 60.14th of a second or something, so Gary Davidian fixed it by installing a<br>
Time Manager task that updates ticks. The extended Time Manager, found in System<br>
6.0.4 and later, adds a drift-free mode for Time Manager callbacks. This allows for<br>
accurate scheduling of periodic events without long-term drift. With the extended<br>
Time Manager, the next callback is scheduled with respect to when the current<br>
callback should have fired, rather than the current time. So as of System 6.0.4 there<br>
are two types of Time Manager tasks: the regular ones and the drift-free ones. Ticks<br>
are updated via a drift-free task, so they advance accurately over time.
</p>
<p>
KON Hmmm. So is the Time Manager task that updates ticks getting called?
</p>
<p>
<b>45</b> BAL Obviously not; ticks aren't changing.
</p>
<p>
KON How are the tasks in the queue organized?
</p>
<p>
<b>40</b> BAL They're kept in the order that they fire in. 
</p>
<p>
KON So where is the ticks task in the queue?
</p>
<p>
<b>35</b> BAL Well, it's not the first one, and the first one is scheduled for sometime<br>
tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
KON Fine. I leave and come back tomorrow. Does my movie start playing?
</p>
<p>
<b>30</b> BAL It could be. But we're shipping before then.
</p>
<p>
KON So the first element is getting messed up and never completes. Then none of the<br>
other items in the queue get executed because they're all deltas off the first element<br>
and the movies hang.
</p>
<p>
<b>25</b> BAL Now we're getting somewhere.
</p>
<p>
KON So how is that first element getting confused?
</p>
<p>
BAL Whose problem is this?
</p>
<p>
KON OK. Who owns the first item?
</p>
<p>
BAL How do you figure that out?
</p>
<p>
KON I do an IL to see what traps it's calling. I see where it is in the heap. I set a<br>
breakpoint on it, force it to fire, and see what it does.
</p>
<p>
<b>20</b> BAL You're knee deep in spaghetti. You could probably figure it out this way but<br>
it's pretty nasty.
</p>
<p>
KON OK. I break on InsTime to see who installs it. I break on PrimeTime to see who<br>
starts it up. I figure out whether it's using InsTime or InsXTime.
</p>
<p>
<b>15</b> BAL The PrimeTime comes from an 'snth' resource. It was installed with InsXTime.
</p>
<p>
KON Aha! The Sound Manager. That's why it works when the sound is turned off.
</p>
<p>
BAL They don't pay you enough, Kon.
</p>
<p>
KON So how does this element get updated in the queue? Don't Time Manager tasks call<br>
PrimeTime to reschedule themselves?
</p>
<p>
<b>10</b> BAL Yeah.
</p>
<p>
KON So is someone calling PrimeTime on the Sound Manager task with a bogus value?
</p>
<p>
<b>5</b> BAL Not really. It always calls PrimeTime with a value of 0, indicating that it wants<br>
to be called right away. The Sound Manager does this since it's not reentrant. By<br>
scheduling a task, it knows it won't be called until it's finished servicing the current<br>
interrupt, avoiding reentrancy problems.
</p>
<p>
KON I'm sure everyone that's reading this has figured it out by now. I know I have.
</p>
<p>
BAL You're bluffing again, Kon.
</p>
<p>
KON It's easy. Since the drift-free Time Manager schedules tasks based on when they<br>
should occur, and since this sound task is using a count of 0 when calling PrimeTime,<br>
its backlog gets bigger and bigger. So each PrimeTime call schedules an event that<br>
should have occurred further and further in the past. The task is executed<br>
immediately, of course, but the backlog builds. It always puts this element at the head<br>
of the queue, but eventually it overflows the long that contains the backlog, and the<br>
scheduling time becomes incredibly large. There are about 4 billion microseconds in a<br>
long, which is about an hour. The Time Manager counts in units that are about 20<br>
microseconds, so it would take about 20 hours to overflow. Take away a bit for signed<br>
math and another because it's calculating scheduling times, and I would guess it should<br>
hang about once every 5 hours. It must have taken forever to find that one.
</p>
<p>
BAL Yeah, it was a drag. We fixed it before we shipped QuickTime, of course. But it's<br>
just the kind of thing that makes scheduling software projects so hard.
</p>
<p>
KON Nasty.
</p>
<p>
BAL Yeah.
</p>
<p>
<b>KONSTANTIN OTHMER AND BRUCE LEAK</b> have been puzzling about reality, life,<br>
the universe, and even computers for a long time. Since the great success of their<br>
Graphics '90 World Tour, which included peace-keeping, hostage-freeing, and<br>
wall-smashing, they settled down, shipped a few QuickDraw packages, and cleaned out<br>
their closets. Then came the coup: da division of da Union. Konstantin got QuickDraw,<br>
200 rubles, and a guaranteed spot at the front of the bread line. Official party line on<br>
Bruce: "vacationing in the Crimea." Bruce was actually working on the first<br>
QuickDraw spinoff. To provide a seamless upgrade path, and to leverage off of brand<br>
awareness, he decided to call this project QuickTime. *
