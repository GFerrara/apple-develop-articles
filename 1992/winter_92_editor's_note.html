<p>
&nbsp;Dear Readers,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Let's talk about <i>develop</i>: what it is, what it might be, what it can do for you, and what<br>
you can do for it. This journal exists to meet your needs, so I hope you'll help us out by<br>
reading on and giving us your two cents (if not your articles).
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Originally, <i>develop </i> was thought of as "heavily commented code": along with the<br>
accompanying CD, it was meant as a vehicle for providing well-explained code that<br>
you, the developer, could plug into your application with the confidence that it would<br>
be compatible with future system software. To ensure compatibility, articles and code<br>
were written primarily by Apple engineers and heavily reviewed by other engineers<br>
at Apple.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;But other types of articles have been submitted, and some have made it into print.<br>
Most notable was the ground-breaking Threads article in Issue 6, the first article for<br>
which source code was not provided. This lack of source code did not go unnoticed by<br>
our readers, yet the overall response to the Threads package was extremely favorable.<br>
So we've moved from <i> always </i> providing source code to providing it <i>if at all possible</i> .<br>
We still make every effort, however, to give you something that won't break in future<br>
systems.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Recently we've had some requests to publish articles that describe algorithms or<br>
ideas, not code. Our current feeling is that as long as an article can help you create good<br>
Apple products, we'll consider publishing it. Please let us know what you'd like to see.<br>
There are some Apple engineers who are willing to contribute to <i> develop </i> but would<br>
like to know just what developers want to see. We get a lot of input from Developer<br>
Technical Support about what you seem to need the most help with--but let us at<br>
<i>develop </i> know directly, and we can try to make it happen faster.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Regarding who writes the articles: we feel that as long as the code is reviewed by<br>
Apple engineers, there's no need to rely solely on people at Apple for contributions.<br>
We'd like to encourage all of you to think about what you'd like to share with your<br>
fellow developers--something that would help them and also give you a way to<br>
showcase and release your code in a way that wouldn't otherwise be possible. We offer<br>
something those <i> other </i> journals don't: not only review by Apple engineers and the<br>
assurance of future compatibility, but also an editorial process that will make your<br>
prose shine so brilliantly you'll need to wear shades. We'll assign an editor who will<br>
help turn your raw material into a polished piece--or tread lightly on it if that's all<br>
you need. We'll give your article that professional look and feel without killing the<br>
humor. So, if you're willing, please send me your ideas or outlines, and we'll take it<br>
from there.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Back to the subject of your opinions about <i> develop</i> : Many of you who are Apple<br>
Associates and Partners have by now been formally surveyed on how you rate various<br>
support-related materials, of which <i>develop </i> is only one shining example. We'd also<br>
like to hear from the rest of you, however informally. I can't overemphasize how<br>
important your opinions are and how much they'll affect<i> develop</i> 's future. So please,<br>
express yourself! Tell us what's good or bad about this journal's content, format,<br>
delivery, or anything else. We're all ears.Issue 8 ended with this trivia question: What<br>
word was used instead of "click" to describe the action of pressing a button on that first<br>
mouse? The answer, which none of you have gotten as of this writing, is "bug." Maybe<br>
you'll do better on this next one: The original hardcover <i> Inside Macintosh</i> Volumes<br>
I-III had a running pattern of Macintosh computers across its endpapers (those heavy<br>
sheets at the very beginning and end of hardcover books). What broke this pattern, and<br>
why?

<p>
<b>CAROLINE ROSE</b> (AppleLink: CROSE) has been writing computer documentation ever<br>
since Steve Jobs was barely a teen. When his company moved in down the block from<br>
where she worked as a writer and then a programmer, Caroline took no notice--until<br>
they asked if she wanted to write what even then was known as <i> Inside Macintosh</i> .<br>
Around the time she completed that three-volume tome, Steve left Apple to form NeXT,<br>
and Caroline signed on to launch NeXT's Publications group. A year ago she returned to<br>
Apple to take on the fun-filled job of being&nbsp;&nbsp;develop's editor in chief. For fun outside of<br>
work, Caroline dances up a storm, listens to music, plays with her cat and other<br>
friends, treks through the wilderness (in boots or on skis), swims like a maniac,<br>
reads fiction (not sci-fi!), studies Italian, does Tai Chi, and never stops exploring new<br>
ways to have fun.*
