<i>When you want to display an image that contains more color information than the</i><br>
<i>display device is capable of rendering, how do you pick the best colors to use? The</i><br>
<i>Picture Utilities Package, new in System 7, provides two methods, which we describe</i><br>
<i>here. You also have the option of developing your own color selection algorithm. This</i><br>
<i>article and the accompanying code on the Developer CD Series disc will get you started.</i>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
It's tricky to display an image when the number of colors used in the source exceeds<br>
the number of colors available on the device. On an indexed device (256 or fewer<br>
colors), an application can choose, via the Palette Manager, which colors to use. But<br>
how will it know which colors are the best ones to choose, given a particular image?
</p>
<p>
To avoid this issue altogether, your application can simply draw the image and let<br>
QuickDraw use its default color palettes to make the choice. Because these palettes<br>
contain a well-dispersed set of colors, most images look pretty good. However, in the<br>
case of an image that uses an unbalanced set of colors, such as an underwater scene<br>
with many subtle shades of blue, relying on the default palette will not produce a<br>
good-looking result. In this case, you<i>must</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;tackle the issue of how to choose the<br>
optimal palette. That's when the new Picture Utilities Package can help. 
</p>
<p>
Picture Utilities provides two methods--the popular method and the median<br>
method--for determining the best colors. This article describes these two methods. In<br>
addition, it describes a third method--the octree method--which, in addition to being<br>
useful in itself, makes a convenient starting point for you to develop your own<br>
algorithm for choosing the optimal color palette. 
</p>
<h2>DECIDING WHICH METHOD TO USE</h2>
<p>
It would be nice if one method of selecting colors worked best for all types of images.<br>
But the truth is that the methods provided in Picture Utilities work best for some<br>
types of images (such as those whose colors are all clustered in one small portion of<br>
the RGB cube), while QuickDraw's standard method works best for other types.<br>
Therefore, it's always important to give the user a choice of which Picture Utilities<br>
color-picking method to use and whether to use one of these at all. 
</p>
<p>
The three methods we discuss here differ in how they approximate the ideal color set.<br>
The popular method bases its choices on a frequency count of colors used in the image,<br>
returning the most frequently used colors. Both the median and octree methods are<br>
algorithms that describe occupancy in a space. In this case, the space is the color cube<br>
with axes of red, green, and blue, and the occupants are the colors in the image. These<br>
algorithms differ in the way they divide up the space in order to return the correct<br>
number of colors. The median algorithm starts with one giant box covering the entire<br>
cube and splits it into successively smaller boxes; the octree algorithm starts with<br>
lots of tiny boxes and joins them into larger ones. Both methods return the weighted<br>
average of each of the boxes as the final set of colors. 
</p>
<p>
The most appropriate method for your particular use depends on factors such as the<br>
type of image you want to display (real world, computer-generated, graphic, and so<br>
on), image content (perhaps the colors of items in the foreground are more important<br>
than the colors of items in the background), or even how the image will be displayed<br>
(halftoned or dithered, for example). For instance, none of these methods take<br>
dithering into account, although since we provide you with the source code, you could<br>
modify the octree method to do so.
</p>
<p>
The speed of each method also varies, with the popular method being fastest, the<br>
median method slower, and the octree method slowest, since in the latter there are<br>
more calculations involved for each color chosen. Also, the code that we supply for the<br>
octree method is intended to be easy to understand rather than blazingly fast. In fact,<br>
the current code is slower than the popular method by a factor of four, but with a little<br>
work this could probably be improved to be only twice as slow. 
</p>
<p>
Another basic consideration is whether you want to represent the majority of colors in<br>
the image or the range of colors present. For example, if you could select only two<br>
colors to represent an image that contains several different shades of red and one blue<br>
dot, you would have to decide whether to pick two reds in an attempt to represent the<br>
majority of colors in the image, or one red and one blue to represent the range of<br>
colors the image contains. The popular method would do the former, while the median<br>
method would do the latter.
</p>
<p>
In general, the best method to use for an image that has a fairly well dispersed set of<br>
colors is QuickDraw's default palette. The popular method is useful when the source<br>
image contains only a few more colors than are available on the display device. For<br>
example, if you want to display a 32-bit image that uses only 200 distinct colors on<br>
an 8-bit device, the popular method is the best choice for speed and accuracy. While<br>
this case is trivial, using the popular method does guarantee that the needed colors will<br>
be made available, a claim that can't be made for the default palette. The median and<br>
octree methods generally give the best results for images where small patches of a<br>
distinctly different color must be preserved at the cost of blending together large<br>
patches of similar colors.
</p>
<p>
Experience will give you a better feel for the strengths and weaknesses of each of these<br>
methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, for purposes of comparison, Figure 1 shows screen snapshots of<br>
a 32-bit image as it originally appeared, using QuickDraw's default 16-color palette,<br>
using 16 popular colors, using 16 median colors, and using 16 octree colors. The<br>
original image has 77 different colors (to a resolution of five bits per color<br>
component). A test program on the<i>Developer CD Series</i> disc enables you to experiment<br>
with this image (or others) and to take a look at the code used to generate the various<br>
versions. 
</p>
<p>
Notice in the original image that the colors marking the minutes follow a smooth<br>
progression from cyan on the far left to dark blue at the top to magenta on the right to<br>
purple on the bottom and then to dark red just before the cyan. Also notice the subtle<br>
color blending where the translucent minute and second hands intersect the underlying<br>
clock. When the standard 16-color palette is used, the soft colors of the minute<br>
markers change into much brighter, harder colors, and the smooth transitions are<br>
replaced by sudden transitions. The colors of the background and the face of the clock<br>
have changed. Furthermore, the subtle difference in color between the background and<br>
the background of the date (January 24) is lost.
</p>
<p>
The popular method preserves the colors of the largest color areas: the background,<br>
the clock face, the background of the date, the color of the minute and hour hands, and<br>
the lettering. The colors of the minute markers remain soft, but lose their shading<br>
resolution; for example, the cyan is replaced by a darker blue. Because it preserves<br>
the range of colors, the median method performs somewhat better on the minute<br>
markers than the previous two methods, but the clock face turns to black and the green<br>
hand becomes washed out. Although the image's appearance may not be ideal because<br>
many of the large areas are wrong, areas of the image that depend on the color ranges <br>
(which in this image just happen to occupy small areas) are reproduced more<br>
accurately. When the octree method is used, the result is similar to that of the median<br>
method, except the green hour hand is completely lost. This is due to the simple tree<br>
reduction algorithm we use; if the tree reduction improvements that we suggest at the<br>
end of the article were implemented, the hour hand most likely would be preserved,<br>
although its shade of green might change (much as happened with the median method). <br>
The octree performed better than the median in preserving the color of the text and the<br>
background of the date.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;One conclusion from these images is that there is not a single best color-picking<br>
algorithm, even for a particular picture. For this image, we would be inclined to use<br>
the popular method, since we don't care too much about the subtle shading effects on<br>
the minute markers. However, an artist might be much more concerned with the<br>
subtle shading effects and actually not care if the face of the clock went to a completely<br>
different but still solid shade. In this case, the artist would probably pick the median<br>
or octree method. This is why applications that provide color optimization should allow<br>
the user to choose between the various available methods.

<b>&nbsp;Figure 1</b> An Image Displayed Using Four Different Color-Picking Methods
</p>
<p>
There is also a "system" method built into the Picture Utilities Package that tries to<br>
select the best general method available. Currently, the popular method is selected if<br>
the number of requested colors is 75% or greater of the total number of distinct<br>
colors in the image (to a resolution of five bits per color component); otherwise the<br>
median method is selected. The operation of this system method is almost certain to<br>
change in the future. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Now that you have some idea of how the available color-picking methods compare, we<br>
turn to details of how the popular, median, and octree methods work. 
</p>
<h2>HOW THE POPULAR METHOD WORKS</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;The popular method of color selection is the easiest to understand and in general<br>
produces the least satisfactory results. This method chooses colors based on how<br>
frequently they're used in the image.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation is performed by creating a<br>
histogram (a frequency count of each color) and then returning the colors that occur<br>
most often (as shown in Figure 2), up to the specified number of colors. If the image<br>
contains more than 256 different colors or if any of the source items are 32-bit<br>
pixMaps, Picture Utilities only maintains color information to a resolution of five bits<br>
per color component. Thus, colors must differ in the highest five bits of any of the<br>
three color components (red, green, and blue) to be considered distinct. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/177.gif" width="404 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2</b> Picking Four Colors Using the Popular Method
</p>
<p>
In Figure 2, the x-axis represents each possible RGB color to a resolution of five bits<br>
per component.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These colors range from 0-0-0 (0 red, 0 green, 0 blue) to<br>
32-32-32 (32 red, 32 green, 32 blue) in the high five bits of the red-green-blue<br>
color components, for a total of 215 or around 32,000 entries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The y-axis measures<br>
the frequency of each of the colors, up to a maximum of 32,767 occurrences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus,<br>
this table contains 215 entries of one word each and occupies 64K of memory. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;For custom methods, Picture Utilities can generate this histogram of color usage for<br>
you. If your custom method wants this, its initialization subroutine must return the<br>
value ColorBankIs555 for the color bank parameter. The octree method described later<br>
in this article does not use a histogram.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, it uses its own custom color bank and<br>
thus returns ColorBankIsCustom as its color bank parameter. 
</p>
<h2>HOW THE MEDIAN METHOD WORKS</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;The median method is an iterative algorithm that views the colors in an image as if<br>
they were arranged in a cube with axes representing the red, green, and blue<br>
components. It starts by generating a histogram of the source colors, just as the<br>
popular method does. However, while the popular method is pretty much done after<br>
this, the median method's real work has only just begun. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The first real step is to determine the smallest RGB cube that will hold all the colors<br>
in the image.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finding the median color along the longest color axis, it then puts<br>
all the colors on one side of that color into one box and the remaining colors into<br>
another box. It continues this measuring and splitting process&nbsp;&nbsp;until the colors have<br>
been assigned to as many boxes as colors requested. Then the weighted average color of<br>
each of the boxes is returned as the color set to use. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Since the algorithm is much easier to visualize in two dimensions, we'll illustrate<br>
how it works in the red-green plane only. Extending the algorithm to three dimensions<br>
is straightforward. In Figure 3, eight colors are present in the red-green color plane<br>
(the blue component is taken as 0 for all colors).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this simplified example, each<br>
color occurs only once. In the general case, if a color occurs more than once, that color<br>
is weighted accordingly in the final step when the colors in each box are averaged. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The first division is along the green axis since the difference between the most green<br>
and the least green color is slightly larger than the difference between the most red<br>
and the least red color. This division results in the two boxes shown in step 2 of Figure<br>
3. The largest difference in colors along one axis is now along the red axis of the top<br>
box. Thus, this box is divided into two along the red axis, leaving us with three boxes<br>
as shown in step 3. This time the largest difference is in the red axis of the bottom<br>
box, so this box is divided along the median, producing the result shown in step 4. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/178.gif" width="569 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3</b> Picking Four Colors Using the Median Method
</p>
<p>
We now have four boxes, and since the best four colors were requested in this<br>
example, we're done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colors returned are the weighted averages of the colors in<br>
each of the boxes, as shown. 
</p>
<h2>HOW THE OCTREE METHOD WORKS</h2>
<p>
The octree method, like the median method, is an iterative algorithm that describes<br>
how the colors in an image are arranged in an RGB cube. Like the median method, the<br>
octree method groups the colors in an image together into the same number of boxes as<br>
colors requested and then returns weighted averages from these boxes, but the way<br>
these boxes are constructed differs substantially between the two methods. While the<br>
popular and median methods process data that's stored in a histogram, the octree<br>
method does its color accounting via a tree. This means that rather than truncating<br>
colors to 5-5-5 from the get-go, the method maintains the full 8-8-8 color<br>
throughout the process. 
</p>
<p>
An octree is similar to a binary tree, except that instead of having two branches at<br>
each node, it has eight. An octree corresponds to a cube with axes representing the red,<br>
green, and blue components of an image. At each level of the tree, the colors are placed<br>
in the branch of the tree indicated by the corresponding bits of the red, green, and blue<br>
components. For instance, say a color consists of one bit of red, one bit of blue, and one<br>
bit of green. The 0-0-0 (red-green-blue) color will be the first entry in the node,<br>
the 0-0-1 color will be the second entry in the node, and the 1-1-1 color will be the<br>
eighth entry in the node. Astute readers will notice that to determine which entry a<br>
color should be, we simply use the color value itself as a zero-based index into the<br>
node. 
</p>
<p>
Our octree must deal with eight bits of red, green, and blue for each color, but this is<br>
an easy extension of the previous case. To handle multiple bits of color information,<br>
the code extracts the highest bit of each of the red, green, and blue components of the<br>
color and uses this as an index into the level-0 node to find the level-1 node. Then the<br>
next highest bit of each component is extracted and used as an index into this level-1<br>
node to find the level-2 node. This process continues down to the lowest bit, which is<br>
used as an index into the level-7 node to find the color record (a level-8 leaf). 
</p>
<p>
The actual color selection details of the octree method are much easier to understand in<br>
two dimensions, just as the core of the median method was. In two dimensions we're<br>
working with a quadtree instead of an octree. A quadtree has four branches at each<br>
node, as illustrated in Figure 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note that below level 1 only one branch per node is<br>
followed to a deeper level, for the sake of simplifying the drawing. In reality, each<br>
node sprouts four branches, each of which in turn sprouts four more, and so on to the<br>
deepest level.) Colors are inserted into the quadtree much as they would be in an<br>
octree, except that the blue component is missing. For instance, the 0-0 (red-green)<br>
color is the first entry in the node, the 0-1 color is the second entry, and the 1-1<br>
color is the fourth entry. Thus, the two-dimensional color value can still be used as a<br>
zero-based index into the node. 
</p>
<p>
We think of this quadtree as corresponding to a coordinate plane formed by two color<br>
axes; each branch then corresponds to a quadrant of the space covered by the parent<br>
node. For instance, if a quadtree is being used to represent the red-green plane of an<br>
RGB cube with each axis ranging from 0 to 8, the four level-1 nodes represent the<br>
four quadrants of this plane defined by (red 0-4, green 0- 4), (red 4-8, green<br>
0-4), (red 0-4, green 4-8), and (red 4-8, green 4-8). The level-2 nodes of the<br>
(red 0-4, green 0-4) quadrant represent the four quarters of this particular<br>
quadrant, and so on down to the deepest level. Of course, in the case of the octree (the<br>
structure that our algorithm actually uses), the eight branches contained by a node<br>
correspond to the eight subcubes of the space represented by the entire node. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/179.gif" width="470 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 4</b> A Five-Level Quadtree
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The octree algorithm first adds colors (leaves) to the tree until there is one more<br>
color (leaf) than requested. Then the tree is reduced so that there are no more leaves<br>
than colors requested. The reduction process starts on the deepest level and attempts to<br>
find two or more leaves that have the same parent. If this condition is not met on the<br>
deepest level, the search continues up to the next level until multiple leaves with the<br>
same parent are found. These leaves are then reduced to the parent node. The process<br>
continues until the tree contains no more than the number of colors (leaves) requested<br>
and no more colors remain to be added. The final color for each leaf in the tree is<br>
determined by calculating a weighted average of all the colors reduced to that leaf. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;One major difference that distinguishes our octree implementation from the median or<br>
popular method is the way that colors are recorded. The octree method calculates the<br>
set of best colors (reduces nodes) as the source colors are being added to the tree,<br>
instead of counting and storing all the colors before beginning to pare them down. This<br>
is not an inherent limitation of octrees in general; we simply chose this<br>
implementation to reduce our memory requirements and to make these requirements<br>
independent of the complexity of the image. The disadvantage of this choice is that the<br>
octree method must make decisions on which colors to throw out based on incomplete<br>
information. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Another interesting difference is that the octree algorithm can actually return fewer<br>
colors than requested, instead of always returning the exact number. Theoretically,<br>
this can reduce the accuracy of the returned color set, since there are fewer colors to<br>
represent the full range and detail of the picture. However, we have found that most<br>
images do return either the full number of colors requested or only one or two fewer. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;For purposes of comparison, we'll discuss how the octree method picks the best four<br>
colors in a color plane when given the same eight colors as used in the example for the<br>
median method. The process is illustrated in Figure 5. Note that the quadtree is<br>
represented there by a 16 x 16 grid; each position in the grid corresponds to one of<br>
the leaves on the fifth level of the quadtree shown in Figure 4. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/180.gif" width="578 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 5</b> Picking Four Colors Using the Octree Method
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;In the grid, each color initially occupies its own tiny box. The color selection process<br>
translates into collecting the grid squares into bigger and bigger boxes until more than<br>
one color falls into a single box. We start with five colors in step 1, one more color<br>
than requested. The reduction from step 1 to step 2 in the figure involves reducing a<br>
node at the fourth level of the quadtree, creating a 4 x 4 box containing two colors. Had<br>
a fifth-level node containing two colors been found, the new box would be 2 x 2 rather<br>
than 4 x 4. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;In step 3, another color is added and since it doesn't fall into an existing subdivision,<br>
the tree is reduced again. This time an 8 x 8 box, as shown in step 4, is formed. Step 5<br>
adds another color, but since it falls in the 8 x 8 box, no further reduction is<br>
necessary. Step 6 adds the eighth and last color.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't fall into an existing node, so<br>
a reduction is done and another 8 x 8 box is formed. As there are no more colors in the<br>
image, the weighted average of the colors in each of the boxes is returned and we're<br>
done. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Extending this algorithm to work in three dimensions rather than two is easy. The<br>
details of the implementation are in the source code, which can be found on<br>
the<i>Developer CD Series</i> disc. Once you've studied this source code you may want to<br>
write your own completely different color selection algorithm; Chapter 18 of<i>Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i> Volume VI fully describes how to do this.
</p>
<h2>ADDITIONAL APPLICATION CODE</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;In addition to the code for the octree algorithm itself, we've supplied code on the CD<br>
for a crude test application that demonstrates how to apply both the popular and<br>
median methods as well as the octree method to a picture contained in a PICT file. The<br>
test application has a very simple user interface that allows you to open any PICT file<br>
and see what it looks like using the set of colors returned by the popular, median, and<br>
octree algorithms, as well as the standard system color table. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The source code for this application shows how to associate the color information that<br>
Picture Utilities returns with windows, and it also contains several useful routines<br>
for managing pictures stored on disk. These routines allow you to treat "disk pictures"<br>
as objects that can easily be passed around to various routines, drawn, profiled (using<br>
Picture Utilities), and even cached in memory if there's space to do so. Take a look at<br>
the actual source for the details on all this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our test application does not attempt to<br>
demonstrate how to use Picture Utilities to profile multiple pictures and pixMaps;<br>
see<i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume VI for a complete explanation of how to do this. 
</p>
<h2>ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT</h2>
<p>
From the algorithms, it seems as though the median and octree methods should produce<br>
an excellent set of colors with which to display any image. Unfortunately, both<br>
algorithms fall somewhat short of this goal, especially with images that have a fairly<br>
well dispersed set of colors. 
</p>
<p>
We can think of several areas where both could be improved. First, both algorithms<br>
weigh the red, green, and blue axes equally. As it turns out, the eye does the best job of<br>
perceiving green and a relatively poorer job of perceiving blue. Perhaps different<br>
weights could be assigned to the axes to compensate for this quirk of human perception.<br>
An advanced color selection method could take into account the fact that even within one<br>
color axis, the eye does not perceive the color (intensity and saturation) uniformly,<br>
and could compensate for variation in the gamma function of each monitor as well. 
</p>
<p>
Second, in both methods the colors in the final boxes are averaged. While this produces<br>
the color that most accurately represents each box, it necessarily leaves some colors<br>
unreachable, even by dithering. A better choice of color might be the corner of the<br>
final box that's farthest away from the center of the RGB cube. This would assure that<br>
all the colors in the image would be within the cube of colors defined by the palette<br>
used to represent the image. 
</p>
<p>
The median method isn't a realistic candidate for improvement since it's built into the<br>
Picture Utilities Package. On the other hand, we're providing you with the full source<br>
code for the octree method, so you're free to modify it. Since that's the case, we'll<br>
suggest a few other things that could be improved. 
</p>
<p>
The most important part of the octree method is determining which nodes in the tree to<br>
reduce when the maximum number of colors has been reached. The algorithm we use in<br>
our sample code is much too simple; we simply scan through all the nodes at the<br>
deepest level looking for one that has two or more colors hanging off it. Then if we don't<br>
find any such nodes at the deepest level, we move up a level and look for ones that have<br>
two or more nodes hanging off them. 
</p>
<p>
One better approach would be to reduce nodes that have the most discrete colors<br>
hanging off them; this would tend to blend similar shades into a single color, while<br>
preserving "fringe" colors. Another approach would be to reduce the nodes that have<br>
the most occurrences of colors hanging off them so that small splashes of color would<br>
not lose their distinctness.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if it's important to preserve subtle shades in the main areas of the picture<br>
and it's OK for fringe colors to be drastically modified, the previously mentioned<br>
improvements could be reversed to always reduce the nodes with the fewest discrete<br>
colors or the nodes with the fewest occurrences. A good general algorithm would<br>
probably try to incorporate both of these effects by having an occurrence threshold;<br>
colors that occur fewer than a certain number of times would be considered noise and<br>
either thrown out completely or reduced before more significant colors. In the case of<br>
colors that occur more than the threshold number of times, the algorithm could look<br>
for nodes with the most colors, since if a patch of fringe color is large enough to be<br>
noticeable, it should probably be preserved. 
</p>
<p>
To properly implement these improvements, the octree method would probably need to<br>
be modified to collect all the colors before reducing any of them, to ensure accurate<br>
occurrence counts. Also, as we've mentioned before, currently our method can return<br>
fewer colors than were actually requested.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the code were modified to collect all the<br>
colors first, it would be relatively easy to ensure that the octree is never reduced<br>
below the requested number of colors. While overall this effect would probably be<br>
small compared to the benefit of a smarter reduction algorithm, it would substantially<br>
improve the quality of the rare images that degenerate under the current<br>
implementation and return many fewer colors than requested. 
</p>
<p>
Other general improvements that could be made to the octree sample provided on the<br>
CD are dynamic memory management and overflow checking. We presently allocate all<br>
the memory that we'll need for the maximum size octree up front. While this is easy to<br>
do, it wastes space and prevents the code from being robust enough to support storing<br>
all the colors in the image before reducing any nodes. We also don't check for overflows<br>
when accumulating the average color represented by the node. Enhancements like this<br>
are very important if a piece of software is going to be more than just a sample. For<br>
example, both the built-in Picture Utilities methods do check for overflows and do<br>
some dynamic memory allocation.

<h2>HACK ON</h2>
<p>
This article has discussed techniques for picking the best colors for displaying an<br>
image that contains more color information than the display device is capable of<br>
rendering. While there is no one best algorithm for selecting colors in every case,<br>
experience will show you which of the three simple methods we've discussed is most<br>
appropriate in each case. With your new understanding of the popular and median<br>
methods offered by the Picture Utilities Package and with the source code sample for<br>
the octree method, you should find it easy to generate your own custom color selection<br>
algorithm.

<b>DAVE ("KNOW") GOOD </b>admits to never having graduated from grade school, high<br>
school, or college, though he's attended all three. Still, this didn't keep him from<br>
learning to program the Macintosh, and he's been employed by Apple for four years,<br>
working on things as varied as System Utilities 3.1 for the Apple IIc, TextEdit for the<br>
II GS, and Picture Utilities (and other graphics-oriented work) for the Macintosh.<br>
Like most graphics programmers, he enjoys juggling, eating Chinese food, reading<br>
science fiction, and working from midafternoon till 4 or 5 in the morning. As a public<br>
service, he runs a talk-line at 976-DAVE. "If it's 3&nbsp;&nbsp;A.M. and you're bored, just give<br>
me a call (techno-weenies only)!" On the rare occasions when Dave isn't at work, you<br>
can find him hiking in the Santa Cruz Mountains, riding his mountain bike, or skiing.*
