<i>See if you can solve this programming puzzle, presented in the form of a dialog</i><br>
<i>between Konstantin Othmer (KON) and Bruce Leak (BAL). The dialog gives clues to</i><br>
<i>help you. Keep guessing until you're done; your score is the number to the left of the</i><br>
<i>clue that gave you the correct answer. These problems are supposed to be tough. If you</i><br>
<i>don't get a high score, at least you'll learn interesting Macintosh trivia.</i>
</p>
<p>
KON I wrote this program that crashes with a bus error and I can't figure out what's<br>
going wrong.
</p>
<p>
BAL If it's crashing with a bus error, that's easy: just figure out where the bogus bus<br>
error address came from.
</p>
<p>
<b>110 </b>KON Well, that's the problem. I look around and there's not a bad address<br>
anywhere.
</p>
<p>
BAL Let me see.
</p>
<p>
<b>105 </b>KON OK.
</p>
<pre>Bus Error at 1B586
1B582     BFEXTU (A3){D6; $00}, D0
1B586     *ADDQ.W     #$4,A3
1B588     MOVE.L(A2)+,D1</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;Register A3 has $70E368, and A2 has $70DEDC.&nbsp;&nbsp;So that's your puzzle; what do you<br>
do now?
</p>
<p>
BAL Hmmm. Suppose I trace a few times.
</p>
<p>
<b>100 </b>KON No problem; everything seems to work OK.
</p>
<p>
BAL What if I type "Go" and hope for the best?
</p>
<p>
<b>95</b> KON You crash immediately with an address error at $1B5A4. The code is trying to<br>
do an RTS, but the stack is trashed.
</p>
<p>
BAL Well that's just a little ways down from where I was before. Anything funny<br>
happening in between?
</p>
<p>
<b>90</b> KON Nope, just a loop that doesn't touch the stack or anything.
</p>
<p>
BAL Was the stack OK when I crashed the first time?
</p>
<p>
<b>85</b> KON No, the top address on the stack was garbage.
</p>
<p>
BAL OK, so I run the program again and break just before this routine gets called and<br>
check the stack.
</p>
<p>
<b>80</b> KON The stack is OK. Everything looks fine. You're at a JSR (A0).
</p>
<p>
BAL Is A0 OK?
</p>
<p>
<b>75</b> KON Yep, it points to the code you were looking at before--at $1B582.
</p>
<p>
BAL So I step in and look at the stack.
</p>
<p>
<b>70</b> KON You crash immediately with a bus error at $82.
</p>
<p>
BAL Huh? Sounds like someone jumped to $0.
</p>
<p>
<b>65</b> KON A0 looked OK. It was just doing a JSR (A0).
</p>
<p>
BAL Some weird MacsBug bug?
</p>
<p>
<b>60</b> KON In this case, no.
</p>
<p>
BAL All I did was step into a subroutine and I crash somewhere totally different?
</p>
<p>
<b>55</b> KON Pretty cool, huh?
</p>
<p>
BAL Are the registers OK? What does the stack look like?
</p>
<p>
<b>50</b>
</p>
<p>
KON Garbage everywhere. The stack has all kinds of noise on it, and the registers seem<br>
pretty fragged.
</p>
<p>
BAL Hmmm. I try it again; this time I set a breakpoint a few instructions before the<br>
JSR (A0).
</p>
<p>
KON OK.
</p>
<p>
BAL Is everything OK?
</p>
<p>
<b>45</b> KON The registers, stack, and code look OK.
</p>
<p>
BAL So I trace a few instructions, up to the JSR.
</p>
<p>
40 KON You crash immediately after the first trace with a bus error at $0104B0CA.
</p>
<p>
BAL Well that address is garbage. Was it in any register or on the stack before I<br>
traced?
</p>
<p>
<b>35</b> KON Nope.
</p>
<p>
BAL What happened to the stack?
</p>
<p>
<b>30</b> KON There's 56 extra bytes on it now.
</p>
<p>
BAL What? Is my machine possessed?
</p>
<p>
KON It's just a computer.
</p>
<p>
BAL Some interrupt nastiness happening?
</p>
<p>
<b>25</b> KON When you crash, you're at interrupt level 1.
</p>
<p>
BAL Now we're getting somewhere. Does MacsBug enable interrupts when I trace?
</p>
<p>
<b>20</b> KON Yes.
</p>
<p>
BAL So where's the level 1 interrupt vector kept?
</p>
<p>
<b>15</b> KON $64.
</p>
<p>
BAL I DM it and see if it's OK.
</p>
<p>
<b>10</b> KON It's $104B07C. Pretty close to where you crashed.
</p>
<p>
BAL So it sounds like someone is trashing the interrupt vectors, and all the interrupts<br>
are held pending when I'm in MacsBug. As soon as I do anything that returns control to<br>
the Macintosh, I blow up. So I step spy on $64 and see who trashes it.
</p>
<p>
<b>0</b> KON It's a routine that assumed a buffer was being allocated but wasn't. So the buffer<br>
pointer was NIL, and the routine wrote all over low memory, including the exception<br>
vectors.
</p>
<p>
BAL Nasty.
</p>
<p>
KON Yeah. So how could you catch this before the vectors get trashed?
</p>
<p>
BAL Doesn't EvenBetterBusError catch writes to NIL?
</p>
<p>
KON Only at VBL time, and the chances of a VBL interrupt happening before the VBL<br>
vector gets trashed are mighty slim.
</p>
<p>
BAL You could initialize pointer variables to a bus error number like $50FFC001<br>
instead of NIL. If you did that, you'd crash at the write and know immediately what was<br>
wrong.
</p>
<p>
KON Cool.

<b>KONSTANTIN OTHMER AND BRUCE LEAK</b> As a mere lad, Bruce pulled the<br>
programmer's key out of the stone and swore allegiance to the Lady of the Leak. Years<br>
later, while good King Bruce was doing penance for his wandering ways, young KON of<br>
Locksley had to defend the crown against the Mongol hordes attempting to draw directly<br>
to the screen. Upon his return, King Bruce declared, "Let there be time," and there<br>
was. Today young KON and his sovereign do battle against the forces of evil lurking in<br>
your local heap.*
