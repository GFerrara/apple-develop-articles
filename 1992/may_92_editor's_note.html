<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>

<h1>CAROLINE ROSE</h1>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Dear Readers,
</p>
<p>
We've made a change to <i>develop </i> that I'd like to draw to your attention for two reasons:<br>
(1) observant long-time readers may wonder why we're reverting to an old,<br>
abandoned practice, and (2) we've learned a lesson that also applies to the products<br>
you're developing.
</p>
<p>
Issues 1 through 4 of <i> develop </i> were "subtitled" January 1990 through October 1990.<br>
Our fifth issue started out 1991 not only with the since-abandoned "Vol. 2"<br>
designation, but also with the subtitle "Winter 1991." When I started this job in<br>
February 1991, I learned that the change to seasons was made because of the<br>
uncertainty of just when an issue would fall into developers' hands. But now we're<br>
switching back to months with this, our May 1992 issue.
</p>
<p>
There's the problem that it's not real clear which year any given winter belongs to,<br>
since that season spans two years. But the worst offense is that winter doesn't hit all<br>
parts of the globe at the same time. So we were confusing and offending some of our<br>
Australian developers, for example (see the first letter in the Letters section).
</p>
<p>
Localization is something that's of course critical to any products you hope to sell in<br>
other countries--sometimes even other cities or states. And it applies to both code and<br>
documentation. Way back when we were writing the first Macintosh user manual, we<br>
were surprised to get feedback that we shouldn't refer to pizza in our sample text<br>
because it was too regional. (Somehow the problem of having only white males in all<br>
the photographs was overlooked, but that's another story.)
</p>
<p>
If you're thinking that people in other countries never use your software anyway,<br>
consider this: In the song "Talkin' Wheelchair Blues" by folk singer Fred Small, a<br>
woman in a wheelchair has extreme difficulty getting into a restaurant. She tells the<br>
owner that there are things he can do to make it easier for folks in wheelchairs. The<br>
owner replies, "Oh, it's not necessary. Handicapped never come here anyway." The<br>
moral is that if you essentially shut some potential users out, of course they won't use<br>
your software.
</p>
<p>
Apple can offer some new resources to you in your quest for localization. The <i> Guide to</i><br>
<i>Software Localization</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;will be replaced by a <i> Guide to Macintosh Software Localization</i> ,<br>
to be published by Addison- Wesley and available by around late July. Besides the<br>
subtle title change, the difference between these two is that the new book will cover<br>
third-party script support as well as script systems directly supported by Apple. And<br>
by the time you read this, there should be a new APDA product, called<i>Localization for</i><br>
<i>Japan</i> , that covers the business and technical aspects of getting software into the<br>
Japanese market. You'll of course get all the latest technical details on worldwide<br>
software in the forthcoming new, improved <i>Inside Macintosh</i> .
</p>
<p>
Another change starting with this issue is that there's no longer an Apple II Q &amp; A<br>
section. Instead, we'll pass on those Q &amp; A's to the Apple II journal <i> A2-Central</i> <br>
(published by Resource Central). We think this is a better way of getting the<br>
information out to the majority of Apple II developers. All current Apple II<br>
development products previously sold through APDA are now sold through Resource<br>
Central. For more information, you can phone them at (913)469-6502.Now on to<br>
Issue 9's trivia question. Here it is again: The original hardcover <i> Inside Macintosh</i><br>
Volumes I-III had a running pattern of Macintosh computers across its endpapers . . .<br>
what broke this pattern, and why? The first two correct replies came from Tom<br>
Bernard of Bersearch Information Services and Bill Lipa of CODAR Ocean Sensors. The<br>
answer is that the screen of the last Macintosh in the back of the book contains my<br>
favorite character in the Cairo font, a rose, and it represents yours truly, the editor<br>
and principal author of that tome. The tricky part of the answer is that the rose was a<br>
surprise to me. My boss arranged for it to be put there; I didn't know about it until he<br>
handed me my first hardcover copy, hot off the press, and slyly asked me to lift up the<br>
inside end flap.
</p>
<p>
This time I've got a puzzle for you font fiddlers out there--a test of just how good your<br>
font- observing eye is: What character in <i> develop</i> 's body font is upside-down (not<br>
just one-time-only, but defined that way)? Clue: There are lots of them in this issue,<br>
but none in this editorial. Get out those magnifying glasses!

<b>&nbsp;Caroline Rose Editor</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>CAROLINE ROSE</b> (AppleLink: CROSE) has been writing computer documentation for<br>
more than half her life. She harks back to the days when using "you" in a manual was<br>
controversial. Caroline hasn't stood still: she switched from writing and programming<br>
(at Tymshare, R.I.P.) to writing and editing (<i> Inside Macintosh</i> , at Apple) to managing<br>
and editing (at NeXT) to editing <i>develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;(couldn't stay away). Besides her job at<br>
Apple, Caroline loves almost all kinds of music, dancing, and reading. Her eclectic<br>
tastes are typified by the three books she's involved in at the moment: a history of <br>
<i>MAD</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;magazine, an annotated <i>Hamlet</i> , and an Italian language textbook. A New York City<br>
transplant, Caroline thinks that nothing compares to the <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br>
or <i>real </i> New York pizza. She's occasionally nostalgic for knishes. *
