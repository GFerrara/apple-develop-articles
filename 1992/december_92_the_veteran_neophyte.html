4 A. M. Friday still feels like Thursday. Five hours remain until the contest. Bean dip<br>
slowly dries around the rim of a jar, turning a darker, almost translucent brown. This<br>
corner of the table, the one nearest the center of the room, is littered with the strange<br>
and particular combination of plastic, paper, metal, glass, and organic debris that<br>
typifies the remains of junk food. The room, a large but nondescript meeting room<br>
with beige-painted cinder block walls, is bathed in fluorescent light, 60- cycle<br>
radiation painting the few remaining occupants a lovely whitish green. 
</p>
<p>
A few of them still hunch over keyboards, pecking feverishly, squeezing the last few<br>
desperate instructions into their robots. Others sprawl on the floor around the test<br>
course, watching carefully and hopefully as their fragile creations, their little Lego<br>
and wire and motor golems, their tiny mind children, haltingly -- but autonomously<br>
-- negotiate their way toward the goal. The expressions on their faces are variously<br>
rapt, worried, and proud. 
</p>
<p>
The scene is the early morning of the last day of Artificial Life III, a week-long<br>
scientific hoe-down that took place last June in Santa Fe. The hardy hackers in the<br>
cluttered room at the back of the building are entrants in a robot-building contest that<br>
will be run as part of the "Artificial 4H Show" beginning at 9A.&nbsp;&nbsp;M. Their robot<br>
creatures run the gamut from the eminently practical to the practically insane.
</p>
<p>
The insane ones, of course, are by far the more interesting. One, appropriately named<br>
Rob Quixote, has only a single wheel, and therefore must steer by rotating an oversized<br>
horizontal windmill-like contraption fastened to its head, effectively pushing against<br>
the air to turn itself. Another moves by a sort of spastic lurching; throwing its entire<br>
front section forward, it gains an awkward quarter inch, then gathers up its<br>
hindquarters for another throw. This one is so inefficient that it requires twice the<br>
usual number of batteries, and uses them up in a single run. Amazingly enough,<br>
though, it successfully traverses the course, albeit slowly and with much ineffectual<br>
thrashing.
</p>
<p>
"Artificial life," as a named discipline, appeared on the scientific scene relatively<br>
recently. The first conference happened in the fall of 1987, and gave joyous birth to<br>
this new field of scientific inquiry, or rather this new and rich confluence of many<br>
different fields. Scientists who had been working in isolation suddenly discovered<br>
others pursuing similar lines of investigation, and the meeting of minds was electric. 
</p>
<p>
Artificial life is an attempt to create and study artificial systems -- that is, systems<br>
created by humans -- that mimic processes or exhibit behaviors usually associated<br>
only with living systems. Predictably, the primary medium that these systems are<br>
created on (in?) is computers; this is a field that depends heavily on technology to get<br>
its work done (they're doomed if electricity ever becomes unavailable).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also<br>
predictably, a large proportion of its devotees are biologists, especially theoretical<br>
biologists. 
</p>
<p>
Why would biologists want to study artificial life? Don't they already have their hands<br>
full trying to figure out the real thing? Well, for one thing, there are a lot of<br>
experiments biologists would love to do that they simply can't: nature doesn't come<br>
with convenient levers and knobs, and you can never roll back time and try something<br>
over again. So if biologists can develop good models of biological phenomena, they can<br>
implement them on computers and run clean and tidy experiments that are repeatable,<br>
detailed, controlled, and manipulable down to the last detail. This is a far cry from the<br>
messy, inexact, unrepeatable real world, and for some biologists would be tantamount<br>
to scientific nirvana. 
</p>
<p>
But there's another, larger reason for biologists to study artificial life. In the words of<br>
Chris Langton, self-described "midwife" of artificial life (he organized the first<br>
conferences and named the field), "Such systems can help us expand our understanding<br>
of life as it<i>could</i> be. By allowing us to view the life that has evolved here on Earth in<br>
the larger context of<i>possible</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;life, we may begin to derive a trulygeneral theoretical<br>
biology capable of making universal statements about life wherever it may be found<br>
and whatever it may be made of."
</p>
<p>
I like it. 
</p>
<p>
When I read this I was hooked. Visions of bizarre, unknowable alien intelligences and<br>
strange, seething soups that cling and quiver and creep around filled my head. And here<br>
are real scientists hanging around seriously discussing it! This is some serious fun!<br>
And lots of different kinds of scientists are paying attention; biologists,<br>
mathematicians, physicists, chemists, robotocists, and computerists are all well<br>
represented at the conferences, with a sprinkling of philosophers, anthropologists,<br>
economists, and others. The gee-whiz factor hooked me, but the interdisciplinary<br>
thrust of artificial life reeled me in. 
</p>
<p>
(In conversation people say "<i>a</i> -life." I've seen it written as Alife, A-life, alife, and<br>
a-life. I wanted to use alife, but people tended to pronounce it like "get a life," so I'll<br>
use a-life instead.)
</p>
<p>
Another appeal for me is the tacit approval of the "build it first, then study it"<br>
approach in a-life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method of building things and learning things (stumbling<br>
around, really, but<i>intelligent</i> stumbling,<i>directed</i> stumbling) has always been my<br>
particular forte. The premise is that we don't need to completely understand something<br>
before we can build it or build a model of it, and that it's very often more instructive<br>
to get a crude version up and working immediately than to try to refine the thing<br>
completely before trying it out. By fumbling around and building things blindly, we<br>
can often learn a lot by virtue of the happy accidents that inevitably occur. And it's<i>tons</i><br>
more fun that way. 
</p>
<p>
There were far too many interesting things at the conference to describe them all here.<br>
Instead I want to tell you about one particular talk that caused me to have a powerful<br>
"Aha!" experience (and I<i>live</i> for "Aha!" experiences). If you know something about<br>
evolution already, the following may not be news to you, but presumably most<br>
computer programmers don't study biology.
</p>
<p>
The talk dealt with Lamarckian evolution. Lamarck was a contemporary of Darwin who<br>
postulated that the things experienced by an organism during its lifetime could affect<br>
the traits handed down to the next generation. As an example, a Lamarckian might<br>
believe that proto-giraffes had to stretch their necks up to reach the leaves at the tops<br>
of the trees, and because of all the stretching, their descendants were born with longer<br>
necks. Unfortunately for Lamarck and his followers, this is rubbish. 
</p>
<p>
It turns out that as far as biological evolution is concerned, Lamarckism is<br>
nonexistent: there was no such thing at work in the development of life on Earth. So my<br>
curiosity was piqued when I saw the title of this talk by David Ackley and Michael<br>
Littman: "A Case for Distributed Lamarckian Evolution." What, were they crazy?<br>
Talking Lamarck to all these modern scientists? (At the previous conference, Ackley<br>
had one of the few really amusing presentations, so of course I would have gone no<br>
matter what the topic, but this one looked particularly juicy.)
</p>
<p>
Ackley and Littman weren't trying to convince people that Lamarckian evolution had<br>
anything to do with life on earth. What they did instead was compare the efficiencies of<br>
the two types of evolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(They created a simple evolution simulation, and then<br>
compared Darwinian and Lamarckian evolution in their abilities to find a solution to a<br>
particular problem.) Hey, this is after all<i>artificial</i> life, so if Lamarckian evolution<br>
works better, we can use it, right?
</p>
<p>
What they found was that when Lamarckian evolution was allowed to enter the picture<br>
-- when the things learned in one generation were at least partially passed on to the<br>
next -- the system was much, much better at solving the given problem. It<br>
consistently found better solutions faster in every single case they tried. This of<br>
course makes some intuitive sense. Rather than waiting for genetic shuffling to find a<br>
solution to the problem, the prior generation can point the current one in the right<br>
direction. So Lamarckian evolution is pretty much a great thing, evolutionarily<br>
speaking, because it gets you a lot further and it gets you there a lot faster. (Where it<br>
is exactly that you're going is a question for the philosophers; for the moment, let's<br>
just blithely assume that we really<i>do</i> want to getthere.) Their point was that as<br>
simulation builders we should think about using Lamarckian inheritance in our<br>
simulations, because it works so well. But this point reinforced something else that<br>
had been rolling around in my head. 
</p>
<p>
There's an evolutionary premise that I initially learned about through reading an<br>
article by a robotocist named Hans Moravec in the first Artificial Life proceedings. I<br>
learned more about it in Richard Dawkins's book<i>The Blind Watchmaker</i> and in a<br>
fascinating book called<i>Seven Clues to the Origin of Life</i> by a Glasgow chemist named<br>
Graham Cairns-Smith. This particular concept is called "genetic takeover."
</p>
<p>
According to this idea, one substance can gradually replace another as the carrier of<br>
genetic information. Cairns-Smith postulates that life began with replicating<br>
inorganic crystals -- clays, as a matter of fact -- and that a genetic takeover<br>
gradually occurred, with proteins and nucleic acids gaining in dominance until finally<br>
the original materials were no longer needed. Dawkins and Moravec (and many others)<br>
think that a genetic takeover is occurring now, with human culture taking over from<br>
nucleic acids as the evolving entity, though they differ in their candidates for the new<br>
"gene-equivalent."
</p>
<p>
Dawkins likes to speak about the "meme," a very useful term first coined in his<br>
book<i>The Selfish Gene</i> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meme is an idea, really, or a piece of information. It is<br>
immaterial, and requires a material substrate of brains, books, computers, or other<br>
media to exist. But given that substrate, the parallels with genes are very good. Just<br>
like genes, memes replicate (we tell each other good ideas, or write them down for<br>
others), memes mutate (we don't always get it right in the telling), memes mate<br>
(ideas in combination often give birth to new ones), and memes compete for survival<br>
("good" ideas stick around a long, long time, but "bad" ones die by not being passed on<br>
to anyone: mindshare is their means of existence). 
</p>
<p>
Moravec, on the other hand, seems to be more interested in the evolution of machines,<br>
and speculates convincingly and entertainingly that our machines, our artifacts, will<br>
eventually become the dominant evolving entities on Earth. Science fiction, or science<br>
fact? I don't know -- there are compelling arguments both ways -- but in either case<br>
it makes for very good reading. 
</p>
<p>
In any case, they think that perhaps here on Earth biological evolution is thoroughly<br>
obsolete, and almost despite myself I have to agree. Sure, it's still operating, but the<br>
evolution of human bodies has been completely outstripped by the evolution of human<br>
culture. Bodies evolve at an extremely slow pace, but culture evolves incredibly fast,<br>
and humans are having such a profound impact on the Earth that biology simply can't<br>
keep up. Look at the changes on Earth in the last millennium. Most of the species alive<br>
a thousand years ago have remained physically about the same, yet there's no question<br>
that the Earth has undergone a radical transformation, and primarily at the hands of<br>
humans, as a by- product of their culture. (You might hesitate to call the rampant,<br>
wanton destruction and boundless consumption of resources that Earth has suffered at<br>
the hands of humans "evolution," but remember that the word "evolution" does<i>not</i> <br>
necessarily imply improvement.) But why is it going so fast? How come humans do<br>
this and other species don't? 
</p>
<p>
One of the primary distinctions between human beings and their close animal relatives<br>
is language.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans can communicate with abstract symbols, and their<br>
communications can be "fossilized" in time (that is, written down for later). Here<br>
comes the "Aha!" we've all been waiting for: this ability allows humans to engage in a<br>
form of Lamarckian evolution! The things we learn in our lifetimes<i>can</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;be passed on to<br>
the next generation, though in a filtered sort of way. We can't change the way our<br>
offspring are built, but we<i>can</i> change their behavior (teenagers notwithstanding).<br>
Other species do this to some extent, but humans are the unquestioned champs at<br>
shaping their offspring. 
</p>
<p>
As you can see, a-life -- just like life itself -- is rife with philosophical conundrums<br>
and radical, thought-provoking concepts, and that's much of the reason I stay<br>
interested. But probably the biggest reason of all that I like a-life is hard to express,<br>
except by analogy: I get the same feeling peering through a glass screen into a<br>
computer world full of digital critters that I do peering through the bars of a cage at<br>
the zoo. The xenophile in me wants to see all the forms that life can take, and get to<br>
know the minds of every other being. I want to puzzle out the motivations behind a<br>
critter's behavior, and I love that shock of recognition I experience every time I look<br>
into an animal's eyes -- even the ones that are so alien, like birds and reptiles and<br>
fish.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it's this feeling that there are universal properties of life waiting to be<br>
discovered, properties that apply not only to life as it has evolved on Earth but to<br>
all<i>possible</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;life, including the digital variety. 
</p>
<p>
Are any of these a-life explorations really alive? That's an energetic and ongoing<br>
debate among a- lifers, of course, and the answer ultimately depends on the definition<br>
you pick for the word "life." Rather than arguing whether metabolism is more<br>
necessary to life than reproduction, though, I like to duck the definition issue. I don't<br>
really care too much whether we<i>call</i> them alive, I want to see if people react to them<i>as</i><br>
<i>if</i> they're alive. I want to see that shock of recognition occur when people and digital<br>
organisms collide. (What if "they" recognize "us"?!) It's sort of the Turing Test<br>
approach for life: if it seems alive -- if people can't tell that it's<i>not</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;alive -- then no<br>
matter what we call it, people will treat it as if it's alive. <i>That</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to see.

<b>DAVE JOHNSON</b>'s mother recently moved across the country, and sent him a total of<br>
eight large cardboard boxes crammed with junk spanning his entire life that she didn't<br>
want cluttering her garage any more. Among his old school stuff was a report card<br>
from second grade that included a couple of N's, meaning "needs improvement." The N's<br>
were in the categories of "Is Prompt" and "Works Steadily." Here's a quote from his<br>
teacher, Mrs. Doris Short, that accompanied the report: "We've talked about being<br>
prompt, but it's always 'I'll finish tomorrow.'" This is strong evidence for the claim<br>
that personality is established early in life, and never changes. *
