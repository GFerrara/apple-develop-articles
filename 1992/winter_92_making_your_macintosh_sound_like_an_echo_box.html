<h2>MAKING YOUR MACINTOSH SOUND LIKE AN ECHO BOX</h2>
<h1>RICH COLLYER</h1>

</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;Happy notes for sound buffs: As you'll see from the sample code provided on the</i><br>
<i>Developer CD Series disc, you can make your Macintosh play and record sounds at the</i><br>
<i>same time, simply by using double buffering to record into one buffer while playing a</i><br>
<i>second buffer, and then flipping between the buffers. If you want to take things a few</i><br>
<i>steps further, pull out elements of this code and tailor them to suit your own acoustic</i><br>
<i>needs.</i>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;We all know that the Macintosh is a sound machine, so to speak, but with a little<br>
clever programming you can turn it into an echo box as well. The sample<br>
2BufRecordToBufCmd included on the<i>Developer CD Series</i> disc is just a small<br>
application (sans interface) that demonstrates one way to record sounds at the same<br>
time that you're playing them. There are other ways to achieve the same goal, but my<br>
purpose is to educate you about the Sound Manager, not to lead you down the definitive<br>
road to becoming your own recording studio. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;In addition to the main routine, 2BufRecordToBufCmd includes various setup routines<br>
and a completion routine. For easy reading, I've left out any unnecessary code out of<br>
this article. 
</p>
<h2>CONSTANT COMMENTS</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;Before I get into the sample code itself, here are a few of the constants you'll run into<br>
in the application. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;GETTING A HANDLE ON IT</b><br>
The kMilliSecondsOfSound constant is used to declare how many milliseconds of sound<br>
the application should record before it starts to play back. The smaller the number of<br>
milliseconds, the more quickly the sound is played back. This constant is used to<br>
calculate the size of the 'snd ' buffer handles (just the data). Depending on the sound<br>
effect you're after, kMilliSecondsOfSound can range from 50 milliseconds to 400,000<br>
or so. If you set it below 50, you risk problems: there may not be enough time for the<br>
completion routine to finish executing before it's called again. On the high end of the<br>
range, only the application's available memory limits the size. The smaller the value,<br>
of course, the faster the buffers fill up and play back, and the faster an echo effect<br>
you'll get. A millisecond value of 1000 provides a one-second delay between record and<br>
echo, which I've found is good for general use. You'll want to experiment to find the<br>
effect you like. (Beware of feedback, both from your machine and from anyone who's in<br>
close enough proximity to "enjoy" the experimentation secondhand.)
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;YOUR HEAD SIZE, AND OTHER #DEFINES</b><br>
The next three constants (kBaseHeaderSize, kSynthSize, and kCmdSize) are used to<br>
parse the sound header buffers in the routine FindHeaderSize. kBaseHeaderSize is the<br>
number of bytes at the top of all 'snd ' headers that aren't needed in the application<br>
itself. While the number of bytes isn't really ofinterest here, you need to parse the<br>
header in order to find the part of the sound header that you'll pass to the bufferCmd.<br>
How much you parse off the top is determined by the format of the header and the type<br>
of file; for the purposes of this code, however, all you need to be concerned with are<br>
the 'snd ' resources. The second constant, kSynthSize, is the size of one 'snth'. In the<br>
calculations of the header, I find out how many 'snth's there are, and multiply that<br>
number by kSynthSize. The last constant, kCmdSize, is the size of one command, which<br>
is used in the same way as kSynthSize.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(These equations are derived from<i>Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i> Volume VI, page 22-20.)
</p>
<p>
<b>ERROR CHECKING WITH EXITWITHMESSAGE</b><br>
2BufRecordToBufCmd includes error checking, but only as a placeholder for future<br>
commercialization of the product. If the present code detects an error, it calls the<br>
ExitWithMessage routine, which displays a dialog box that tells you more or less<br>
where the error occurred and what the error was. Closing this dialog box quits the<br>
application, at which point you have to start over again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that calling<br>
ExitWithMessage at interrupt time could be fatal, since it uses routines that might<br>
move memory. For errors that could occur at interrupt time, DebugStr is used instead.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>USING THE SOUND INPUT DRIVER</h2>
<p>
Use of the sound input driver is fairly well documented in<i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume VI,<br>
Chapter 22 (pages 22-58 through 22-68 and 22-92 through 22-99), but here's a<br>
little overview of what 2BufRecordToBufCmd does at this point in the routine, and<br>
why. When you use sound input calls at the low level (not using SndRecord or<br>
SndRecordToFile), you need to open the sound input driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section of the code<br>
just opens the driver, which the user selects via the sound cdev. 
</p>
<pre>gError = SPBOpenDevice (kDefaultDriver, siWritePermission,
            &amp;gSoundRefNum);</pre>
<p>
To open the driver, you call SPBOpenDevice and pass in a couple of simple parameters.<br>
The first parameter is a driver name. It doesn't really matter what the name of the<br>
driver is; it simply needs to be the user-selected driver, so the code passes in nil<br>
(which is what kDefaultDriver translates into).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constant siWritePermission<br>
tells the driver you'd like read/write permission to the sound input driver. This will<br>
enable the application to actually use the recording calls. The last parameter is the<br>
gSoundRefNum. This parameter is needed later in the sample so that you can ask<br>
specific questions about the driver that's open. The error checking is just to make sure<br>
that nothing went wrong; if something did go wrong, the code goes to ExitWithMessage,<br>
and then the sample quits. 
</p>
<pre>gError = SPBSetDeviceInfo (gSoundRefNum, siContinuous,
           (Ptr) &amp;contOnOff);</pre>
<p>
Continuous recording is activated here to avoid a "feature" of the new Macintosh Quadra<br>
700 and 900 that gives you a slowly increasing ramp of the sound input levels to their<br>
normal levels each time you call SPBRecord. The result in 2BufRecordToBufCmd is a<br>
pause and gradual increase in the sound volume between buffers as the buffers are<br>
being played. Continuous recording gives you this ramp only on the first buffer, where<br>
it's almost unnoticeable. 
</p>
<h2>BUILDING 'SND ' BUFFERS</h2>
<p>
Now that the sound input driver is open, the code can get the information it needs to<br>
build the 'snd ' buffers. As its name implies, 2BufRecordToBufCmd uses two buffers.<br>
The reason is sound (no pun intended): The code basically uses a double-buffer method<br>
to record and play the buffers. The code doesn't tell the machine to start to play the<br>
sound until the recording completion routine has been called, so you don't have to<br>
worry about playing a buffer before it has been filled with recorded data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The code<br>
also does not restart the recording until the previous buffer has started to play. 
</p>
<p>
<b>INFORMATION, PLEASE</b><br>
To build the sound headers, you need to get some information from the sound input<br>
driver about how the sound data will be recorded and stored. That's the function of the<br>
GetSoundDeviceInfo routine, which looks for information about the SampleRate (the<br>
number of samples per second at which the sound is recorded), the SampleSize (the<br>
sample size of the sound being recorded--8 bits per sample is normal), the<br>
CompressionType (see "Putting on the Squeeze"), the NumberChannels(the number of<br>
sound input channels, normally 1), and the DeviceBufferInfo (the size of the internal<br>
buffers). 
</p>
<p>
This code (minus the error checking) extracts these values from the sound input<br>
driver. 
</p>
<pre>gError = SPBGetDeviceInfo (gSoundRefNum, siSampleRate,
        (Ptr) &amp;gSampleRate);

gError = SPBGetDeviceInfo (gSoundRefNum, siSampleSize,
        (Ptr) &amp;gSampleSize);

gError = SPBGetDeviceInfo (gSoundRefNum, siCompressionType,
        (Ptr) &amp;gCompression);

gError = SPBGetDeviceInfo (gSoundRefNum, siNumberChannels,
        (Ptr) &amp;gNumberOfChannels);

gError = SPBGetDeviceInfo (gSoundRefNum, siDeviceBufferInfo,
        (Ptr) &amp;gInternalBuffer);

value = kMilliSecondsOfSound;
gError = SPBMillisecondsToBytes (gSoundRefNum, &amp;value);
gSampleAreaSize = (value / gInternalBuffer) * gInternalBuffer;</pre>
<p>
Opening the sound input driver gives you the gSoundRefNum. The values siSampleRate,<br>
siSampleSize, siCompressionType, siNumberChannels, and siDeviceBufferInfo are<br>
constants defined in the SoundInput.h file; these constants tell the SPBGetDeviceInfo<br>
call what information you want.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last parameter is a pointer to a global variable.<br>
The SPBGetDeviceInfo call uses this parameter to return the requested information. 
</p>
<p>
The last bit of work the code needs to do before it's ready to start building the 'snd '<br>
headers is to convert the constant kMilliSecondsOfSound to the sample size of the<br>
buffer. To do this, the routine needs to call SPBMillisecondsToBytes and then round<br>
down the resulting value to a multiple of the size of the internal sound buffer. This is<br>
to bypass a bug connected with the continuous recording feature of Apple's built-in<br>
sound input device, which will collect garbage rather than audio data if the recording<br>
buffer is not a multiple of the device's internal buffer. Creating a buffer of the right<br>
size not only avoids this problem, but also enables the input device to more efficiently<br>
record data into your buffer. 
</p>
<p>
Now the code has the information it needs to build the sound buffers. To save code<br>
space, I've made a short routine that builds the buffers and their headers. All the code<br>
has to do is call this routine for each of the buffers it needs and pass in the appropriate<br>
data. 
</p>
<p>
<b>IT'S A SETUP</b><br>
The first line of code in the SetupSounds routine is fairly obvious. It simply calls the<br>
Memory Manager to allocate the requested handles, based on the known size of the data<br>
buffer and an estimated maximum size for the header, and does some error checking<br>
(see the code itself). Then, if the handle is good, the routine builds the 'snd ' header.<br>
Setting up the sound buffer requires building the header by making a simple call,<br>
SetupSndHeader, to the Sound Manager. There's a small problem with calling<br>
SetupSndHeader only once, however: When you call it, you don't know how big the<br>
sound header is, so you just give the call the buffer, along with a 0 value for the buffer<br>
size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the call returns with the header built, one of the values in the<br>
header--the one that's the number of bytes in the sample--will be wrong. (The<br>
header size will be correct, but the data in the header will not be.) To correct this, you<br>
simply wait until your recording is complete and then put the correct number of bytes<br>
directly into the header, at which time you'll know how much data there is to play<br>
back. The misinformation in the header won't affect your recording, only the playback.<br>
Once the header's built, the code resets the size of the handle, moves the handle high<br>
(to avoid fragmentation of the heap), and locks it down. It's important to lock down the<br>
handles in this way; otherwise the Sound Manager will move the sound buffers it's<br>
working with out from under itself. 
</p>
<pre>*bufferHandle = NewHandle (gSampleAreaSize + kEstimatedHeaderSize);

gError = SetupSndHeader (*bufferHandle, gNumberOfChannels,
    gSampleRate, gSampleSize, gCompression, kMiddleC, 0, headerSize);

SetHandleSize (*bufferHandle, (Size) *headerSize + gSampleAreaSize);
MoveHHi (*bufferHandle);
HLock (*bufferHandle);</pre>
<h2>TELLING IT WHERE TO GO</h2>
<p>
The next part of the program allocates and initializes a sound input parameter block,<br>
gRecordStruct.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This structure tells the sound input call how to do what the code wants<br>
it to do. 
</p>
<p>
The first instruction is obvious: it simply creates a new pointer into which the<br>
structure can be stored. 
</p>
<pre>gRecordStruct = (SPBPtr) NewPtr (sizeof (SPB));</pre>
<p>
The recording call will need to know where it can find the open sound input driver, so<br>
next it needs the reference number to the driver (gSoundRefNum). The subsequent<br>
three lines of code inform the recording call how much buffer space it has to record<br>
into. Here, you could either give the call a count value, tell it how many milliseconds<br>
are available for recording, or give it the size of the sound buffer. For this code, it's<br>
easiest to just make the bufferLength the same as the count and ignore the milliseconds<br>
value.&nbsp;&nbsp;The code then tells the recording call where to put the sound data as it's<br>
recorded. 
</p>
<pre>gRecordStruct-&gt;inRefNum = gSoundRefNum;
gRecordStruct-&gt;count = gSampleAreaSize;
gRecordStruct-&gt;milliseconds = 0;
gRecordStruct-&gt;bufferLength = gSampleAreaSize;
gRecordStruct-&gt;bufferPtr = (Ptr) ((*bufferHandle) + gHeaderLength);
gRecordStruct-&gt;completionRoutine = (ProcPtr) MyRecComp;
gRecordStruct-&gt;interruptRoutine = nil;
gRecordStruct-&gt;userLong = SetCurrentA5();
gRecordStruct-&gt;error = 0;
gRecordStruct-&gt;unused1 = 0;</pre>
<p>
The recording call also needs to know what to do when it's finished recording. Since the<br>
call is done asynchronously, it needs a completion routine. (I'll talk more about this<br>
routine later on.)&nbsp;&nbsp;You<i>could</i> leave out the completion routine and just poll the driver<br>
periodically to see if it's finished recording.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do that, you'd repeatedly call the<br>
routine SPBGetRecordStatus, and when the status routine informed you that recording<br>
was finished, you'd restart the recording and play the buffer that had just been filled.<br>
For this code, however, it's better to know as soon as possible when the recording is<br>
done because the more quickly you can restart the recording, the more likely you are<br>
to prevent pauses between recordings. 
</p>
<p>
The userLong field is a good place to store 2BufRecordToBufCmd's A5 value, which<br>
you'll need in order to have access to the application's global variables from the<br>
completion routine. As you can see, the rest of the fields are set to 0. The code doesn't<br>
need an interrupt routine. There's also no point in passing an error back or using the<br>
unused1 field. 
</p>
<p>
You'd need to use an interrupt routine if you wanted to change the recorded sound<br>
before compression, or before the completion routine was called (see "Routine<br>
Interruptions"). 
</p>
<p>
<b>TIME TO CHANNEL</b><br>
Just before the code jumps into the main loop, it needs to open a sound channel. This<br>
generally is not a big deal, but for 2BufRecordToBufCmd, I initialized the channel to<br>
use no interpolation. 
</p>
<pre>gError = SndNewChannel (&amp;gChannel, sampledSynth, initNoInterp, nil);</pre>
<p>
Interpolation causes clicks between the sound buffers when they're played back to<br>
back, which can be a rather annoying addition to your recording (unless, of course,<br>
you're going for that samba beat). 
</p>
<p>
<b>JUST FOR THE RECORD</b><br>
To start recording, all the code needs to do now is call the low-level recording routine,<br>
pass in gRecordStruct, and tell it that it wants the recording to occur asynchronously. 
</p>
<pre>gError = SPBRecord (gRecordStruct, true);</pre>
<h2>LOOP THE LOOP</h2>
<p>
The main loop of this code is a simple while loop that waits until the mouse button is<br>
pressed or an error occurs in the recording, at which time the application quits. 
</p>
<pre>/* main loop of the app */
while (!Button() || (gRecordStruct-&gt;error &lt; noErr));</pre>
<p>
<b>ROUTINE COMPLETION</b><br>
You don't want a completion routine to do much, generally, since it's run at interrupt<br>
time and keeps your system locked up while it's running. There are three parts to this<br>
completion routine, one of which has four parts to itself. 
</p>
<p>
The first part of the completion routine sets its A5 value to be the same as the A5 value<br>
of the application. This gives you access to the application's global variables from the<br>
completion routine. 
</p>
<pre>storeA5 = SetA5 (inParamPtr-&gt;userLong);</pre>
<p>
If the completion routine weren't broken into two parts here, the MPW C compiler<br>
optimization scheme would cause a problem at this point: access to global arrays would<br>
be pointed to in an address register as an offset of A5 before you had a chance to set A5<br>
to your application's A5 value, and you'd get garbage information. Therefore, it's<br>
necessary to restore your A5 value (part 1 of the completion routine) and then call<br>
the secondary completion routine to actually do all the work. 
</p>
<p>
Before the routine does any work, it needs to make sure that there have not been any<br>
problems with the recording. If there were errors, the code drops out of the<br>
completion routine without doing anything.
</p>
<pre>if (gRecordStruct-&gt;error &lt; 0)
    return;</pre>
<p>
Next the routine prepares the header of the buffer, which has just been filled, by<br>
correcting the header's length field. This field needs to be set to the count field of<br>
gRecordStruct, which now contains the actual number of bytes recorded. 
</p>
<pre>header = (SoundHeaderPtr)(*(gBufferHandle[gWhichRecordBuffer]) +
    gHeaderSize);
header-&gt;length = gRecordStruct-&gt;count;</pre>
<p>
Once the header's been fixed, the code just sends the buffer handle off to the play<br>
routine to play the sound. (See "Play Time" for a full explanation of the play routine.)
</p>
<pre>PlayBuffer (gBufferHandle[gWhichRecordBuffer]);</pre>
<p>
The last part of the real completion routine prepares gRecordStruct to start the next<br>
recording. To do this, the code needs to select the correct buffer to record to and<br>
rebuild gRecordStruct to reflect any changes. The macro NextBuffer performs an XOR<br>
on the variable gWhichRecordBuffer to make it either 1 or 0. The changes include<br>
setting the correct buffer to record to and checking to see that the bufferLength is<br>
correct. Once the structure is reset, the code makes the next call to SPBRecord to<br>
restart the recording. 
</p>
<pre>#define NextBuffer(x) (x ^= 1)

gWhichRecordBuffer = NextBuffer (gWhichRecordBuffer);
gRecordStruct-&gt;bufferPtr = (*(gBufferHandle[gWhichRecordBuffer]) +
    gDataStart);
gRecordStruct-&gt;milliseconds = 0;
gRecordStruct-&gt;count = gSampleAreaSize;
gRecordStruct-&gt;bufferLength = gSampleAreaSize;

err = SPBRecord (gRecordStruct, true);</pre>
<p>
The last piece of the completion routine resets A5 to what its value was when the<br>
routine started. 
</p>
<pre>storeA5 = SetA5 (storeA5);</pre>
<p>
<b>PLAY TIME</b><br>
The code in the PlayBuffer routine is very simple Sound Manager code. All it does is set<br>
up the command parameters and call SndDoCommand. The routine needs to know what<br>
channel to play into and what buffer to play, so the code sets up the local sound<br>
structure by telling it which buffer to play, and sends that local structure to<br>
SndDoCommand along with the necessary channel information (gChannel). <br>
SndDoCommand then plays the sound. The last parameter in the SndDoCommand call,<br>
false, basically tells the Sound Manager to always insert the command in the channel's<br>
queue: if the queue is full, SndDoCommand will wait until there's space to insert the<br>
command before returning. 
</p>
<pre>localSndCmd.cmd = bufferCmd;
localSndCmd.param1 = 0;
localSndCmd.param2 = (long) ((*bufferHandle) + gHeaderSize);
gError = SndDoCommand (gChannel, &amp;localSndCmd, false);</pre>
<p>
If you wanted to send the sounds to a different machine to be played, you could simply<br>
replace the code in the the PlayBuffer routine with IPC or Communications Toolbox<br>
calls telling a second machine to play the buffers. 
</p>
<h2>CLEANING UP AFTER THE SHOW</h2>
<p>
Once the code finds the mouse button down or discovers that an error occurred in the<br>
recording and exits the main loop, there's only one last thing to do: clean up. The first<br>
part of cleaning up is to close the sound input driver. Before you can close the driver,<br>
you need to make sure it's not in use; the routine SPBStopRecording stops the<br>
recording. 
</p>
<pre>gError = SPBStopRecording (gSoundRefNum);
SPBCloseDevice (gSoundRefNum);</pre>
<p>
Next you need to dispose of the handles and pointers you've been using. Before sending<br>
them on their way, however, you have to make sure that they have been allocated, so<br>
the code checks to see whether or not the handles and pointer are nil. 
</p>
<pre>for (index = 0; index &lt; kNumberOfBuffers; ++index)
    DisposeHandle (gBufferHandle[index]);
DisposePtr ((Ptr) gRecordStruct);</pre>
<p>
Last but not least, the code disposes of the sound channel for you. Setting the quitNow<br>
flag clears the sound queue before the channel is closed. 
</p>
<pre>gError = SndDisposeChannel (gChannel, true);</pre>
<h2>COMPOSE YOURSELF</h2>
<p>
So now you know a little bit more about doing basic sound input at a low level.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've<br>
fielded many questions about clicks, pauses between buffers, and so on, which I've<br>
resolved and built into 2BufRecordToBufCmd. The specific techniques I've outlined<br>
here may not apply to what you're interested in doing right now, but if you're using<br>
the sound input driver or are interested in continuous recording, parts of this sample<br>
may be useful to you in some other application. You've heard the saying "take what you<br>
like and leave the rest"? Sound advice (so to speak). 
</p>
<h2>GESTALT YOUR MACHINE</h2>
<p>
You do need to check two rather critical sound attributes for 2BufRecordToBufCmd.<br>
First of all, your machine must have a sound input driver. There's very little point in<br>
trying to record sounds if the sample is being run on a machine that doesn't have sound<br>
input capabilities. Checking bit 5 of the returned feature variable with the Gestalt<br>
Manager will give you this handy bit of information.
</p>
<p>
Second, your hardware needs to support stereo sound, since you need one channel for<br>
sound input and one for sound output. Check for this attribute by checking bit 0 of the<br>
returned feature variable.
</p>
<p>
The following code shows how you can test all of the bits returned in the feature<br>
variable. (I didn't use this code in my sample.)
</p>
<pre>err = Gestalt (gestaltSoundAttr, &amp;feature);
if (!err) {
    if (feature &amp; (1 << gestaltStereoCapability))
        //This Macintosh Supports Stereo (test bit 0)
    if (feature &amp; (1 << gestaltStereoMixing))
        //This Macintosh Supports Stereo Mixing (test bit 1)
    if (feature &amp; (1 << gestaltSoundIOMgrPresent))
        //This Macintosh Has the New Sound Manager (test bit 3)
    if (feature &amp; (1 << gestaltBuiltInSoundInput))
        //This Macintosh Has Built-in Sound Input (test bit 4)
    if (feature &amp; (1 << gestaltHasSoundInputDevice))
        //This Macintosh Supports Sound Input (test bit 5)
    }</pre>
<h2>PUTTING ON THE SQUEEZE</h2>
<p>
If you want to use compression for 2BufRecordToBufCmd, keep in mind that the Sound<br>
Manager basically supports three types of sound compression: none at all, which is<br>
what I'm using, and MAC3 and MAC6, which are Mace compression types for 3:1 and<br>
6:1 compression, respectively.
</p>
<p>
If you set the compression, the sound data is compressed after the interrupt routine is<br>
called (if you have one) and before the Sound Manager internal buffers are moved to<br>
the application's sound buffers.
</p>
<p>
You have a couple of options for playing back a compressed sound. Either the bufferCmd<br>
or SndPlay will decompress the sounds on the fly. If you need to decompress a sound<br>
yourself, you'll want to call the Sound Manager routine Exp1to3 or Exp1to6<br>
(depending on the compression you were using).
</p>
<h2>ROUTINE INTERRUPTIONS</h2>
<p>
The interrupt routine gives you a chance to manipulate the sound data before any sound<br>
compression is done. For some of the operations that you may want to carry out inside<br>
the interrupt routine, you'll need access to the A5 world of the application, which is<br>
why I stored 2BufRecordToBufCmd's A5 value in the userLong field of<br>
gRecordStruct.For more information about sound interrupt routines, take a look at <br>
<i>Inside Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume VI, page 22-63.
</p>
<p>
<i>Warning:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't try to accomplish too much in an interrupt routine. In general, you'll<br>
want interrupts to be minimal, and possibly written in assembly language, to avoid<br>
unnecessary compiler-generated code.
