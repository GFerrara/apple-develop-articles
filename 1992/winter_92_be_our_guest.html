<h1>BACKGROUND-ONLY APPLICATIONS IN SYSTEM 7</h1>

<p>
One of the least heralded new features of System 7, but nonetheless a very important<br>
one, is full support for faceless background applications (FBAs). An FBA is a<br>
full-fledged application that's invisible to the user. It has its own event loop, and it<br>
receives time and some events like any other application, but it doesn't have a menu<br>
bar, windows, dialogs, or other graphic components. An FBA is a normal file of type<br>
'APPL'. 
</p>
<p>
FBAs are, by a stretch of the imagination, similar to UNIX&#174; daemons. The purpose of<br>
an FBA is to provide services to other applications or to monitor the system. For<br>
instance, an application that periodically checks your hard drive for files that haven't<br>
been backed up lately is a perfect candidate for FBA status. Thus, an FBA can be a silent<br>
partner to your application, INIT, cdev, desk accessory, or driver.
</p>
<p>
An FBA is the best way to provide certain services. For example, an FBA paired with a<br>
desk accessory can enable the DA to send Apple events, something a DA cannot usually<br>
do. (See the AECDEV/AEDAEMON sample in the snippets provided with the DTS Sample<br>
Code on the<i>Developer CD Series</i> disc.) An FBA can replace an INIT that patches traps to<br>
get time and provides services, or it can replace a driver that depended on periodic run<br>
messages to operate. Converting to an FBA not only frees you from having to patch to<br>
get the time you need, but also gives you a fully supported and documented interface<br>
and design. You get all the advantages of a full application, without the overhead of a<br>
user interface. 
</p>
<p>
An FBA can also be an application manager for a suite of applications. With an FBA, you<br>
can control the launching of and communication between applications, using<br>
LaunchApplication and Apple events. 
</p>
<p>
Writing an FBA is simple. An FBA is a subset of a standard Macintosh application,<br>
consisting of a minimal event loop and the code to handle two types of events, null<br>
events and high-level events. No other events are sent to an FBA. This makes a great<br>
deal of sense, since every other event (keystroke, mouse click, and such) is designed<br>
for foreground applications. 
</p>
<p>
The SmallDaemon backgrounder shell included on the<i>Developer CD Series</i> disc shows<br>
just how simple the basics of an FBA are:
</p>
<pre>Boolean         gQuit = false;
EventRecord     gERecord;
unsigned long   gMySleep = 50000; /* A long, long time */
main()
{
    /* Routine for installing my Apple event handlers.
       Need to install the four required
       handlers, plus handlers for any other events
       I want to accept. */
    InitAEStuff();
    while (gQuit == false) {
        /* A normal call to WaitNextEvent. I want
           only highLevelEvents, since all other
           events relate to interface actions, and I
           have no interface. */
        if (WaitNextEvent(highLevelEventMask, &amp;gERecord, gMySleep,
               0)) {
            /* I'll get only null and high-level events. */
            switch (gERecord.what) {
            case nullEvent:
            /* No null processing in this sample. */
            break;
           
            case kHighLevelEvent:
            /* Get a high-level event (an Apple event) and process */
            /* it. */
            DoHighLevel(&amp;gERecord);
            break;
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>
As you can see, there's not much there. The first thing you'll notice is that an FBA<br>
doesn't start up any managers. All the managers you normally start are based on user<br>
interface actions. Thus, they should<i> not</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;be called in an FBA--in fact, calling them will<br>
cause your FBA to crash. There's one exception to this rule: you can initialize<br>
QuickDraw, but<i>only</i> to provide yourself with off-screen grafPorts or to use some<br>
QuickDraw functions. Do not do any actual screen drawing from an FBA.
</p>
<p>
You'll also notice that you don't pass a mouse region to WaitNextEvent. That's obvious,<br>
since you're never in the foreground and have no windows or mouse control to track.<br>
And the only events you'll be handling are null events and high-level events (Apple<br>
events). 
</p>
<p>
The next step is to make sure the system knows that you're a background-only<br>
application. You do this with a SIZE resource, by setting the canBackground and<br>
onlyBackground bits to true. When the Finder launches your FBA, it checks these bits<br>
and finds that you're a background-only application. 
</p>
<p>
Some tips and techniques to keep in mind:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Always remember that an FBA is invisible to the user. An FBA does<i>not</i> <br>
show up in the Process menu or in the Finder About window. Also, its heap<br>
memory is added to the system size thermometer bar in the Finder About<br>
window, even though it has its own application heap. The user often will have<br>
no idea that it's running, so be friendly. </li>
<li>Being friendly means yielding time. Have a very large sleep time when<br>
you're not actually doing some processing. If you don't, users will think that<br>
their machine has slowed down inexplicably.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can always use the new<br>
Process Manager call WakeUpProcess to get yourself back into fast processing<br>
when you need to. </li>
<li>Being friendly also means making sure you're occupying the<i>smallest</i>  heap<br>
size you can possibly run in. Again, users may never know that your FBA<br>
exists, so if you eat up a bunch of memory in your FBA, users will not<br>
understand why they've lost so much memory. Be conservative. </li>
<li>Putting your FBA in the Startup Items folder in the System Folder is also<br>
a good idea. That will ensure that your FBA is launched right after Finder<br>
startup and will put the FBA high in the Process Manager's heap, preventing<br>
fragmentation of application memory space. </li>
<li>Use WakeUpProcess to get your FBA running. Keep your sleep time at<br>
maximum normally, and when you need to start doing null processing (in<br>
response to an Apple event or PPC completion routine, for example) use the<br>
Process Manager to wake yourself up. WakeUpProcess can be called at<br>
interrupt time. Then, when you've finished processing, drop back to a<br>
maximum sleep time.</li>
</ul>
