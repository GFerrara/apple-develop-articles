<p>
Many developers want to go beyond the speed of QuickDraw. Writing directly to the<br>
screen can allow you to create faster animation and graphics than possible with<br>
QuickDraw. However, Apple has always maintained that writing to video memory is<br>
unsupported, since it may cause your application to break on a future system. If you<br>
write directly to the screen, your application will forfeit the use of many Toolbox<br>
managers and will put future compatibility at risk. Since most applications require<br>
the Window Manager and other basic Macintosh managers, writing to the screen is only<br>
for a few specialized applications, such as video games and some animation packages<br>
that compete on the quality and speed of graphics.
</p>
<p>
We're providing guidelines for writing to the screen in this column because we know<br>
that some developers are already doing it. We also understand that, in today's market,<br>
you need every advantage you can get in order to be competitive.
</p>
<p>
<b>BEFORE YOU READ ON</b><br>
The most important thing to remember is<i>don't write directly to the screen if you don't</i><br>
<i>have to</i> . In general, only a few applications need to do this. If you're porting an<br>
existing graphics or animation library from another system, or writing an application<br>
that competes mainly on the speed of the graphics, writing directly to the screen may<br>
be necessary. For any other applications, turn back now and forget about writing to the<br>
screen. 
</p>
<p>
Even if your application is animation intensive or a port from another system, we<br>
recommend that you always attempt to use QuickDraw first. QuickDraw may be fast<br>
enough for your purposes, and it would not be wise to sacrifice its compatibility and<br>
flexibility for no reason. You should always have a QuickDraw version of your code<br>
anyway, and it should be the default, in case your program isn't compatible with the<br>
system or video card being used. Writing directly to the screen should be a user-<br>
selectable option. 
</p>
<p>
As an alternative to writing to the screen, your application may be able to increase<br>
graphics performance by using custom drawing routines in a GWorld and CopyBits to<br>
transfer your image to the screen. This allows you to have faster graphics while<br>
avoiding the compatibility nightmare that you may face by writing directly to the<br>
screen. To learn more about custom drawing routines, see "Drawing in GWorlds for<br>
Speed and Versatility" in<i>develop</i> Issue 10. 
</p>
<p>
We hope we've scared almost everyone away. For those of you still reading, we want to<br>
point out that violating one compatibility guideline doesn't mean your program should<br>
break others: you still need to follow certain rules in order to peacefully coexist with<br>
other applications. For example, don't assume the screen is a fixed size or depth. Use<br>
data structures like GDevice and screenBits to access this information (<i>Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i> Volume VI, page 3-7). So remember, most applications have no need to<br>
write directly to the screen, and if you choose to do it, it may give you more<br>
compatibility headaches than you're ready for. If your program breaks in the future<br>
because you decided to write to the screen, it will be<i>your</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;responsibility to fix it. We<br>
feel that the methods outlined in this column will give you the best chance of future<br>
compatibility; however, there are no guarantees. 
</p>
<p>
<b>WHERE'D THAT MANAGER GO?</b><br>
In addition to risking compatibility problems, writing directly to the screen means<br>
you have to do a lot of extra work. Specifically, you have to handle (or live without)<br>
many of the tasks that Toolbox managers would normally handle for you. 
</p>
<p>
You lose the full benefit of QuickDraw's graphics routines, most importantly the<br>
clipping ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Window Manager uses QuickDraw for its clipping, you<br>
lose the ability to have multiple overlapping windows as part of your application's<br>
interface. If your application requires multiple overlapping windows, you don't want<br>
to be writing directly to the screen. 
</p>
<p>
You lose the ability to stretch your windows across multiple monitors. QuickDraw<br>
automagically has the ability to split the contents of a window across multiple<br>
monitors. If you write directly to the screen, you'll be limited to one monitor, or<br>
you'll have to write a lot of code that has already been implemented in QuickDraw. 
</p>
<p>
You lose the Help Manager. The Help Manager displays its balloons in a window over<br>
your application's window. If you're writing directly to the screen, you'll blast the<br>
Help Manager's windows. 
</p>
<p>
You lose QuickDraw's ability to map pictures and pixMaps from one color environment<br>
to another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replacing such code with your own is nontrivial. Just try writing an<br>
image-copying routine that deals with simultaneous multiple pixel depths and you'll<br>
gain a new respect for CopyBits! 
</p>
<p>
You restrict your ability to print. The Printing Manager only understands QuickDraw.<br>
To print you'll have to use your drawing code to render your images and then use<br>
CopyBits to transfer them to the printing grafPort. This means sacrificing quality on<br>
the printed page, since pixMaps generally don't look as nice on the printer as objects<br>
composed of QuickDraw calls. Of course, if you have a QuickDraw version of your code<br>
you can easily work around this. 
</p>
<p>
Your program may have a different look and feel than a standard Macintosh application.<br>
In the case of video games and other animation packages, this may be OK . But if you're<br>
writing the next- generation word processor or spreadsheet application, you should be<br>
using QuickDraw, the Window Manager, and the Palette Manager. You lose all or most<br>
of these user interface managers if you write directly to the screen. Do your writing to<br>
the screen within a window; this will lessen the user interface impact. If you want to<br>
take over the entire screen, open a window that covers the entire screen.
</p>
<p>
Your program will also need to know when it's running in the background (see<i>Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i> Volume VI, page 5-19). When you're in the background, other applications'<br>
windows may be covering your window. In this case, you<i>must</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;use QuickDraw to<br>
refresh your window when you get an update event. If you write directly to the screen,<br>
you may clobber the foreground application's window.
</p>
<p>
<b>FEELIN' THE NEED FOR SPEED</b><br>
Writing directly to the screen for faster animation or graphics means a lot of work for<br>
you, because it will be up to your programming skills to beat QuickDraw. QuickDraw<br>
does everything possible to be as fast as it can while still being very generic. Efficient<br>
use of QuickDraw may actually eliminate the need to write to the screen. 
</p>
<p>
If you write specialized code that's tailored specifically for the kinds of images and<br>
graphics that your application deals with, you might be able to make it faster than<br>
QuickDraw. The routine presented at the end of this column, which simply draws a<br>
color icon, is about 50% faster than CopyBits. It was timed on a Macintosh LC II at<br>
1221 frames per second. CopyBits came in at a relatively sluggish 579frames per<br>
second. The timing was done by taking the average number of frames per second for<br>
100 seconds. 
</p>
<p>
Our routine is faster because it doesn't make any of the extra checks that QuickDraw<br>
must make to work with different bit depths and color environments. This routine is<br>
also coded to copy an image of a specific size, while CopyBits is a generic bit copier. 
</p>
<p>
Writing directly to the screen doesn't guarantee that you'll be faster than QuickDraw.<br>
Even if your code is good, under some circumstances QuickDraw may outperform you.<br>
If there's an accelerator in the system, you may not be able to beat QuickDraw at all.<br>
Also, CopyBits is more efficient when copying large images, because the overhead is a<br>
smaller part of the overall work. 
</p>
<p>
Increasing drawing speed enhances certain special effects. Not only can you gain<br>
smoother animation, but you also may be able to perform complex transformations,<br>
such as rotating 3-D shapes, and photo-realistic shading, which QuickDraw can't do.<br>
And you can do it with a high animation frame rate. For applications such as games,<br>
increased drawing speed and improved special effects are essential. 
</p>
<p>
The table below shows the trade-off between image size and drawing speed, comparing<br>
writing directly to the screen, QuickDraw CopyBits, and CopyBits in QuickDraw<br>
accelerated by an 8*24 GC card. We copied an 8-bit color image from an offscreen<br>
GWorld to the screen, on a Macintosh IIfx with System 7.0.1.

<p>
<b>GETTING READY</b><br>
Before you venture into video memory, you should do a few things to prepare for<br>
writing directly to the screen. Your program should determine the pixel depth and<br>
open a window to draw into.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, for maximum performance under System 7,<br>
you may want to kill all applications in the background. 
</p>
<p>
To beat QuickDraw, your code should be tailored for a specific pixel depth. Your<br>
program should find the pixel depth of the screen it's writing to by accessing the<br>
screen's GDevice.gdPMap.pixelSize field. If the depth is different from the depth that<br>
your program expects, you should ask the user's permission to change the pixel depth,<br>
and then change it using SetDepth (<i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume VI, page 21-23).
</p>
<p>
You<i> must</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;open a window to cover the part of the screen you're drawing on. If you don't<br>
use a window, update events for applications in the background may interfere with<br>
your graphics. 
</p>
<p>
If you require maximum performance, and you don't want any applications taking away<br>
your cycles at WaitNextEvent time, you may want to consider using the System 7<br>
Process Manager to kill all the background applications. If you do this, you should ask<br>
the user's permission first. Your users will no longer be able to access any desk<br>
accessories, which require the Finder to launch. There's an example of killing the<br>
background applications, called KillEveryOneButMe, on the<i>Developer CD Series disc</i> in<br>
the Snippets folder.
</p>
<p>
<b>REACHING FIRST BASE</b><br>
To access video memory, you need the base address of the video buffer for the screen to<br>
which you're writing. Depending on the version of QuickDraw installed, you'll need to<br>
use a different method of getting the base address. Use the Gestalt function with the<br>
gestaltQuickdrawVersion selector to determine the QuickDraw version.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're running on a system with the original black-and-white<br>
QuickDraw, which has a Gestalt result of gestaltOriginalQDxx, you can access<br>
the address of the screen by using the QuickDraw global variable<br>
screenBits.baseAddr.</li>
<li>If you're running Color QuickDraw, which has a Gestalt result of<br>
gestalt8BitQD, you can get the base address of the screen you're drawing on<br>
from the baseAddr field of the GDevice's pixMap.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should leave the<br>
addressing mode alone. </li>
<li>If you're running 32-Bit QuickDraw, which has a Gestalt result of<br>
gestalt32BitQDxx, you can get the 32-bit-clean base address of the screen's<br>
video memory by calling GetPixBaseAddr on the screen's GDevice's pixMap.<br>
Before you begin writing to the screen, you'll need to shift to 32-bit<br>
addressing mode to access video memory (see SwapMMUMode,<i>Inside Macintosh</i><br>
Volume V, page 593). After you change the addressing mode, you can't make<br>
any Toolbox or OS calls until you switch back, because they all expect to be<br>
called with the addressing mode established when the Macintosh was booted.<br>
Also, if you're changing modes from 24 bit to 32 bit, you should call<br>
StripAddress on any master pointers that may be dereferenced in 32-bit<br>
mode, because the high byte may contain garbage.</li>
</ul>
<p>
On multiple-monitor systems, you have to decide whether you want your windows to<br>
be on any of the additional screens. If you decide to allow users to drag your window to<br>
other monitors, you should get the base address from the monitor that the window is<br>
on. See Graphical Truffles in<i>develop</i> Issue 10 for a discussion of multiple monitors,<br>
including code. 
</p>
<p>
<b>PIXEL ACCESS</b><br>
Now that you have the base address of video memory, you need to know how to get to a<br>
pixel. To access a pixel within video memory, you need to translate the screen<br>
coordinate into a byte address. 
</p>
<p>
To map the vertical coordinate, multiply it by the rowBytes and add this product to the<br>
base address of the screen's video memory; this gives you the row address. To map the<br>
horizontal coordinate, calculate the byte number and add it to the row address.<br>
Voil&agrave;! You now have the pixel address. 
</p>
<p>
Below is a formula to translate a pixel coordinate into a pixel address. We leave it up<br>
to you to implement these formulas in the most efficient way for the graphics you're<br>
working with. 
</p>
<pre>rowAddr = screenBaseAddr + (rowBytes
                * pixel_vertical_coordinate);
if (pixel_depth &lt; 8) {
    pixels_per_byte = 8/pixel_depth;
    byteNum = pixel_horizontal_coordinate
                / pixels_per_byte;
}
else {
    bytes_per_pixel = pixel_depth/8;
    byteNum = pixel_horizontal_coordinate
                * bytes_per_pixel;
}
pixelAddr = rowAddr + byteNum;</pre>
<p>
For the example at the end of this column, we use the formula for a pixel depth of 8<br>
because it's the simplest. In this case, the above calculations can be reduced to
</p>
<pre>rowAddr = screenBaseAddr + (rowBytes * pixel_vertical_coordinate);
pixelAddr = rowAddr + pixel_horizontal_coordinate;</pre>
<p>
<b>MOUSETRAP</b><br>
You must call ShieldCursor (<i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume I, page 474) before you actually<br>
start writing to video memory. If you don't call ShieldCursor, your application will<br>
not be compatible with some third-party monitors. Also, if you don't have the cursor<br>
hidden and the mouse is moving over an area as you draw to it, the mouse will leave<br>
behind "serially repeating artifacts" (garbage). When you're done writing to video<br>
memory, call ShowCursor (<i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume I, page 168) to reverse the<br>
effects of ShieldCursor. 
</p>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>Writing directly to the screen is risky because the Macintosh hardware<br>
or OS may change in the future; Apple makes no guarantee that these methods will<br>
always work. In writing directly to the screen, you'll sacrifice the services of many<br>
Toolbox managers. For mainstream applications, QuickDraw's speed and flexibility<br>
will suffice. But for certain applications, such as games and animation, writing<br>
directly to the screen may provide an extra competitive edge. 
</p>
<p>
<b>AN EXAMPLE</b><br>
Below is a sample function, DirectPlotColorIcon, that draws an 8-bit color icon (an<br>
'icl8' resource) to an 8-bit color screen device whose pixMap is passed. 
</p>
<pre>void DirectPlotColorIcon(long *colorIconPtr,
    PixMapHandle screenPixMap, short row, short col)
{
    register long *screenMemPtr;   // Pointer to video memory
    register short numRowsToCopy;  // Rows we're going to copy
    register short stripRowBytes;  // To clear high bit of rowBytes
    register short rowLongsOffset; // rowBytes converted to long
    char    mmuMode;               // 32-bit mode required
    Rect    cursRect;              // Rectangle for ShieldCursor call
    Point cursOffset;              // 0,0 to indicate rect is in
                                   // global coordinates

    /* High bit of pixMap rowBytes must be cleared. */
    stripRowBytes = (0x7FFF &amp; (**screenPixMap).rowBytes);

    /* Strip high byte of icon address to prevent bus error */
    /* in 24-bit mode. */
    colorIconPtr = (long *)StripAddress(colorIconPtr);
    /* Calculate the address of the first byte of the */
    /* destination. */
    screenMemPtr = (long *)(GetPixBaseAddr(screenPixMap) +
        (stripRowBytes * row) + col);

    /* Call ShieldCursor to maintain compatibility with all */
    /* displays. */
    cursRect.top = row;
    cursRect.left = col;
    cursRect.bottom = row + 32;
    cursRect.right = col + 32;
    cursOffset.h = 0;
    cursOffset.v = 0;
    ShieldCursor(&amp;cursRect, cursOffset);

    /* Change to 32-bit addressing mode to access video memory. */
    /* The previous addressing mode is returned in mmuMode for */
    /* restoring later. */
    mmuMode = true32b;
    SwapMMUMode(&amp;mmuMode);
   
    /* Color icons have 32 rows. */
    numRowsToCopy = 32;
   
    /* Calculate the long word offset from the end of one row of */
    /* the color icon on the screen's pixMap to the first byte of */
    /* the icon in the next row. */
    rowLongsOffset = (stripRowBytes/4) - 8;
   
    /* Draw the color icon directly to the screen. */
    do {
            *screenMemPtr++ = *colorIconPtr++;
            *screenMemPtr++ = *colorIconPtr++;
            *screenMemPtr++ = *colorIconPtr++;
            *screenMemPtr++ = *colorIconPtr++;
            *screenMemPtr++ = *colorIconPtr++;
            *screenMemPtr++ = *colorIconPtr++;
            *screenMemPtr++ = *colorIconPtr++;
            *screenMemPtr++ = *colorIconPtr++;
   
        /* Bump to start of next row. */
            screenMemPtr += rowLongsOffset;
    } while(--numRowsToCopy);
   
    /* Restore addressing mode back to what it was. */
    SwapMMUMode(&amp;mmuMode);

    ShowCursor();
