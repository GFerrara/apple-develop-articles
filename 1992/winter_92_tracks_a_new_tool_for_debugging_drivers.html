<h2>TRACKS: A NEW TOOL FOR DEBUGGING DRIVERS</h2>
<h1>BRAD LOWE</h1>
<p>
<img src="img/137.gif" width="365 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;Here's a tool that gives you access to what you really need to know while debugging a</i><br>
<i>driver. With Tracks, you decide what kind of information you want to track-- variable</i><br>
<i>contents, who called the current function, timing information, and more--all while</i><br>
<i>your driver's running. When a problem arises, you can easily tell where your</i><br>
<i>driver's been and what it's been doing, so you can find out just what went wrong.</i>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;If you've ever written a device driver, you know how hard it is to keep track of what's<br>
going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning the value of variables and other data as the driver runs usually<br>
requires a lot of time in a debugger. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;When a driver crashes, trashing the stack in the process, it's often impossible to<br>
determine the last routine that was executed. Finding the bug can take many hours,<br>
especially if the crash appears only periodically. Even after you've found the bug, each<br>
crash requires recompiling, building, restarting, and retesting. Anything to help<br>
locate bugs more quickly and accurately could save a lot of time and frustration. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;That's why Tracks was written.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you're writing your first or your fiftieth<br>
driver, it can help you track down those nasty bugs that always show up. The simple<br>
macros in Tracks make it easy to log all kinds of information from a driver written in<br>
C or C++. You can record strings, data blocks, longs, and even formatted data types.<br>
Tracks can write debugging information directly to disk as it comes in, or it can keep<br>
the information in a circular buffer and dump it to disk on command--a MacsBug dcmd<br>
(debugger command) lets you do this even after a crash. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;You can completely control what information is logged, and your driver won't even<br>
know it. If you know a routine works, you can turn off calls from it at any time--<br>
including while your driver's running. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;On the<i>Developer CD Series</i> disc, you'll find TestDrvr, a sample driver that<br>
demonstrates how to implement Tracks functionality in a simple (and useless) driver.<br>
Also enclosed is the complete source for the Tracks utilities, as well as all the<br>
necessary support tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following sections, you'll find out about how Tracks<br>
works, what kind of information the Tracks macros log, and what the code does. You'll<br>
also get some pointers on installing and using Tracks. If you're eager to start using<br>
Tracks, take a look at "Tracks in Action."
</p>
<h2>HOW TRACKS WORKS</h2>
<p>
Tracks works somewhat like a message service that can accept telephone calls on 128<br>
different lines from the target driver. You decide where to install the lines and what<br>
kinds of messages each line will deliver. You can control which lines to listen to (or<br>
not) and where to save incoming messages. 
</p>
<p>
The invocations of macros--or calls--that send information to Tracks are<br>
called<i>tracepoints. </i> You assign each tracepoint a number between 0 and 127, called<br>
a<i>diagnostic ID (diagID),</i> and a name. The diagID represents one bit in a 128-bit flag<br>
that can be set or cleared from the Tracks control panel device (cdev). When a<br>
tracepoint is encountered, data is logged only if the corresponding bit has been set. 
</p>
<p>
Being able to set or clear tracepoints on the fly allows you to tailor the type of<br>
information being traced. By assigning a meaningful name to each tracepoint, you'll<br>
know which ones to set or clear, and the name of the tracepoint will be recorded with<br>
any Tracks output. Tracks<i>breakpoints</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;are tracepoints that will drop you into your<br>
debugger. 
</p>
<p>
<b>GROUPING INFORMATION</b><br>
Because the diagID doesn't have to be unique, a tracepoint can represent a single Tracks<br>
call, a type of Tracks call, or a grouping of Tracks calls. A type of Tracks call, for<br>
instance, might be all error- reporting calls. A grouping might be all tracepoints in a<br>
particular routine. 
</p>
<p>
This kind of flexibility allows you to group your information into logical and<br>
functional units. It's up to you to create as many or as few tracepoints as you need. For<br>
instance, if you're working on a new routine, you may set a whole bunch of Tracks<br>
calls all to the same diagID. When you test the routine, you can set some or all of the<br>
other switches to off and focus on the messages from that routine. Later, when you<br>
know the function works, you can keep that switch off. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Numbering for ease of use. </b>There aren't any limits on how you group your<br>
diagIDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;You might assign all messages to one tracepoint or simply start at 0 and<br>
increment by 1 from there. The key is that once you know something works, you want<br>
to be able to turn off tracing in that area. By assigning unique diagIDs to groups of<br>
Tracks calls, you can quickly tailor your tracing. 
</p>
<p>
For convenience, there are four groups of 32 tracepoints each (0-31, 32-63,<br>
64-95, and 96-127) that you can turn on or off with a click. (The Tracks cdev<br>
contains buttons for levels 1 through 4, which correspond to these four groups.) Most<br>
new users start out tracing all information. But as more and more Tracks output is<br>
added, information overload can be a problem, and it's great to be able to limit Tracks<br>
information easily. 
</p>
<p>
<i>PartCodes</i> are used to identify consecutive Tracks calls that have the same diagID.<br>
PartCodes should start at 0 and increment by 1 for each additional Tracks call with the<br>
same diagID. For example, say you wanted to dump the contents of all three parameters<br>
you receive on entry to a function. You'd probably want all these to have the same<br>
diagID. The first Tracks call should have a partCode of 0, the next call a partCode of 1,<br>
and so on. The partCode makes it more evident if some Tracks information is lost. Data<br>
can be lost if the circular buffer fills before writing to a file, and data can be locked<br>
out if Tracks is already in use. 
</p>
<h2>THE TRACKS MACROS</h2>
<p>
To log data from your driver, you call one of five simple macros from your driver<br>
code. Each macro logs a different kind of information. All the calls must have access to<br>
your driver's global storage and follow the numbering conventions just described for<br>
the diagID and partCode. 
</p>
<pre>T_STACK(diagID);</pre>
<p>
T_STACK, one of the most useful calls, records the current function and who called it.<br>
If the driver is written in C++, a special unmangler automatically prints out the<br>
arguments that were passed to the function. If called from every major routine,<br>
T_STACK will leave the proverbial trail of bread crumbs. T_STACK's partCode is<br>
always 0. 
</p>
<pre>T_DATA(diagID, partCode, &amp;dataBlock, sizeof(dataBlock));</pre>
<p>
T_DATA is used to dump a block of memory, formatted in hexadecimal and ASCII. 
</p>
<pre>T_TYPE(diagID, partCode, recordPtr, sizeof(Record), "\pRecord");</pre>
<p>
T_TYPE records a data structure. The address, size, and a Pascal string with the name<br>
of the structure must be passed to the macro. The format of the data structure must be<br>
defined in an 'mxwt' resource, stored in your driver or in your MacsBug Debugger<br>
Prefs file. If the resource to define the structure isn't found, the data will be treated as<br>
a T_DATA call. Since the templates are used only to format data, you don't need to use<br>
MacsBug. 
</p>
<pre>T_PSTR(diagID, partCode, "\pA string you'd like to see");</pre>
<p>
T_PSTR simply records a Pascal string. 
</p>
<pre>T_PSTRLONG(diagID, partCode, "\ptheLong = ", theLong);</pre>
<p>
T_PSTRLONG records a Pascal string and a long. Usually the string is used to tell you<br>
what follows. Feel free to cast whatever you can get away with to the long. 
</p>
<h2>TRACKS IN ACTION</h2>
<p>
TestDrvr is a simple driver skeleton that checks the status of the keyboard. If the<br>
Option key is down, it logs one type of data, and if the Command key is down, it logs<br>
another type of data.
</p>
<p>
To see Tracks in action, follow these condensed instructions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Put DumpTracks into your MPW Tools folder and TestDrvr into your<br>
System Folder or Extensions folder.</li>
<li>Put Tracks into your System Folder or, in System 7, into your Control<br>
Panels folder.</li>
<li>Restart your Macintosh.</li>
<li>Open the Tracks cdev, click the Driver Name button, and locate the file<br>
TestDrvr.</li>
<li>Turn on Tracks and click the Level 1 button to turn on tracepoints 0-31<br>
(only 0-3 are used).</li>
<li>Press the Command key or the Option key to begin to log data. The Bytes<br>
Buffered field should change.</li>
<li>Click Write Buffer to send TestDrvr output to disk. Only data written to<br>
disk can be examined.</li>
<li>Start up MPW and type "DumpTracks" to see what was just traced.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Look over the TestDrvr source code if you haven't already done so. Don't forget to<br>
remove TestDrvr when you're done. For information about the output from the<br>
example, see the section "Examining Tracks Output" under "Using Tracks."
</p>
<h2>A LOOK AT THE TRACKS CODE</h2>
<p>
This section is for folks who are really wide awake and ready for the gritty details. (If<br>
you're not one of those folks, you may want to jump ahead to the "Installing Tracks"<br>
section.) The Tracks file contains a cdev, an INIT, and the Tracks driver. The Tracks<br>
driver has three key responsibilities: maintaining the cdev, sending messages to the<br>
target driver, and accepting data from the target driver via the trace procedure<br>
(TraceProc). Figure 1 shows the flow of data between Tracks and the target driver. 
</p>
<p>
<b>MAINTAINING THE CDEV</b><br>
The Tracks driver's first responsibility includes sending status information to the<br>
cdev and responding to cdev commands like "clear buffer" and "write file." Because the<br>
cdev displays the status of fields that can change at any time, the cdev monitors the<br>
driver and updates fields as they change. 
</p>
<p>
The Tracks driver doesn't always need periodic (accRun) messages. When the driver<br>
gets a message to turn its periodic write-to-file flag on or off, the driver sets or<br>
clears its dNeedTime bit in the dCtlFlags. (Recall that BitClr, BitSet, and BitTst test<br>
bits starting at the high-order bit.)
</p>
<pre>BitClr(&amp;dCtl-&gt;dCtlFlags, 2L);/* Clear bit 5 = dNeedTime bit. */
BitSet(&amp;dCtl-&gt;dCtlFlags, 2L);/* Set bit 5 = dNeedTime bit. */</pre>
<p>
<b>SENDING MESSAGES TO THE TARGET DRIVER</b><br>
The Tracks driver can send one of two messages to the target driver: "enable tracing"<br>
or "disable tracing." The enable message passes the target driver a function pointer<br>
that points to an address within the Tracks driver code as well as a pointer that points<br>
to the Tracks driver's own globals. The target driver needs to save both of these<br>
because they're needed by the Tracks macros. The macros use the function pointer to<br>
call the Tracks driver directly, passing it the globals pointer along with tracing data. 
</p>
<p>
When the target driver gets the disable message, the saved function pointer is set to<br>
nil. (For the code to handle enable and disable messages, see the "Installing Tracks"<br>
section.) The Tracks macros in the target driver check to see if the function pointer is<br>
nil, and if it isn't, the target driver calls the function pointer within Tracks with<br>
arguments that correspond to the particular Tracks function.&nbsp;&nbsp;The macro that checks<br>
and invokes a non-nil function pointer is defined in the following code. The macros<br>
used in the target driver's code reference this macro. Notice that for a Tracks call to<br>
compile, it needs to access your globals by the same name, in this case by the name<br>
<b>globals</b>. Macros are used so that they can easily be compiled out of the final product.

(globals-&gt;fTraceArg, diagID, partCode, formatID, \
data1, data2, data3); }</pre>
<p>
<b>ACCEPTING DATA FROM THE TARGET DRIVER</b><br>
The actual routine the macro executes, located in the Tracks driver, is shown below.<br>
The address of this routine was passed to the target driver in the enable message, and<br>
the first argument (long refcon) is actually the pointer to the Tracks driver's globals,<br>
which the Tracks driver expects the target driver to pass back to it each time. The<br>
macro calls right into the Tracks driver code. 
</p>
<pre>pascal void TraceProc(long refcon, unsigned char diagID,
    unsigned char partCode, unsigned char formatID, long data1,
    long data2, long data3)
{
register TraceGlobals       *globals;
register Boolean            okLocked;
register Boolean            breakOnExit = false;   

    globals = (TraceGlobals *)refcon;   // Set up driver globals.

    if (diagID &lt; 128)        // Valid diagIDs range from 0 to 127.
    {  
        // Check the need for a break on exit (breakpoint was set).
        breakOnExit = BitTst((Ptr)globals-&gt;fBreakMask, (long)diagID);
               
        // Check to see if the information passed should be logged.
        if (BitTst((Ptr)globals-&gt;fTraceMask, (long)diagID))
        {
            // The tracepoint was set--check that the buffer is ready.
            if (globals-&gt;fBufferEnabled)     // Is the buffer ready?
            { 
                // Test and set "locked-out" flag.
                okLocked = UTLock(&amp;globals-&gt;fTraceLock);

                // If trace request was locked out, set locked-out
                // flag.
                if (okLocked)
                    // Log incoming data to circular buffer.
                    HandleTraceData(globals, diagID, partCode,
                        formatID, data1, data2, data3);
                else
                    globals-&gt;fLockedOutFlag = true; // Locked out!
            }
        }
    }
       
// Handle a breakpoint, if any.
    if (breakOnExit)
    {
        // We can assume there's a debugger installed.
        if (globals-&gt;fBreakOnceThenClear)
        {
            BitClr((Ptr)globals-&gt;fBreakMask,(long)diagID);
            // Signal cdev that debug mark was turned off.
            globals-&gt;fDebugMarkUnset = true;
            DebugStr("\pTrace User Breakpoint (Once)");
        }
        else
            DebugStr("\pTrace User Breakpoint");
    }
    return;
}</pre>
<p>
The above routine checks to see if the diagID specified is enabled (checked in the cdev).<br>
If it is, HandleTraceData handles the data passed in the way indicated by the formatID.<br>
The formatID specifies what type of data is being passed--a Pascal string, a Pascal<br>
string and a long, a data block, a stack peek request, or a formatted type dump.<br>
Adventurous programmers<i>could</i> add their own formats (for instance, to record<br>
floating-point numbers) by modifying the HandleTraceData routine and DumpTracks<br>
and then creating a new macro. Adding a new format isn't trivial, though. Usually, it's<br>
easier to make an existing format do the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this routine can be called at<br>
interrupt time, it needs to test and set a "locked-out" flag, which it does with an<br>
assembly language routine called UTLock that uses the 68000's BSET instruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
BSET helps ensure that the routine won't get into trouble by executing more than one<br>
instance of itself. If the routine gets locked out, DumpTracks will notify you that some<br>
data was lost. 
</p>
<p>
The routine also checks to see if a breakpoint has been set for that diagID. If it has,<br>
just before the routine exits, it invokes the debugger. Two kinds of breakpoints are<br>
supported--"once-only" and "immortal." The once-only kind of breakpoint flag is<br>
cleared after being tripped. Tracks breakpoints can be cleared or set only through the<br>
Tracks cdev--not from your debugger. 
</p>
<p>
An interesting routine in drvr.c is StackPeek, which is called by T_STACK macros.<br>
StackPeek examines the stack frame to find what the current procedure is and who<br>
called it. StackPeek searches backward until it finds the return address of the function<br>
that called T_STACK. From there, it searches the actual code, looking for the last<br>
instruction (an RTS, a JMP(A0), or an RTD), which is followed by the name of the<br>
function. It then finds the length of the function name and repeats the process for the<br>
caller, which is just one stack frame deeper. 
</p>
<h2>INSTALLING TRACKS</h2>
<p>
The following are instructions for adding Tracks capabilities to a driver written in C<br>
or C++.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently the only way to view Tracks output is through the DumpTracks<br>
MPW tool.
</p>
<ol>
<li> Install the Tracks files on your hard drive. Put a copy of Tracks into your<br>
System Folder or, in System 7, into your Control Panels folder. Put<br>
DumpTracks into your MPW Tools folder and add the 'dcmd' resource in<br>
Tracks.dcmd to your Debugger Prefs. Finally, make a copy of TracksInfo.h and<br>
put it with your driver code. </li>
<li> Add two variables to your driver's global storage area. These must be<br>
accessible from every place you want to trace from. You may need to redo your<br>
globals so that these variables are always able to be accessed in the same way.<br>
The globals should look like this:

<pre> typedef struct
{
   </pre>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;your stuff</i>
</p>
<pre> ProcPtr fTraceProcPtr;
Ptr fTraceArg;
} Globals, *GlobalsPtr;</pre>
</li>
<li>In your initialization routine, you'll need to set the fTraceProcPtr to nil. 

<pre> globals-&gt;fTraceProcPtr = nil;</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;Tracks calls attempted before this is done will result in fireworks. If your<br>
driver's global storage isn't referenced by a parameter called<b>globals</b>, you can<br>
change the word "globals" in the file TracksInfo.h to whatever the global<br>
storage is referenced by. The Tracks macros require you to be consistent in<br>
your global storage references. 
</p>
</li>
<li>Include TracksInfo.h in the header file where you define your global<br>
storage block. </li>
<li>Add two csCodes to your driver's code. They need to look like this:

<pre>case kInstallTrace:
globals-&gt;fTraceProcPtr = ((TraceDataPtr)paramPtr)-&gt;TraceProc;
globals-&gt;fTraceArg = ((TraceDataPtr)paramPtr)-&gt;TraceGlobals;
break;

case kRemoveTrace: globals-&gt;fTraceProcPtr = nil;
globals-&gt;fTraceArg = nil;
break;</pre>
</li>
<li>Add two resources to your driver's .r or .rsrc file: 'DrvN' and 'STR#'.

<p>
&nbsp;Resource 'DrvN' ID 128 contains a Pascal string with the name of your driver<br>
(which starts with a period). The 'DrvN' resource lets the cdev know which<br>
driver to send the "turn on" and "turn off" messages to. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Resource 'STR#' ID 777 is a string list that should contain the names of<br>
tracepoints you create. It's for the tracepoint names in the cdev and for<br>
DumpTracks output--not for use by your driver. The 'STR#' resource can be<br>
partially filled, blank, or even missing. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;When you add a Tracks call with a new diagID, you'll want to give it a name<br>
and add it to the string list. Changes show up the next time the cdev is opened<br>
or DumpTracks is used. If the 'STR#' resource is missing, the tracepoint name<br>
will show up in the cdev as a number--the diagID. DumpTracks will warn you<br>
when there's no name associated with the diagID. 
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;Warning:</i> The diagIDs range from 0 to 127, and in ResEdit the string list is<br>
set up to start at 1. This means that if you add a Tracks call with a new diagID<br>
of 5, you need to change entry number 6 in the string list. </li></ol>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Add a few Tracks macros to your code, rebuild your driver, and you're set to start<br>
using Tracks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you're ready to ship your driver, simply #define GOLD in<br>
TracksInfo.h and remove the two Tracks resources and any 'mxwt' resources from<br>
your driver. 
</p>
<h2>USING TRACKS</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;Tracks can be controlled via dcmd or cdev. The dcmd lets you turn tracing on and off<br>
and write the circular buffer to disk. The Tracks cdev, shown in Figure 2, lets you<br>
control all the Tracks functions. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/139.gif" width="369 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 2</b> A Look at the Tracks cdev
</p>
<p>
<b>TRACING AND SETTING TRACEPOINTS</b><br>
To begin tracing data, open the cdev, click the Driver Name button, and select a driver<br>
that has Tracks code installed at the Standard File prompt. If the target driver is set up<br>
properly, you'll see the name of the driver next to the button. To turn on tracing, click<br>
the On button and check the tracepoints you want traced. Tracepoints are represented<br>
by the list of 128 checkboxes. As soon as information is retrieved, the number in the<br>
Bytes Buffered field will change. To stop sending data to Tracks, click the Off button. 
</p>
<p>
<b>SETTING BREAKPOINTS</b><br>
To set breakpoints from Tracks, either click in the Tracks cdev just to the left of the<br>
scroll bar, opposite the desired tracepoint, or Option-click a checkbox. A tiny bug will<br>
appear, indicating a breakpoint. When a breakpoint is hit, you'll need to step a few<br>
times to return from the Tracks code to your driver. Since the default type of<br>
breakpoint is once-only, a breakpoint must be reset each time after it's encountered. 
</p>
<p>
<b>SETTING THE BUFFER</b><br>
Like all good circular buffers, the Tracks buffer will hold the most current data. The<br>
default (and minimum) setting is 4K. If you want to change this size, you need to turn<br>
off Tracks and clear the contents of the buffer before clicking the arrows button.<br>
Generally, it's better to have a large buffer if you can afford it. But if you aren't<br>
logging a lot of data, and periodic write-to-file is turned on, you can have a small<br>
buffer and not lose any information. 
</p>
<p>
An excellent use of the circular buffer is to catch sporadic bugs that might not occur<br>
for hours (or days). For example, set up a test to run continuously until the problem<br>
is detected. Plan to let the test run over the weekend with write-to-file turned off.<br>
When you come in on Monday, the circular buffer will have the last 4K of data--or<br>
whatever size buffer you used--leading up to and including the occurrence of the<br>
problem. 
</p>
<p>
<b>WRITING THE BUFFER</b><br>
Before you can examine any Tracks data, you need to send it to a file by clicking the<br>
Write Buffer button. To clear the file, click the Reset EOF button. The data is always<br>
written to the Tracks Prefs file, which hangs out in your System Folder or, in System<br>
7, in your Preferences folder. Use the Reset EOF button instead of throwing the Tracks<br>
Prefs file away, since settings information is also stored there. 
</p>
<p>
If you check the Periodic Write-To-File box, data will be written to the disk<br>
approximately every second (60 ticks), assuming there's data to send. Be forewarned<br>
that data can come out at an alarming clip--in minutes you can create a multimegabyte<br>
file. The periodic writes-to-file occur even when the cdev is closed, until you turn it<br>
off or your hard drive becomes full. 
</p>
<p>
If your driver crashes, you can write the circular buffer to disk via the Tracks dcmd.<br>
Just type "Tracks write" from your dcmd-supporting debugger. 
</p>
<p>
<b>EXAMINING TRACKS OUTPUT</b><br>
Once data has been written to your Tracks Prefs file, you can examine it using<br>
DumpTracks. Figure 3 shows a sample (from the TestDrvr example) of a couple of<br>
simple Tracks calls and the type of output you'll get. Notice that each routine that<br>
wants to use a Tracks macro needs to have a pointer to the globals passed as an<br>
argument with the same name--in this case,<b>globals</b>. 
</p>
<p>
The first line of a record holds a time stamp. Because other calls with the same diagID<br>
will follow immediately, it's shown only when the partCode is 0. 
</p>
<p>
The second line shows the diagID and the name of the corresponding tracepoint, shown<br>
in parentheses. 
</p>
<p>
The "(diagID - partCode) TYPE_OF_TRACE" line (the third line) is followed by the<br>
data for that Tracks call.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Figure 3</b>Comparing Tracks Output With the Calls

Notice that the T_TYPE call formats the contents of the driver's DCtlEntry. To be able<br>
to display formatted types, DumpTracks needs to read the 'mxwt' format from<br>
Debugger Prefs. Also notice that the DCtlEntry has a QHdr structure inside it, which<br>
was also displayed.

<h2>ON YOUR OWN</h2>
<p>
Debugging a device driver can be time consuming and difficult. Tracks provides you<br>
with a tool to help keep your drivers under control. How you set up tracing really<br>
depends on what kinds of things you'd like to monitor--error conditions, your own<br>
driver statistics, or whatever. If you suspect bugs will be, or are, a major source of<br>
headaches, you'll save time by adding lots of Tracks calls. 
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the TestDrvr sample source code. Once you get Tracks going in your own<br>
code, you should find that you're debugging your drivers in a fraction of the time it<br>
used to take. 
</p>
<h2>SOME HELP WITH TERMS</h2>
<p>
<b><i>breakpoint</i></b><b> </b> A tracepoint that enters your debugger.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>diagnostic ID (diagID)</i></b><b> </b> A number between 0 and 127 that represents one bit in a<br>
128-bit flag. In Tracks, a diagID is assigned to a tracepoint. The flag determines<br>
whether trace data will be logged or not. A diagID can represent a single Tracks call or<br>
a grouping of calls.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>DumpTracks</i></b><b> </b> An MPW tool that lets you see Tracks output.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>partCode</i></b><b> </b> A number used to identify consecutive Tracks calls that have the same<br>
diagID.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>tracepoint</i></b><b> </b> An invocation of a macro in your driver code that sends out information<br>
to the Tracks driver.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Tracks</i></b><b> </b> A programming utility--containing the Tracks cdev, INIT, and driver--used<br>
to debug drivers in development.
