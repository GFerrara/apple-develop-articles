LETTERS<br>
<p>
<b>PROVINCIALISM</b><br>
I would be pleased if Apple (and APDA, etc.) would cease dating publications by what<br>
would seem to be the season in the northern hemisphere (for example, "Winter<br>
1992"). This practice is inconsistent with Apple's dedication to Worldwide Software<br>
and the avoidance of cultural values. In addition to it being ignorant and arrogant, it is<br>
both confused and confusing--the seasons in the U.S.A. are not, I believe, simply the<br>
opposite of ours.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, what the heck is "Winter 1992"? Which end of the year is it? Is it<br>
sometimes also known as "Winter 1991"?<br>
--Dr. Ross L. Richardson, Australia
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for the kick in the pants--and for inspiring the theme of this issue's editorial.</i><br>
<i>The change (back) to using months has been made in this, our May issue. I wish we</i><br>
<i>could have done it for Issue 9 (February, a.k.a. Winter 1992), because I agree that</i><br>
<i>"Winter" is particularly confusing, but the timing was too tricky. In fact, just after</i><br>
<i>hearing from you about this, I received a "Winter 1991" catalog in the mail!</i><br>

<p>
<b>WHERE'S THE SKB STACK?</b><br>
Wow, a real Developer CD! At first I thought it was one of those errors that are in my<br>
favor (a rarity for sure!). But no, I will continue to receive Developer CDs. Last year<br>
I would have considered murder to gain access to one of these.
</p>
<p>
Needless to say I've been over it as much as possible. There's one thing that I can't find.<br>
I can't seem to locate the Search Knowledge Base stack. I was able to select which stacks<br>
to search and get the report of all Tech Notes containing what I was looking for. I don't<br>
mind telling you that it saved my butt on a couple of contracts. I've looked in the logical<br>
places on the CD for it. Where is it?<br>
--J. R. Hughson
</p>
<p>
<i>Yes, since Issue 8, subscribers to develop have been getting the entire Developer CD</i><br>
<i>Series disc and not just the Developer Essentials subset. Truly the bargain of the</i><br>
<i>century (tell your friends). We're glad you didn't have to resort to foul play to get one.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The Search Knowledge Base (SKB) stack was modified slightly and integrated into the</i><br>
<i>Developer Info Assistant (DIA) stack-- so it was only hiding, not gone. We apologize</i><br>
<i>for not communicating this change to you. To go directly to the SKB utility, just open</i><br>
<i>the DIA stack (in the Start Here folder) and click the "Search..." button.</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>ON LOCATION (MOOF!)</b><br>
It was nice to get more goodies on the CD that came with Issue 8, but the CD has a<br>
couple of deficiencies that I think should have been detected/eliminated.
</p>
<p>
1. Unless something is wrong with my copy of On Location, the On Location index on the<br>
CD can't be used to view the files it references. On Location says that the index is out of<br>
date. I don't know about all files, but this was true of the sample I tried to look at. To<br>
rebuild the index on my hard disk will take a big chunk of my limited hard disk space.
</p>
<p>
2. The time I spent with the CD from&nbsp;&nbsp;develop Issue 7 getting accustomed to the Search<br>
Knowledge Base stack was for naught since SKB is not present on the CD that came with<br>
Issue 8. The old version does not work on the new CD without substantial modification.<br>
I found Issue 7's SKB very useful.
</p>
<p>
By the way, what does "Moof!" mean?<br>
--Pete Roberts
</p>
<p>
<i>The On Location index was indeed broken on the Developer CD Series disc Volume X. Our</i><br>
<i>apologies, and thanks for alerting us. It works fine on later CDs.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>As for the apparent disappearance of the Search Knowledge Base (SKB) stack,&nbsp;&nbsp;please</i><br>
<i>see the answer to the previous question.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Moof is a sacred tradition among Apple's Developer Technical Support engineers. It</i><br>
<i>means several things. First, it's the sound that the dogcow makes. (The story of the</i><br>
<i>dogcow is "hidden" in Macintosh Technical Note #31 on the CD; if you can find it,</i><br>
<i>you'll be considered a Moof initiate.) The dogcow is integrated into our artwork in a</i><br>
<i>number of places. Take a look at the cover card of the Technical Notes stack or Q &amp; A</i><br>
<i>stack, for example. There's also a guest appearance of the dogcow in this issue of </i><br>
<i>develop (see the Print Hints column).</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Second, the word is used to indicate any software that's a hack, something untested and</i><br>
<i>on the edge. Certain folders on the CD are marked Moof, such as "Tools &amp; Apps (Moof!)"</i><br>
<i>and "Development Platforms (Moof!)." This is to let you know that these folders</i><br>
<i>contain software that's not fully tested or sanctioned by the powers that be. When you</i><br>
<i>open these folders you cross the boundary into hackerland.</i><br>
<i>--Sharon Flowers</i>

<b>QUICKTIME MOVIES ON THE CD?</b><br>
I want to thank you and your staff for a truly wonderful publication. I currently hold a<br>
dual position as a Macintosh/ Windows developer and as director of a research lab<br>
using UNIX &#174; boxes with Motif; of all the trade magazines I get (and let me tell you, I<br>
get a zillion of them),&nbsp;&nbsp;develop shines above all the rest. The articles addressed aren't<br>
always the ones I'd have chosen, but with as large an audience as you probably have,<br>
you still manage to print more than enough for me to get plenty out of each issue.
</p>
<p>
The CD has also provided me with hours of exploration each time. I would really like to<br>
see you include QuickTime movies made by Apple employees and maybe even readers.
</p>
<p>
Keep up the good work--and treat yourselves to pizza on me (send the bill to my<br>
mailing address).<br>
--Robert H. Zakon
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for the glowing comments. You have no idea (or maybe you do) how much these</i><br>
<i>things mean to us.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Regarding QuickTime movies on the CD, I agree that would be great, sorta like the old</i><br>
<i>days when we had an audio track on every CD: our chance to get creative and add some</i><br>
<i>entertainment value. Unfortunately, it's unlikely that it will happen, for a few</i><br>
<i>reasons. The main one is that we'd have to get rid of a lot of useful stuff to make room</i><br>
<i>for the movies (which, as I'm sure you know, tend to be largish). Even though we have</i><br>
<i>600 MB of space on the disc, it's always burstingly full.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>So despite the fun we could all have with movies, the Developer CD is just not the place</i><br>
<i>for them, alas. The QuickTime CD is, of course, chock full of fun movies, if you haven't</i><br>
<i>seen it yet. It's available from APDA as part of the QuickTime Developer's Kit, APDA</i><br>
<i>#R0147LL/A.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks again for writing, and if you have ideas for articles you'd like to see (or want</i><br>
<i>to write one yourself!), please don't hesitate to let us know.</i><br>
<i>--Dave Johnson</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>P.S. The pizza was delicious. All 114 of us thank you heartily. The bill is in the mail.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>NOT READY FOR PAPERLESS</b><br>
I'm more concerned about the environment than most, but the race to achieve the<br>
paperless office, without determining what people's needs really are, will only end up<br>
convincing them that the electronic office has not come of age! Apple isn't considering<br>
that we've spent most of our lives looking at the printed page, so the productivity loss<br>
now in using on-line electronic media is high.
</p>
<p>
The fact is most people relate more easily and absorb information more quickly from<br>
the printed page than from any existing on-line method. A case in point is develop.<br>
Scanning Issue 8 on-line took more than 30 minutes, just for a quick scan.
</p>
<p>
An equal amount of information could have been obtained from the printed magazine in<br>
less than 1 minute. That's a factor of 30!
</p>
<p>
I applaud the effort to save trees, but how many trees are being saved when developers<br>
merely print the information themselves (single-sided, I might add)? If Apple wants<br>
to make an impact in this area of environmental concern I suggest they provide a set of<br>
integrated on-line tools that allow retrieval of information in a way that's more<br>
human oriented. Apple held a carrot under our noses at the 1991 Worldwide<br>
Developers Conference called BlueNote, but they've been unable to deliver. In the<br>
meantime we're expected to make do with the existing (poor) HyperCard &#174; utilities.<br>
Come on, Apple--now is the time to make a difference.<br>
--Todd Stanley
</p>
<p>
<i>I couldn't agree with you more that Apple needs to develop an electronic publishing</i><br>
<i>strategy that advances the art of access to information. But Apple is many people and</i><br>
<i>consensus is somewhat of an endangered species! Current strategies, electronic develop</i><br>
<i>included, do make some advances. Regretfully, in some ways they are more difficult to</i><br>
<i>use than the tried-and-true print media.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>But beyond regret and apologies we actually have some solutions in the works. The</i><br>
<i>"BlueNote" carrot that was dangled before you is in fact now in use on the Developer</i><br>
<i>CD. It's being used to present chapters from the new, improved Inside Macintosh.</i><br>
<i>Unfortunately, like most solutions to date, it creates as many problems as it solves. So</i><br>
<i>please be patient as we try to come up with a solution that does the electronic medium</i><br>
<i>justice.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>As a side note: This discussion should send a message to the developer community.</i><br>
<i>There's clearly a need in the marketplace for generic electronic publishing tools. And</i><br>
<i>where there is a need, there is opportunity.</i><br>
<i>--Corey Vian</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>WHERE'S PRINTED DEVELOP?</b><br>
I'm an Apple Associate and lately I have not been receiving the printed version of <br>
develop magazine. Issue 7 was the last printed one I received. I don't know why this<br>
happened, but I would like to receive the printed version again.
</p>
<p>
The CD-ROM paperless approach is admirable, but it doesn't work for me because I do<br>
all my reading while commuting on CalTrain.<br>
--Joe Zuffoletto
</p>
<p>
<i>Letters like yours are all too common. What's happened is that, starting with Issue 8,</i><br>
<i>printed&nbsp;&nbsp;develop was removed from the mailing to Apple Associates and Partners. In</i><br>
<i>various places (including in the mailing itself), it was announced that developers</i><br>
<i>would have to explicitly subscribe to keep getting&nbsp;&nbsp;develop in printed form-- but</i><br>
<i>apparently many developers didn't see this announcement. Since then we've received a</i><br>
<i>lot of less-than-positive feedback about the decision to drop the printed magazine out</i><br>
<i>of the mailing and about the difficulties in trying to read it on the CD (see, for</i><br>
<i>example, the previous letter). The paperless approach isn't working for a lot of</i><br>
<i>people, as it turns out.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>For now, you'll have to subscribe in order to get printed&nbsp;&nbsp;develop. If you don't want to</i><br>
<i>go through the trouble of finding the subscription form in&nbsp;&nbsp;develop on-line, you can</i><br>
<i>place a phone order at 1-800-877-5548--or you can subscribe through APDA.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>As for the future, rest assured that Apple is paying attention to the feedback and has</i><br>
<i>learned a lot from it. I can't say what will happen, but I know that the more developers</i><br>
<i>tell us what they want, the more likely they are to get it. So thanks for writing to us.</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>UP TO HIS EARS IN CDS</b><br>
I agree 105% with your editorial comment in Issue 8 (about preferring to read <br>
develop in printed form). I guess I'll cast my vote by subscribing to&nbsp;&nbsp;develop, but I<br>
need another copy of the CD like I need a typewriter. I sometimes wonder whether I<br>
should still keep all the old CDs that compete for room in my limited collection space. I<br>
want the hard copy&nbsp;&nbsp;develop, but it bothers me to waste that CD that comes with it.<br>
--Bruce Radford
</p>
<p>
<i>Apple Associates and Partners who subscribe to&nbsp;&nbsp;develop to get it in hard copy do end up</i><br>
<i>with an extra CD. At one time I was concerned about the extra cost of this as well as the</i><br>
<i>waste. It turns out that the CD doesn't add much at all to the cost of&nbsp;&nbsp;develop. But as for</i><br>
<i>the waste, I don't have an answer; maybe some of our readers do?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I wouldn't recommend holding on to the old CDs (which only compounds your disposal</i><br>
<i>problem, but oh well). For the most part they're cumulative--we've only deleted old</i><br>
<i>versions of international system software and a few other things that we had pressing</i><br>
<i>reasons to remove. In particular, the&nbsp;&nbsp;develop code on the CD is kept up-to-date, and</i><br>
<i>any bugs are fixed, with each new CD.</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>
</p>
<p>
PLEASE WRITE! We welcome timely letters to the editors, especially from readers<br>
