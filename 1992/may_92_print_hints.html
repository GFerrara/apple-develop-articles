<p>
In this issue, we're going to take a slightly different tack. Instead of dealing with one<br>
printing hint, we're going to give you ten. We'll take a look at the "Top 10 Printing<br>
Crimes" that I've seen during my three and a half year adventure in Apple's Developer<br>
Technical Support Group. I'll start by listing these crimes, and then I'll discuss the<br>
solution to each one.

<p>
Here's the list:

</ol>
<p>
All of these crimes are very easy to avoid. Let's take a look at the solution to each one. 
</p>
<p>
<b>SOLUTIONS TO THE PRINTING CRIMES</b>
</p>
<p>
<b><i>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Loading PDEFs directly from within your application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b><b> </b>A PDEF is a<br>
printer&nbsp;&nbsp;driver's CODE resource definition. Each printer driver contains multiple<br>
PDEFs, which implement the various functions of the driver (such as displaying the<br>
Print dialogs, opening the connection with the printer, and supporting PrGeneral). A<br>
few applications load and call these PDEFs directly, probably because they feel this<br>
will improve printing performance. Instead, this approach will usually cause serious<br>
compatibility problems and headaches for printer driver developers. Also, it's very<br>
difficult for printing utilities (for example, utilities that count the number of pages<br>
printed) to patch into printing if an application isn't using the printing trap<br>
(PrGlue).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this approach could cause some serious compatibility problems<br>
for users when a new printer and its associated driver software are released. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Solution: </i> The main function of the Printing Manager is to load the printer driver<br>
PDEFs in a device- and driver-independent manner. Using the Printing Manager to<br>
load the PDEFs is the simplest and most compatible method. 
</p>
<p><b><i>9. Poor memory management at print time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b><b> </b>Poor memory management at<br>
print time will cause some interesting problems with various printer drivers.<br>
Usually, some object in your document won't print or you'll receive a blank page. The<br>
problem is that each printer driver available on the Macintosh requires a<br>
different amount of memory; some require very little memory, while others require a<br>
lot. For example, the LaserWriter SC is one of the piggier drivers. What's an<br>
application to do? </p>
<p>
<i>Solution: </i> Since each printer driver uses a different amount of memory, there's not a<br>
magic amount of memory that will always ensure the success of a print job. The best<br>
solution to this problem is to unload<i> all</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;unnecessary code and data segments at print<br>
time. The more memory available, the better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to ensuring that printing<br>
will work OK, more memory can improve printing performance significantly, which<br>
your users will thank you for. 
</p>
<p><b><i>8. Assuming the grafPort returned by PrOpenDoc is black and white.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b><br>
Yes, PrOpenDoc can return a color grafPort, if the printer driver you're using<br>
supports color.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, not all printer drivers are capable of returning a<br>
color grafPort. This feature caused compatibility headaches for us when we<br>
released LaserWriter driver version 6.0, which was the first printer driver from<br>
Apple that could return a color grafPort. Many applications assumed that the<br>
grafPort it returned was black and white, and this assumption caused quite a few<br>
applications to die when printing to LaserWriter driver 6.0. This assumption can<br>
also have some very ugly results if your user is printing to a color printer and<br>
you're only sending black-and-white data. </p>
<p>
<i>Solution: </i> A good rule of thumb when printing: never assume anything. Usually there<br>
are methods available to enable your application to determine the environment it's in.<br>
Printing isn't any different; in fact, this is probably even more important for<br>
printing. You should check the grafPort returned by PrOpenDoc to see whether it's<br>
color or black and white: if the high bit in the rowBytes of the grafPort is set, you<br>
have a color grafPort. 
</p>
<p><b><i>7. Not saving and restoring the grafPort or resource file in your</i></b><br>
<b><i>application's pIdle procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b><b> </b>Many applications install a pIdle procedure at<br>
print time. This procedure allows the application to present the print job status<br>
to the user. This is a very good idea--but you must be a little defensive to keep a<br>
printer driver happy.</p>
<p>
<i>Solution: </i> When your application enters its pIdle procedure, you should save the<br>
current grafPort and resource file (that is, the printer driver's). When you exit your<br>
pIdle procedure, you should restore the grafPort and resource file back to the original.<br>
This is extremely important, because the printer driver assumes that the current<br>
grafPort and resource file are always its own. If they're not, when you exit your pIdle<br>
procedure you won't be drawing into the correct grafPort, and when the printer driver<br>
makes the next Resource Manager call, it will have the wrong resource file. Technical<br>
Note #294, "Me And My pIdle Proc (or how to let users know what's going on during<br>
print time . . . )," describes the details of creating and using a pIdle procedure within<br>
your application. 
</p>
<p><b><i>6. Not using PrGeneral when you should to determine and set the</i></b><br>
<b><i>resolution of the current device.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b><b> </b>The PrGeneral trap allows a developer to<br>
determine the supported resolutions of the current printer, and also to set the<br>
resolution, determine the page orientation selected by the user, and force draft<br>
printing. Many developers who want resolution information don't use the power<br>
of this trap, but instead use a device-dependent method, which is<i>bad</i> . PrGeneral<br>
allows you to determine the resolution in a device-independent manner, so that<br>
you'll be able to print to<i>all</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;printers connected to the Macintosh without<br>
knowing about the printer you're talking to. There are now over 130 printer<br>
drivers available on the Macintosh. It would be a real shame if your application<br>
couldn't maximize its output to a device just because you made a bad assumption. </p>
<p><i>Solution: </i> This is a case where you can be<i>completely</i> device independent in your print<br>
code without sacrificing anything. You can obtain outstanding results if you use<br>
the PrGeneral trap correctly. Any time you're interested in the available resolutions<br>
for the current printer, you should use the GetRsl opcode supplied by<br>
PrGeneral. For details about getting and setting the resolution, see the "Meet<br>
PrGeneral" article in Issue 3 of<i>develop. </i> If you don't have the article handy, it's<br>
available on the<i>Developer CD Series</i> disc. Accompanying the article on the CD is an<br>
application named PrGeneralPlay that contains complete sample code for PrGeneral.<br>
You should probably also take a look at<i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume V, pages<br>
410-416. </p>
<b><i>5. Not reading Macintosh Technical Note #91, "PicComments--The Real</i></b><br>
<b><i>Deal," before you start </b><b>using PicComments in your application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b><br>
Many developers have tried to use PicComments in their applications before<br>
understanding their function, with very mixed results. If you don't follow the<br>
recommendations in Technical Note #91, you'll definitely receive some undesirable<br>
results--especially if you don't match all "open" calls with a "close" call. 
<p>
<i>Solution: </i> Read Technical Note #91<i>before</i> you start using any PicComments in your<br>
application. This Note has been rewritten with new pictures, sample code, and<br>
descriptions to help developers properly use PicComments in their printing code. It<br>
will help you avoid many of the pitfalls and misuses of PicComments. It's also helpful<br>
to look at pictures generated by other applications, to see what they're doing. 
</p>
<b><i>4. Opening the Printing Manager when your application starts up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b><b> </b>In<br>
the early Macintosh days, it was recommended that you always call PrOpen at<br>
application startup.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hasn't been the recommendation for a long time. Why?<br>
When you open the Printing Manager, it loads some of the printer driver's<br>
resources into memory. This means that less memory is available for your<br>
application. However, the real problem is that other applications or DAs cannot print<br>
until you close the Printing Manager, since the Printing Manager is<i>not</i> <br>
reentrant. Unfortunately, there isn't a reliable method for determining whether the<br>
Printing Manager is open, nor is there a method for closing it if it's already open.<br>
This isn't much of a problem any more because the majority of applications today no<br>
longer call PrOpen at startup.
<p>
<i>Solution: </i> Do<i> not</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;open the Printing Manager until you're ready to print or perform<br>
some other printing-related task (for example, initializing a print record when your<br>
application starts up). You should close the Printing Manager when the print job is<br>
complete or when you've accomplished the task at hand. You should never allow a user<br>
to switch your application out with the Printing Manager open (that is, never call<br>
WaitNextEvent between PrOpen and PrClose).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<b><i>3. Mixing high-level and low-level printing calls. </i></b><b> </b>This is one of the classic<br>
printing problems. You should<i>never</i> mix the high-level and low-level printing calls.<br>
This approach will usually cause instant death at print time, because the high-level<br>
and low-level calls do very similar things. One of the common mistakes is calling<br>
PrDrvrClose after calling PrClose. Printer drivers are not designed to use both<br>
interfaces simultaneously. 
<p>
<i>Solution: </i> In general, all applications should be using the high-level printing calls.<br>
Please follow the advice in Technical Note #161, "A Printing Loop That Cares .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;, "<br>
which describes the use of the high-level calls. Always match each "open" printing call<br>
with its corresponding "close" call. Also, check the PrError function for a printing<br>
error before making the next printing call. 
</p>
<p>
The only advantage gained by using the low-level calls would be when you're text<br>
streaming, which is easier with those calls. Technical Note #192, "Surprises in<br>
LaserWriter 5.0 and Newer," describes the use of the low-level interface.
</p>
<p>
As you might expect, there's a minor exception to this rule. If you've read the Printing<br>
Manager chapter of<i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume II, you may have noticed that the<br>
PrDrvrVers function is defined in the "Low-Level Driver Access Routines" section<br>
(page 162). This function can also be used with the high-level interface (it's the<i>only</i><br>
low-level call that can be called in the high-level interface).&nbsp;&nbsp;PrDrvrVers is very<br>
useful for determining the version of a printer driver, which will enable you to work<br>
around bugs that may exist in a specific version of a printer driver. 
</p>
<b><i>2. Accessing private and unused fields in the print record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b><b> </b>Many of the<br>
print record fields should not be accessed by an application because they're used by the<br>
printer driver as storage locations, which means the information in them<i>will</i><br>
change during a print job. 
<p>
<i>Solution: </i> You should<i> never</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;use any information from fields in the print record that<br>
have "PT" at the end of the field name. All of them have corresponding "public" fields<br>
in the print record for application use. For example, you should use the information<br>
stored in rPage, and not rPagePT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printer drivers store some of their private<br>
information in the fields with "PT" at the end of the field name. During printing, the<br>
values in these fields will change. Furthermore, different printer drivers use these<br>
fields differently, so accessing one of them might work on one driver but not another.<br>
Use the public fields! 
</p>
<b><i>1. Adding printing to your application two weeks before going final.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b><br>
This one might be a slight exaggeration, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Believe it<br>
or not, I've talked to quite a few developers who have left printing as the last feature<br>
they add to their application (or maybe next to last, just before Undo). This can<br>
cause some serious problems in your development schedule.
<p>
<i>Solution: </i> There<i> are</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;a few pitfalls in printing, but they can be avoided if you start<br>
early in the design phase of your application. My advice to avoid this problem is to<br>
start printing from your application as soon as possible. When you have an early<br>
prototype running, send some output to the printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually you can tell very early if<br>
you'll have any problems. 
</p>
<p>
One more thing: I created this list in order from the least printing crime to the worst.<br>
Actually, if you commit any of the printing crimes mentioned, you'll probably receive<br>
some undesirable results with various printers. I would suggest testing your<br>
application on at least one PostScript&#174; printer and a QuickDraw printer. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, if we take a look out onto the documentation horizon, we can see something new<br>
peeking through. What is it, you ask? It's the new and improved<i>Inside Macintosh</i><br>
chapter on printing. Yes, after years of waiting, it's finally coming. I believe you'll<br>
find the new printing chapter useful and informative. It will unlock additional<br>
information about printing on the Macintosh.
