&nbsp;Digital image processing has come a very long way. Remember when MacPaint&#174; was a<br>
revolutionary concept? Now we've got a plethora of sophisticated graphics programs<br>
available on the Macintosh for regular folks: 32-bit painting programs,<br>
image-processing programs, CAD programs, photo-realistic rendering programs,<br>
solid modeling programs, animation programs--you name it. The power to be your<br>
best, or the power to run off into the weeds? I guess it depends on who's at the<br>
keyboard. One thing is sure: art will never be the same. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I've been messing around lately with digital filtering of scanned images: taking an<br>
existing image and applying some sort of mathematical transformation to it. The<br>
results are sometimes funny, sometimes beautiful, often ugly, but always fun. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;One of the programs I've been spending time with lets you interactively type in<br>
mathematical expressions and apply them to an image. This application, called Pico, is<br>
a Macintosh implementation of an image-processing language developed by Gerard J.<br>
Holzmann at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, and described in his book<i>Beyond Photography:</i><br>
<i>The Digital Darkroom. </i> (The Macintosh version I've been using was written by John W.<br>
Peterson here at Apple, and I've included it on the<i>Developer CD Series</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;disc so that you<br>
can play with it, too.) If you're the least bit interested in image processing, you should<br>
read Holzmann's slim, friendly book. It describes the language in detail and gives lots<br>
of examples of its use. The book is full of fascinating photographs that have been<br>
tweaked and transformed using the language, ranging from the hilarious (in<br>
particular, see the Einstein caricature on page 35), to the sublimely beautiful (make<br>
up your own mind). The overall feel is one of whimsy and fun, with a strong dose of the<br>
joy of discovery. The book also includes a very instructive and in- depth discussion of<br>
the software that implements the language (a lexical analyzer, a recursive-descent<br>
parser, and an interpreter) and source code in C. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Holzmann's language allows you to invent, implement, and try out digital filters on the<br>
fly. It uses a C-like syntax and is decidedly mathematical, but that's where a lot of the<br>
fun comes in: seeing a photographic image quickly transformed by a simple<br>
mathematical formula is really fascinating. The language makes it easy to mess around<br>
and discover unusual things about math and filters: you can just type in an expression,<br>
hit the Enter key, and see the results immediately. The program operates only on<br>
8-bit gray-scale images that are 256 by 256 pixels, but the power of the language<br>
far outshines this limitation. Try it, you'll like it. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;There's another kind of digital filtering that I first learned about a little over a year<br>
ago in an article by Paul Haeberli at Silicon Graphics:<i>Paint By Numbers: Abstract</i><br>
<i>Image Representations</i> , in the SIGGRAPH '90 Conference Proceedings. This is an<br>
interactive kind of filtering, which makes it a lot of fun. The concept is simple: Start<br>
with a given image, any image (call it the source). Create a new, blank one (the<br>
destination) that's the same size. Then you "paint" on the destination with the mouse,<br>
and at each point you touch, the color of the source image is determined at that same<br>
location. A"brush stroke" is then drawn in the destination at that position, with the<br>
source's color. If the brush just drew single pixels, you would be copying the source<br>
image exactly, which would be a pretty tedious way to copy it. Ah, but the brush can do<br>
anything it wants to, and that's where the fun begins. If the brush draws, say, a circle<br>
a few pixels in diameter, you get a sort of "blot" effect, with the blots overlapping each<br>
other haphazardly. Or you could draw a line in some random direction from the source<br>
pixel's location, or add some noise to the color so that it varies a little from the source<br>
color, or draw a clump of dots centered at the source pixel, or draw a silhouette of a<br>
wiener dog in the appropriate color, or . . . the possibilities are endless. In a way<br>
you're tracing the source, but the brush you use to trace with isn't exact, and the<br>
results can be striking.
</p>
<p>
The finished images tend to look very "painterly" and are often evocative of<br>
impressionist paintings like those of Monet or Renoir, or of the pointillist<br>
"divisionist" technique of Seurat. (Can you tell I've been spending some time with my<br>
handy-dandy<i>Random House Encyclopedia</i> ? Thanks, Mom.) This is a refreshing move<br>
away from the trend toward photo-realistic rendering that you see so much of in<br>
computer graphics. 
</p>
<p>
I wrote a Macintosh application that implements a simplified version of what Haeberli<br>
did, so I could play around with it. (The application and all the source code are on this<br>
month's CD, for you to mess around with. If you find any problems, please let me<br>
know.) The most fun part turned out to be writing the brush routines, and I was<br>
curious to see just how hard it is to incorporate plug-ins into an application, so I made<br>
up a simple plug-in interface for the brushes (plug-ins are code resources separate<br>
from the application that are loaded and run as needed). Surprisingly, it turned out to<br>
be pretty trivial to implement plug-ins. I figured I was going to be forced to descend to<br>
the level of A5 worlds and code resource headers, but with the exception of one subtle<br>
gotcha it was easy. Basically you just get a handle to the code resource with<br>
GetResource, lock it, dereference it, and call it. I had to do some ugly casting to<br>
convince the C compiler to let me make the call, but other than that there were almost<br>
no problems. 
</p>
<p>
One thing turned up that I couldn't figure out, and I was forced to seek help. I was<br>
writing a filter routine (the application supports both brushes and filters as<br>
plug-ins) that was a modified version of the RedGreenInvert routine from the article<br>
"Drawing in GWorlds for Speed and Versatility" in this issue. I first tried it linked<br>
into my application, so I could use the source debugger on it. Once it was working, I<br>
converted it to a plug-in and BOOM, it crashed with a bus error. Some investigative<br>
work pointed to SwapMMUMode as the culprit, but I couldn't figure out why. (Trumpet<br>
fanfare) Bo3b Johnson to the rescue once again! It turns out that since I was calling<br>
the plug-in in 24-bit mode, when it came time to call SwapMMUMode the PC contained<br>
an address that had some of its high bits set (in this case the "locked" bit since I had<br>
locked the handle and the "resource" bit since it was a handle to a code resource). This<br>
is a bad thing. The solution, of course, is to call StripAddress on the pointer to the<br>
plug-in before calling it. That way the address in the PC is clean and SwapMMUMode is<br>
happy. 
</p>
<p>
There are several commercially available applications that do Haeberli-like image<br>
manipulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monet, by Delta Tao Software, is a much more complete and<br>
sophisticated implementation of Haeberli's concepts, incorporating some of the cooler<br>
features like opacity control, getting the direction of the brush strokes from the<br>
movement of the mouse, and so on. (You gotta love Delta Tao Software: when a customer<br>
asks for an IBM version of one of their products, they gleefully answer "Buy a<br>
Macintosh.") There's also Painter, a truly unique and remarkable paint program from<br>
Fractal Design that simulates very naturally the media artists use--chalk, pencil,<br>
charcoal, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a "cloning" function that's similar to Haeberli's in concept:<br>
you can manually or automatically draw over the "source" image with any of the<br>
brushes. Aldus Gallery Effects by Silicon Beach Software is a product that basically<br>
consists of canned filters that can be applied to images to transform them in<br>
interesting ways, many of which are similar to the effects you get with Haeberli's<br>
technique. And then of course there's Adobe Photoshop, the brilliant, precocious<br>
teenager of image- processing programs.
</p>
<p>
Photoshop seems to have become the de facto industry standard image-processing<br>
program. Its versatility is, so far, unmatched by any other program I've seen. And its<br>
plug-in interface has also become something of a standard: many Macintosh graphics<br>
programs (Painter, for one) now support Photoshop plug-ins, and I know of at least<br>
one software company that does nothing<i>but</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;writePhotoshop plug-ins. I think plug-ins<br>
are a very cool thing: they allow extension and customization of an application on the<br>
fly, bringing us a tiny step closer to the dream of "erector set" applications that can be<br>
taken apart, rearranged, and rebuilt by users to suit their needs. If you want to write<br>
some Photoshop plug-ins, you can find the documentation for the plug-in interface<br>
(along with examples in MPW C, MPW Pascal, and THINK C) on the CD. 
</p>
<p>
Here's the big, deep question about these digitally transformed images: Are They Art?<br>
An image produced by any of these applications can indeed be "arty"; of that there is no<br>
doubt. But is it really art? Many graphic artists would immediately answer with a<br>
resounding "NO!" They'd say that it just looks like art, that it imitates art (kinda like<br>
life), but isn't really art because it's<i>automatic</i> . But many painters in the surrealist<br>
and abstract impressionist movements took great interest in what they termed<br>
"automatic" painting, painting without the intervention of conscious control. Jackson<br>
Pollock was a notable practitioner of this technique. Is the creation of a painting by<br>
automatic means any different, in principle, from what these computer-based tools<br>
do? 
</p>
<p>
"Wait a minute!" these artists might cry, "Pollock began with a blank canvas! What he<br>
did was truly original! You (smug smirk) are just taking an existing image and<br>
transforming it with a computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's not art, that's just (expression of extreme<br>
distaste)<i>filtering</i> ."
</p>
<p>
"Wipe that smug smirk off your face," I might smirk smugly, "what about the<br>
dadaists? They claimed that art was anything that anyone decided to<i>call</i> art, and I'm<br>
calling these images art." (Fun dadaist tales: Marcel Duchamp, a dadaist in New York,<br>
bought a urinal, signed it "R. Mutt," and called it art.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He claimed that the signature<br>
alone made any manufactured item into a work of art. These "readymades," as he called<br>
them, sold quite well. And then there's Kurt Schwitters, a Hanover dadaist, who made<br>
collages from rubbish. Now the dadaist movement, admittedly, was intended to upset<br>
the status quo, rip apart the definition of art, and shock people out of their bourgeois<br>
sensibilities, but their influence is still strongly felt in modern art, and has forever<br>
muddied the definition of what art is. For that I heartily thank them.)
</p>
<p>
There's another eminently pragmatic definition of art: it's art if someone is willing to<br>
buy it. This one is distasteful in its materialistic slant, but I must admit that it's a<br>
useful one, at least to people who make a living making art. Then there's the Marshall<br>
McLuhan stance that "art is anything you can get away with." I personally love this one<br>
for its nebulousness, and I'm willing to leave it at that. 
</p>
<p>
Whatever definition we pick, we still can't conclusively say whether these<br>
computer-transformed images are art. Art is just too slippery a thing to pin down,<br>
like trying to put a cloud in a chair. I think art is primarily a dialog between the<br>
creator and the experiencer: if something is communicated, I'll call it art. But in the<br>
final analysis, does it really matter? These tools are just another kind of computer<br>
fun, and<i>everyone</i> , artist or not, can play.

<b>DAVE JOHNSON</b> would like to share with you a quote from <i>The Three-Pound Universe</i><br>
by Judith Hooper and Dick Teresi, a wonderful book about the human brain: "Research<br>
at Yale University's Center for Behavioral Medicine turned up the surprising fact that<br>
regular 'reading therapy'--that is, reading a book for half an hour a day--is<br>
neurophysiologically equivalent to the practice of TM. (Whether this means the<br>
Maharishi's mantras are comparable to <i> Heidi </i> or merely reflects the crudeness of our<br>
measuring devices, we'll let you decide.)" This finding vindicates Dave's habits in a<br>
way no heartfelt argument ever could. *
