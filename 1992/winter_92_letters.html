<b>CURLING UP WITH DEVELOP</b><br>
Regarding your editorial in Issue 8: I agree with you on liking to have a "hard copy" to<br>
be able to curl up with when trying to understand something for the first time. I can<br>
always go to the computer and try examples or ideas. But to lay back and put up my feet<br>
or nestle under a quilt in bed is more relaxing to let concepts sink in and develop on<br>
their own, to spring forth with clarity later.<br>
<p>
I like the idea of sending the disc separately in its own case--though I never had a<br>
mangled disc problem. It is the magazine itself that has a rougher trip. I received Issue<br>
8 without the disc and hope that the disc is not far behind. The mailing label on the<br>
back cover was half off, not torn, but detached. Flapping in the breeze, so to speak.
</p>
<p>
Keep up the good work on the magazine. I look forward to it each time.<br>
--Robert Redmond
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for your letter. It's not only heartening to hear from developers who agree</i><br>
<i>with me on this, but it makes a difference. Your opinions do count.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The disc is now in a separate case, but it's not mailed under a separate label. They</i><br>
<i>should have arrived wrapped cozily together. We'll send you the disc right away. Sorry</i><br>
<i>about that.</i>
</p>

<b>TEXT FORMATS GALORE</b><br>
There's a problem with the Macintosh Technical Notes which I'm finding with<br>
increasing frequency in Apple's electronic publications. The only word processor I use<br>
is Nisus, with which I can read MS Word 3.0 and 4.0 files without buying a Microsoft<br>
product. This may be an unreasonable prejudice, but I bet it isn't uncommon.
</p>
<p>
<i>But</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nisus can't decipher fast-saved Word files. This means, I suspect, that the entire<br>
set of new Macintosh technical publications is unavailable to me. Worse, I fear that the<br>
next Developer CD is going to have lots of files with new, valuable, and (for me)<br>
hidden information.
</p>
<p>
I know Apple is serious about electronic distribution of technical documents. I'm sure<br>
fast-saving in Word is a great convenience to the authors, but surely using a format<br>
not widely readable defeats the purpose of the exercise. I don't object to standardizing<br>
on Word 3.0 or 4.0, so long as that format-- and not Microsoft's convenience<br>
variant--is actually used.
</p>
<p>
Could you <i>please </i> ask your authors, when providing documents for publication, to use<br>
an accessible format?<br>
--Fritz Anderson
</p>
<p>
<i>Thank you for alerting us to this problem. It was a snafu on our part. None of the files</i><br>
<i>should have been fast- saved in Word.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>We know that having text documents in Word and MacWrit e &#174; represents a bias</i><br>
<i>toward these products. Unfortunately our alternatives are limited and we'll probably</i><br>
<i>have to continue using these products until the spring.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The good news is that we're working on a new text formatting tool. This tool will be</i><br>
<i>available on the CD and will be able to open, search, and print text documents available</i><br>
<i>on the CD. The dilemma of how to make every document available to every developer</i><br>
<i>has been a topic of discussion for some time. We're hoping this will solve the problem.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Again, thank you for your input. Developer feedback is the fuel of change around here.</i><br>
<i>Keep it coming.</i><br>

<b>NEW AND IMPROVED CD</b><br>
I just received Issue 8 of <i> develop</i> , and was pleased to find that the developer's CD has<br>
improved. Is this new?--Mike Caputo
</p>
<p>
<i>Yes, starting with Issue 8 the CD is not just Developer Essentials, but the entire</i><br>
<i>Developer CD Series disc (of which Developer Essentials is just a subset).</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>SUBMITTING TO DEVELOP</b><br>
First of all, I'd like to say that I'm a big fan of <i> develop</i> . The combination of excellent<br>
technical articles (with required humor) and a CD-ROM of other developer materials<br>
is unmatched.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least the flak surrounding the CD-ROM has finally calmed down in<br>
the Letters section. I've always liked the idea from the start even though I purchased a<br>
CD-ROM drive only last week.
</p>
<p>
I'm writing to find out if <i> develop </i> accepts articles from non-Apple employees. I<br>
haven't looked through the back issues to see if there were any, but none come to mind.<br>
If so, do you have a style guide for writing articles?
</p>
<p>
Keep up the great work!<br>
--Paul-Marcel St-Onge
</p>
<p>
<i>Thank you for your kind words about </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;develop<i>; it's always a pleasure to receive mail</i><br>
<i>from a big fan. Yours is the type of letter that editors in chief dream of.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>We do indeed accept articles from non-Apple employees (see this issue's Editorial).</i><br>
<i>We have a vast array of materials ready for prospective authors, including an</i><br>
<i>introductory document, a short submission form, a set of detailed author's guidelines,</i><br>
<i>and even a Microsoft Word template for entering your article in a </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;develop<i>-like</i><br>
<i>format. We'll start with the intro and then send the rest as you need it.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>On the subject of the CD-ROM controversy, it may experience a revival as a result of</i><br>
<i>Apple's dropping printed </i> develop<i> and Tech Notes from the monthly mailing to</i><br>
<i>Associates and Partners. We'd like to hear what developers think about that.</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>
</p>

<b>ART ILLEGIBLE ON-LINE</b>
</p>
<p>
Figure 1 from Michael Gough's article on Futures (Issue 7) was illegible when printed<br>
under System 7 from a Macintosh II on a LaserWriter II NTX. It's just as illegible on<br>
the screen. Any ideas?
</p>
<p>
The HyperCard&#174; format on the CD is convenient for flipping to pages and articles but<br>
is terrible for seeing all of a page at one time, since HyperCard's windows are not<br>
resizable. Further-more, HyperCard is slow--especially from a CD. And searching is<br>
neither fast nor intuitive.<br>
--Steve Tyler
</p>
<p>
<i>I looked into the problem and found out that a mistake was made when the electronic</i><br>
<i>version of Issue 7 was created: Art that's in EPS format is normally opened in an</i><br>
<i>application that interprets PostScrip t&#174; and then saved as a PICT. This process wasn't</i><br>
<i>followed, with the result that the conversion to PICT was only an approximation, and</i><br>
<i>so not very legible. This will be fixed in Issue 7 on the CD.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Regarding the HyperCard format, a lot of people agree with you. We're working on an</i><br>
<i>alternate viewing mechanism--but this mechanism may not apply to </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;develop <i>for a</i><br>
<i>while yet. Meanwhile, HyperCard's windows are in fact resizable. If you're not able to</i><br>
<i>resize them, your memory partition for HyperCard is probably not large enough; try</i><br>
<i>increasing it.</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>

<p>
