<p>
&nbsp;One very neat feature of the Macintosh is that you can connect more than one screen to<br>
the computer and use them as if they were one big screen. Better still, applications<br>
take advantage of multiple screens automatically. But the screens that are attached to<br>
your system can have different sizes, depths, and color tables, and you might want to<br>
optimize your application for each screen, or you might want to find the best screen to<br>
display something on. Both these things are easy to do, but not necessarily in the ways<br>
that you might think at first. In this column, we'll uncover a few important truths<br>
about QuickDraw's handling of multiple screens, and we'll talk about a few ways to deal<br>
with multiple screens if you want to go beyond what QuickDraw gives you for free. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;It's important to understand that if you're just drawing items to a window and want to<br>
stay completely above the specifics of different screens, don't do anything<br>
special--just draw to your window as if there were one screen. QuickDraw was<br>
designed to make multiple screens look like one, so you should take advantage of this<br>
valuable abstraction if you can. Note too that machines with original QuickDraw can<br>
also have multiple screens, but we don't describe that here. 
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;Truth #1: Windows don't change their depth or color table when they're moved to</i><br>
<i>different screens. </i>
</p>
<p>
One of the most common misconceptions about multiple screens is that a window's<br>
pixMap holds the size, depth, and color table of the screen that the window is on. That<br>
seems logical enough at first glance, especially considering that each screen has its<br>
own pixMap. But it's not true, because a window can cross more than one screen.<br>
Instead, the pixMap of a window always holds the depth, color table, and bounds<br>
rectangle of the main screen (the one with the menu bar) even if the window is<br>
nowhere near the main screen. The pixMap of a window is, in essence, a copy of the<br>
main screen's pixMap, except for one detail: the bounds rectangle of a window's pixMap<br>
is in the local coordinates of the window while the bounds rectangle of the main<br>
screen's pixMap is in global coordinates. In fact, any screen's pixMap has a bounds<br>
rectangle that's in global coordinates, indicating that screen's position relative to the<br>
main screen. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;To find the sizes, depths, or color tables of the screens your window is on, you should<br>
use the list of GDevices that the system maintains (usually called the<i>device list</i> ),<br>
which gives you the pixMap of each screen. We'll describe a method of using the device<br>
list later. 
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;Truth #2: There are exactly two coordinate systems. </i>
</p>
<p>
With multiple screens,&nbsp;&nbsp;it's easy to get confused by what looks like many coordinate<br>
systems, but there are only two: the local coordinate system of the current port and<br>
the global coordinate system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QuickDraw has no concept of a coordinate system for<br>
each screen. Global screen coordinates are always relative to the main screen--the<br>
global coordinate (0,0) is always at the extreme upper left corner of the menu bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
All coordinates in a graphics port are local coordinates, including the bounds rectangle<br>
of the port's pixMap. This bounds rectangle has two purposes. First, it defines the area<br>
of a pixel image that QuickDraw can draw into. Second, the top left point of the bounds<br>
rectangle is the horizontal and vertical distance from the origin of the local coordinate<br>
system to the origin of the global coordinate system. Specifically, if you subtract the<br>
coordinate of the top left corner of the bounds rectangle from all the other coordinates<br>
in a port, you convert those coordinates into the equivalent global coordinates. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;An example of the relationship between the portRect of a window and the bounds<br>
rectangle of its pixMap is shown in the following figure. The two screens in the<br>
example are next to each other and are both 640 pixels across and 480 pixels down,<br>
with the main screen on the left, and the window is contained entirely on the second<br>
screen. Global coordinates are marked around the corners of the screens and the<br>
portRect and bounds rectangle are marked with a dashed outline. Notice that the bounds<br>
rectangle circumscribes the main screen, and it's in the local coordinates of the<br>
window. If you subtract the components of the bounds rectangle's top left corner from<br>
the coordinates of the portRect, you get the rectangle [T:25 L:660 B:325 R:1160],<br>
which is the portRect in global coordinates.

</p>
<p>
<i>Truth #3: QuickDraw switches to the GDevice of each screen your drawing crosses as</i><br>
<i>it's drawn. </i>
</p>
<p>
When you draw something to a window, QuickDraw searches the device list for every<br>
GDevice whose gdRect intersects your drawing. For each intersecting GDevice,<br>
QuickDraw makes it the current GDevice and then draws the intersecting part of your<br>
drawing. Switching GDevices is important because the current GDevice provides the<br>
current color environment, which tells the system what color corresponds to each<br>
pixel value and vice versa. As QuickDraw draws across your screens, it keeps<br>
switching the current GDevice to the one for the screen it's actively drawing to. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Color environments are specific to each screen. Compare this with grafPorts and<br>
cGrafPorts, which provide the screen-independent drawing environment that tells the<br>
system things like the pattern, pen size, and color to use when drawing something.<br>
Each window gets its own drawing environment, but has to share the color<br>
environments with other windows. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Therefore, you should never switch GDevices to have QuickDraw draw to a specific<br>
screen-- QuickDraw switches GDevices as appropriate. Whenever you have<br>
QuickDraw draw to any screen, the current GDevice should be the main screen's<br>
GDevice, which it is by default. The only time that you should switch GDevices<br>
explicitly is to switch between on-screen and off-screen drawing. 
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;Truth #4: On- and off-screen drawing are different. </i>
</p>
<p>
QuickDraw distinguishes between on-screen and off-screen drawing for a couple of<br>
reasons. Starting with 32-Bit QuickDraw 1.0, video memory can only be reached in<br>
32-bit addressing mode. If QuickDraw detects that it's drawing to a screen, it switches<br>
to 32-bit addressing mode, writes to video memory, and then switches back to the<br>
native addressing mode. QuickDraw stays in the native addressing mode for the entire<br>
operation when it draws off-screen unless bit 2 of the pmVersion field of the<br>
destination pixMap is set or unless it draws into a GWorld that's cached on a<br>
QuickDraw accelerator board. In those two cases, QuickDraw switches to 32-bit<br>
addressing mode even though it's drawing off-screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important difference<br>
between on-screen and off-screen drawing is that on-screen drawing makes<br>
QuickDraw go through the additional work of using the gdRects of the screens to<br>
determine which GDevices you're drawing to. We described this in Truth #3. When<br>
QuickDraw draws off- screen, it just uses the current GDevice. 
</p>
<p>
QuickDraw senses whether it's drawing on-screen or off-screen by comparing the<br>
baseAddr field of the current graphics port's pixMap against the baseAddr of the main<br>
screen's pixMap. If they're equal, QuickDraw assumes that it's drawing on-screen (not<br>
necessarily the main screen!). Otherwise, QuickDraw assumes that it's drawing<br>
off-screen. 
</p>
<p>
To avoid confusing QuickDraw regarding whether it's drawing on-screen or<br>
off-screen, make sure that you always draw to a window for any on-screen drawing.<br>
The pixMap of any window is a lot like the main screen's pixMap, as we described in<br>
Truth #1, so the baseAddr of a window's pixMap is always the same as the baseAddr of<br>
the main screen's pixMap. 
</p>
<p>
<b>TRUTH IN ACTION</b><br>
There are several ways to use these truths so that your applications optimize their<br>
displays for the sizes, depths, and color tables of each of the screens that are attached<br>
to the systems your application runs on. What follows are a few ways to do this. 
</p>
<p>
If your window is completely contained on one screen, you might want to optimize your<br>
window's image for the screen it appears on. Usually, this means finding out the depth<br>
and color table of the screen your window is on. The device list, introduced in Truth<br>
#1, is invaluable for getting this information. For each GDevice in the list<br>
(remember, each GDevice represents a screen), compare the rectangle of its gdRect<br>
field against the rectangle of your window. The gdRect is in global coordinates while<br>
your window's portRect is in local coordinates, so you'll have to convert one or the<br>
other before doing the comparison. Once you've found the GDevice whose gdRect<br>
encompasses your window, get the GDevice's pixMap from the gdPMap field. Within<br>
this pixMap, the pixelSize field tells you the depth of the screen, and the pmTable field<br>
gives you a handle to the screen's color table. The device list is a linked list; you can<br>
get the first GDevice in the list with GetDeviceList, and you can go to the next GDevice<br>
with GetNextDevice. 
</p>
<p>
What if your window intersects more than one screen? A common way to deal with this<br>
is to compromise by choosing a screen based on some criterion. You might want to<br>
choose the deepest screen that your window crosses, or the screen that intersects most<br>
of your window. The program listing at the end of this column shows a routine called<br>
FindScreenGDevice that takes a rectangle in global coordinates and a criterion, and<br>
returns the GDevice of the screen that satisfies the criterion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this GDevice, you<br>
can get the information you need from the pixMap in the gdPMap field. If you pass<br>
kDeepestScreen for the criterion, FindScreenGDevice returns the GDevice of the<br>
deepest screen that intersects the rectangle. If you instead pass kLargestAreaScreen,<br>
the GDevice of the screen that has the largest intersection area is returned. Normally,<br>
you'd convert your window's portRect to global coordinates with the LocalToGlobal<br>
QuickDraw routine, and pass the resulting rectangle to FindScreenGDevice. 
</p>
<p>
If your window displays an off-screen image and GWorlds are available, you can use<br>
GWorlds to make an off-screen image with the best depth and color table for the<br>
screens your window is on. If you pass 0 as the pixel depth to NewGWorld or<br>
UpdateGWorld and pass a rectangle defining the part of your window that displays the<br>
off-screen image in global coordinates, NewGWorld and UpdateGWorld set up an<br>
off-screen graphics environment that has the same depth and color table as the deepest<br>
screen your rectangle intersects, even if the area of intersection is as small as one<br>
pixel. 
</p>
<p>
In some cases, you might want to display an image specifically to one screen, maybe<br>
for a presentations application or a game. To choose a screen, use a routine like<br>
FindScreenGDevice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you've chosen a screen, set up a window that fills that entire<br>
screen. Then draw to the window normally. In other words, you should again pretend<br>
that there's only one screen available, except that you have a little bit of insider<br>
information about where to put a window on that screen to make your images look or<br>
act best.&nbsp;&nbsp;System 7 introduced the DeviceLoop routine, which is the recommended<br>
method for drawing images that are optimized for every screen they cross. For<br>
example, the highlight color can be drawn in black on a 1-bit screen, but in magenta<br>
on a deeper screen. If your application is running on a pre-7.0 system, you can<br>
simulate DeviceLoop by using a routine like DeviceLoopSim, as we show below. But to<br>
maintain future compatibility, DeviceLoop should be used if it is available. 
</p>
<p>
You don't have to do anything special to let your applications work with multiple<br>
screens; QuickDraw makes multiple screens look like one screen. Use this abstraction<br>
even if you want to take advantage of specific screens. Keep using QuickDraw at a high<br>
level, and multiple-screen compatibility comes for free.
