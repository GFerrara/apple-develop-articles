If you're familiar with C++ classes but new to thinking about components, you may<br>
find it instructive to know how the two compare. Although each has its own niche in<br>
Macintosh software development, components and C++ classes have many features in<br>
common.
</p>
<p>
In general, both components and C++ classes encourage a building-block approach to<br>
solving complex problems. But whereas a component is separate from any application<br>
that uses it, a class exists only within the application that uses it. Components are<br>
intended to add systemwide functionality, while classes are intended to promote a<br>
modular approach to developing a program. 
</p>
<p>
We can also compare components and C++ classes in terms of how they're declared and<br>
called, their use of data hiding and inheritance, and their implementation. But first,<br>
let's briefly review what a class is and what a component is. 
</p>
<p>
<b>SOME BASIC DEFINITIONS</b><br>
A class, in the programming language C++, is a description of a data structure and the<br>
operations (methods) that can be performed on it. An instance of a class is known as an<br>
object. Classes are provided in C++ to promote an "object-oriented programming<br>
style." By grouping a data type and its methods together, classes enable programmers<br>
to take a modular approach to developing a program.
</p>
<p>
A component, as described in the preceding article ("Techniques for Writing and<br>
Debugging Components"), is a single routine that accepts as arguments a selector and a<br>
parameter block. The selector specifies which of several (or many) operations to<br>
perform, and the parameter block contains the arguments necessary for that<br>
operation. Components are "registered" with the Component Manager and can be made<br>
available to either the program that registered the component or to any program that's<br>
executed, making it possible to add systemwide functionality. For instance, if Joe's<br>
Graphics Corporation develops a new image compression technique, it can be sold to<br>
users as a component. Users install the component simply by dragging an icon into a<br>
folder, and that form of image compression is then automatically available to all<br>
programs that make use of graphics.
</p>
<p>
<b>DECLARING CLASSES AND COMPONENTS</b><br>
A C++ class is declared in much the same way as a struct, with the addition of routines<br>
that operate only on the structure described. Once the class is declared, instances can<br>
be declared in exactly the same way as other variables. That is, to create an instance of<br>
a class, you either declare a variable of that class or dynamically allocate (and later<br>
deallocate) a variable of that class.
</p>
<p>
A component must be registered with the Component Manager. At that time, its type,<br>
subtype, manufacturer, and name are specified. The type, subtype, and manufacturer<br>
are long integers; the name is a string.&nbsp;&nbsp;Component instances can only be created<br>
dynamically, using specific Component Manager routines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create an instance of a<br>
component that has been registered, a program must first find the component. If the<br>
seeking program is the same one that registered the component, it already has the<br>
component. If not, it can make Component Manager calls to search for all available<br>
components with a given type, subtype, and manufacturer; any part of the description<br>
can be a wild card.
</p>
<p>
Once a component has been found, it must be opened, and this operation produces a<br>
reference to the component instance. Operations can be performed on the component<br>
instance using this reference.
</p>
<p>
Table 1 compares how classes and components are declared and how instances of each<br>
are created.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note that for components, the code is idealized.)
</p>
<p>
<b>CALLING ALL ROUTINES</b><br>
Calling a routine that operates on a C++ object is slightly different from making a<br>
standard routine call: the call more closely resembles a reference to an internal field<br>
of a struct. The routine that gets called is identical to any other routine, except that<br>
it's declared within the class definition rather than at the same brace level as the main<br>
routine. 
</p>
<p>
Calling a component routine is identical to calling any other routine. The first<br>
argument is always the component instance, and other arguments may optionally<br>
follow. The return type of every component routine is a long integer, and part of the<br>
numerical range is reserved for error messages from either the component or the<br>
component dispatch mechanism.
</p>
<p>
The Component Manager lets a program issue calls to a component that it has never<br>
"met" before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This form of dynamic linking is crude, because no type checking is<br>
performed. 
</p>
<p>
Table 1 compares how classes and components are called. 
</p>
<p>
<b>DATA HIDING</b><br>
A C++ class can have "private" fields and methods, which are accessible by class<br>
methods but not by the caller. The programmer can see these private parts simply by<br>
perusing the class declaration. If a change to the implementation of a class requires<br>
that the private parts be changed, relinking with the implementation of the class won't<br>
be sufficient: all clients must be recompiled, since the positions of public fields might<br>
have changed. (One tricky way around this is to include a private field of type char *<br>
that's really a pointer to the class's internal state data. The class constructor allocates<br>
memory for whatever internal state it likes and coerces a pointer to it to live in that<br>
char * field. This technique is useful for object-only software library distribution<br>
and also protects proprietary algorithms from curious programmers.)
</p>
<p>
A component is responsible for allocating memory for its internal state (the<br>
component's "globals") when it's opened and releasing that memory when it's closed.<br>
There are both component globals and component instance globals. These correspond to<br>
static and automatic variables in a C++ class and have similar utility. A component<br>
might keep track of how many instances of itself have been opened and restrict that<br>
number by failing on the open call.
</p>
<p>
<b>INHERITANCE</b><br>
It's often useful to build software on top of existing functionality or, alternatively, to<br>
take existing functionality and alter it to perform a more specialized function. Both of<br>
these things can be accomplished for C++ classes with inheritance. In the former case,<br>
the new class will have methods that don't exist in the base class; in the latter, the new<br>
class will have methods with the same name as methods in the base class but that take<br>
precedence over the base methods. 
</p>
<p>
Components and the Component Manager support both kinds of inheritance as well, as<br>
discussed in the preceding article. All components of a given type must support the<br>
same set of calls, although this is enforced only by convention. Components of a<br>
particular type and subtype may optionally support other calls as well, and<br>
components of a particular type, subtype, and manufacturer may support still more<br>
calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case where a component wants to use the services of another component<br>
and perhaps override some of its functions with modifications, Component Manager<br>
utilities let a component designate another component as its "parent." A simple<br>
protocol ensures that the correct variant of a routine gets called. When a component<br>
must call itself, it must issue the call to its child component, if any.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a<br>
component wants to rely on the existing implementation of the parent component, it<br>
must pass the call to its parent. 
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPLEMENTING CLASSES AND COMPONENTS</b><br>
My discussion of implementation is based on the 68000 platform, since that's the only<br>
one I've scrutinized with regard to compiled C++ and Component Manager calls.
</p>
<p>
The routines that can be used with a C++ class are declared, and optionally<br>
implemented, within the class declaration. They behave like normal C routines, as<br>
described earlier. 
</p>
<p>
A call to a C++ class that has no parents or descendants is compiled as a direct<br>
subroutine call, exactly as is a standard routine call. A call to a C++ class that has<br>
parents or descendants is slightly more complicated. A table lookup is used at run time<br>
to determine exactly which implementation of a routine gets called for the particular<br>
object being operated on. Such a call takes perhaps a dozen assembly instructions. 
</p>
<p>
A component consists of only a single routine. It's passed a selector and a parameter<br>
block. The selector is used to decide which operation to actually perform, and the<br>
parameter block contains all the arguments passed by the caller.
</p>
<p>
The component's parameter block is untyped -- the component routine has no way to<br>
determine what kinds of arguments were originally passed, and herein lies the danger.<br>
Some languages, such as LISP, have untyped arguments; in LISP, however, a routine<br>
can determine how many arguments have been passed and what the argument types are.<br>
A component interface is more like assembly language -- or C without prototypes! --<br>
in that it can determine nothing about what has been passed to it. 
</p>
<p>
You can't compile a C++ program containing a call to a nonexistent routine; the<br>
compiler will balk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Well, OK, this isn't strictly true: there are dynamically linking<br>
systems for C++, and other languages, that let you call a C++ routine that hasn't been<br>
linked with the rest of the compiled source code; the routine can be linked to later, at<br>
run time. But no facility of this type is currently standard in the Macintosh Operating<br>
System or supported under the standard Macintosh development tools.) In the case of<br>
components, the compiler can't check for such illegal calls, since the particular<br>
components that may be opened are decided at run time. Therefore, the caller must be<br>
prepared to handle a "Routine Not Implemented" error if a call is made with an<br>
unknown selector. 
</p>
<p>
All calls to components pass through the Component Manager's dispatch mechanism.<br>
The dispatcher must locate the component's entry point and globals from the component<br>
reference, which is not simply a pointer but a packed record containing an index into a<br>
table and some bits used to determine whether the component reference is still valid. If<br>
a client makes a call to a component it no longer has open, the Component Manager has<br>
a statistical likelihood of catching this call and returning an appropriate error.
</p>
<p>
The Component Manager has facilities to redispatch the parameter block to one of many<br>
routines, and those routines are written to take the arguments as originally passed.<br>
The Component Manager was originally written for use on the 68000 series of<br>
processor; on computers with that processor, the parameter block doesn't have to be<br>
recopied onto the stack for further dispatching. On other processors the parameters<br>
might have to be recopied, however. 
</p>
<p>
The Component Manager has been highly optimized and fast dispatching can reduce its<br>
overhead still more, but in general its lookup-and-dispatch process still takes several<br>
dozen instructions. If the component being called is using the Component Manager's<br>
inheritance mechanism, further overhead is incurred by passing control to the parent<br>
or child component. Overall, the Component Manager is quite efficient, but still not as<br>
efficient as direct routine calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 1 compares how classes and components are<br>
implemented. 
</p>
<p>
<b>IN SUM</b><br>
Components, as supported by the Component Manager, exhibit many of the features of<br>
C++ classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both encourage a modular approach to solving problems. Both feature<br>
inheritance and data hiding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they differ is in how they're declared and<br>
implemented, how they do (or fail to do) type checking, and how expensive they are to<br>
call. Each occupies its own distinct niche in Macintosh programming: classes as a way<br>
to ease development of a single program, components as a way to add systemwide<br>
functionality and give control and choice to the user.
