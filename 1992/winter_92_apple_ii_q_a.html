<h2>APPLE II Q &amp; A</h2>
<h1>APPLE II Developer Technical Support</h1>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> What's the best way to do text-only printing to a character device through GS/OS?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b> If you want to print text to a GS/OS character device, here's how you do it:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at all the on-line devices to find which are character devices. You<br>
can tell when a device is a character device by examining bit 7 of the<br>
"characteristics" word returned by DInfo--the bit is set for block devices and<br>
clear for character devices. You don't have to hard-code a list of character<br>
device IDs.</li>
<li>Present the user with a list of device names followed by their location and<br>
generic type in parentheses. You can adjust the names of device types to reflect<br>
your use. For example, ".RPM (AppleTalk printer, port 1)," ".DEV2 (serial<br>
modem, port 2)," or ".DEV3 (generic character device, slot 5)." You can use<br>
bit 3 of the slot returned by DInfo to know whether to return "slot" or "port,"<br>
too.</li>
<li>When the user selects a printing device, call Open on the device name<br>
(such as .RPM for an AppleTalk printer). Use Write to write the information,<br>
just as you would to a file; then call Close (you can call Flush if you like, but<br>
it shouldn't be necessary). That's all you need to do.</li>
</ol>
<p>
&nbsp;Remember not to embed ImageWriter or any other printer-specific codes in the<br>
output stream. With the exception of choosing a device and creating a file, this same<br>
code could be used to print to <i>any</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;text printer or to another device such as a disk or<br>
modem. You might give users a "text printing preferences" dialog where they can enter<br>
some codes if they like, and you might have built-in sets for ImageWriters and other<br>
common printers, but don't make it too complicated. These instructions are very<br>
generic and will work well on any setup, not just an ImageWriter II connected through<br>
the serial port.

<b>Q</b><i> On a ROM 03 Apple II GS, I save and restore the mouse mode by getting it from</i><br>
<i>ReadMouse, setting the mode to what I need, and restoring the value (with SetMouse)</i><br>
<i>when done. This sometimes kills the mouse--I don't get any mouse movement until my</i><br>
<i>program quits. Help! By the way, this isn't a problem on ROM 01 machines. </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b> The ROM 03 mouse firmware doesn't behave as documented in two respects. First, it<br>
sometimes returns an illegal mouse mode value from ReadMouse. Specifically, there's<br>
garbage in the high nibble of the mouse mode byte. Second, SetMouse returns an error<br>
and takes no action when passed an invalid mode, even though the <i> Apple IIGS Toolbox</i><br>
<i>Reference</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;says it returns no errors. When you try to restore the invalid mode,<br>
nothing happens and the mouse stays in whatever mode you had it in--if it's not what<br>
the system needs, the mouse will appear "hung" until someone sets the mode to what<br>
the system does need.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;You can work around this problem by masking off the high nibble of the mode result<br>
from ReadMouse (AND #$000F in 65816 assembly) before passing it to SetMouse.<br>
This problem is fixed in Apple IIGS system software version 6.0-- ReadMouse always<br>
returns a valid mode under 6.0.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> When I call SFMultiGet2, I randomly get error $1705 (bad pathname descriptor in</i><br>
<i>the reply record) even though that error doesn't mean anything for that call. Any</i><br>
<i>ideas?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b> All versions of SFMultiGet2 before Apple II GS System 6.0 incorrectly look at two<br>
of the words in the reply record (offsets $0008 and $000E) to make sure they don't<br>
contain the value $0002. That value would be illegal in those positions--in any of the<br>
<i>other</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;new Standard File calls. SFMultiGet2 doesn't use the same reply record, but<br>
pre-6.0 versions of Standard File accidentally check those fields anyway. Make sure<br>
the values in bytes that are past the beginning of the 6-byte reply record are not<br>
$0002. This is fixed in System 6.0.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Although my application fully supports GS/OS, the Finder uses slashes instead of</i><br>
<i>colons in the pathnames in message #1. This means my application can't open any files</i><br>
<i>that have slashes in the filename.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b> The Finder and its message-passing conventions were originally released before<br>
GS/OS was written. Applications depend on the slash (/) as the separator character to<br>
be able to parse these pathnames (for example, to find the filename to use in a<br>
document window title). If the separator character were to change, many older<br>
applications would break.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Finder version 6.0 may support an additional message containing a list of fully<br>
expanded GS/OS pathnames. These pathnames use colons as separators and aren't<br>
limited to 255 characters. See the Finder 6.0 documentation for details on using this<br>
message.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I've written a program that hangs inside Standard File under Apple II GS System</i><br>
<i>5.0.4, but works fine under development versions of 6.0. I'm not using any</i><br>
<i>6.0-specific features. What could be the problem?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b> Standard File before System 6.0 does not behave gracefully if called with both<br>
prefix 0 and prefix 8 empty. Try setting one of these prefixes to an existing directory<br>
and see if your problem vanishes.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I can't find the ProDOS partition on Volume IX or later of the Developer CD Series</i><br>
<i>discs. What's happened?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b> Apple II information was duplicated on all Developer CDs from Volume III through<br>
Volume VIII because without the ProDOS partition, Apple II users couldn't see the<br>
information, and without the Apple II folder on the HFS partition, the information<br>
couldn't be shared on an AppleShare file server (or Macintosh System 7 File Sharing).<br>
Apple II GS System 6.0 includes an HFS (Macintosh) file system translator, which<br>
means that Apple II GS developers can access the information on the HFS partition,<br>
making the ProDOS partition unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The Apple II information can be found on the HFS partition with the pathname Dev.CD<br>
Vol. IX:Development Platforms (Moof!):Apple II. Note that this means the Apple II<br>
folder can only be accessed from ProDOS 8 using AppleShare with long naming on--the<br>
path to the Apple II folder is not a legal ProDOS 8 pathname.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Apple II Applesoft's floating-point routine results are sometimes accurate to only</i><br>
<i>two places. For example, the answer returned for PRINT 55555.099-55555.09 is</i><br>
<i>9.01031494 E-03. How can we get more accurate results?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b> The accuracy loss you're experiencing with the Applesoft floating-point routines is<br>
normal. If you convert a number such as 55555.099 to a base 2 floating-point<br>
number, you won't get an exact representation using Applesoft's floating-point<br>
routines or even 96-bit precision IEEE numerics. Because 9.01031494 E-03 is<br>
0.0090103, you can see that you have accuracy out to three and a half decimal places.<br>
The solution is to determine the accuracy that you want and massage the result to give<br>
you that accuracy. Here's a sample program that shows common Applesoft rounding<br>
techniques:
</p>
<pre>1 REM Round to 3 decimal places of accuracy example
10 Input a
20 Input b
30 If a-b&gt;1000 then 100: REM no 3-digit rounding of numbers &gt;1000
40 Print "Standard Applesoft Non-accurate result:";a-b
50 Print "Truncated result:";
   INT((a-b)*1000)/1000 60 Print "Rounded result:";
   INT(((a-b)+.0001)*1000)/1000
70 Goto 10
100 Print "Result has 3 decimal accuracy already:";a-b
110 Goto 10</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;This is the only way that you can get Applesoft to clip the numbers, apart from using a<br>
separate floating-point engine. Alternatively, you can do your own conversion from<br>
Applesoft internal numeric format to a string in assembly language and have it<br>
simulate the above operation when converting the number.
