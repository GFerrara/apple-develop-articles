<h2>GRAPHICS HINTS FROM FORREST</h2>
<h2>USING THE PALETTE MANAGER OFF-SCREEN</h2>

</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Most people who've done any graphics programming on the Macintosh are aware of the<br>
Palette Manager, because it's the documented way to control the on-screen color<br>
environment, and perhaps because my cohorts and I in Developer Technical Support<br>
keep going on about how right the world would be if everyone used it. In an effort to<br>
follow the rules as best they can, some people have taken the Palette Manager so much<br>
to heart that they use it not only with windows, but with off-screen cGrafPorts as<br>
well--something that isn't heard about very much. Some of these people have<br>
concluded that all the features of the Palette Manager apply just as well to off-screen<br>
cGrafPorts as they do to windows. Logical enough, right? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Well, that's the kick; whether this is logical or not, the truth is that only a small part<br>
of the Palette Manager works with off-screen cGrafPorts. Specifically, the<br>
pmCourteous usage mode and the pmWhite and pmBlack usage-mode modifiers work<br>
fine when they're used in a palette that's attached to an off-screen cGrafPort, but the<br>
pmTolerant, pmAnimated, and pmExplicit usage modes do not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this column, I'll<br>
describe how you can take advantage of the Palette Manager features that work<br>
off-screen and how you can simulate the features that don't work. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The pmCourteous usage mode seems pretty useless to a lot of people because it has no<br>
effect on the current color environment. But in general, making a palette full of<br>
pmCourteous colors is a lot better than hard-coding RGBColors into your code. Instead<br>
of hard-coding colors, make a palette of courteous colors--as many entries as you<br>
need colors--and save it as a 'pltt' resource. When your application runs, call<br>
SetPalette to attach this palette to your off-screen cGrafPort. When you need to use a<br>
color while drawing into this cGrafPort, pass the desired color's palette index to<br>
PmForeColor or PmBackColor, and then draw. This is better than hard-coding colors<br>
because you or a software localizer can easily change the colors by changing the 'pltt'<br>
resource--no code changes are necessary. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The pmWhite and pmBlack usage-mode modifiers are new with System 7; they let you<br>
specify whether you want a particular palette entry to map to white or black in a<br>
black-and-white graphics environment. By default, colors whose average<br>
color-component value is larger than 32767 are mapped to white and other colors are<br>
mapped to black. (If you use RGBForeColor, Color QuickDraw also checks to see<br>
whether your specified color is different from your background color but maps to your<br>
background color; if so, Color QuickDraw uses the complement of the color you<br>
specified so that your drawing is visible over the background.) By specifying that a<br>
palette entry is pmCourteous + pmBlack or pmCourteous + pmWhite, you can control<br>
which colors map to black and to white when there aren't enough colors available. This<br>
applies to palettes attached to off-screen cGrafPorts as well as to palettes attached to<br>
windows. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Those are the Palette Manager features that do work off-screen. Now I'll talk about the<br>
features that don't and what you can do to get the same effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pmExplicit usage<br>
mode is handy when you want to draw using a pixel value without knowing or caring<br>
what color that pixel value represents. With this mode you can easily show the colors<br>
in a screen's color table, and you can also draw into a pixel image with a specific value<br>
even though you specify the color for that value elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>
When you have a palette that's attached to an off-screen cGrafPort, pmExplicit colors<br>
are interpreted as pmCourteous colors. Instead of using a palette, you should convert<br>
your pixel value to an RGBColor and use this as the foreground or background color.<br>
Set the current GDevice to your off- screen GDevice so that the color environment is<br>
set; then pass your pixel value to Index2Color, which is documented on page 141<br>
of<i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume V. Index2Color converts your pixel value to the<br>
corresponding RGBColor, which you can pass to RGBForeColor or RGBBackColor, and<br>
then you can draw. The result is that your pixel value is drawn into the destination<br>
pixel image. 
</p>
<p>
Both the pmAnimated and pmTolerant usage modes are used to modify the color<br>
environment, and both are interpreted as pmCourteous when they're in a palette that's<br>
attached to an off-screen cGrafPort. The most important difference between the two<br>
usage modes is in the style of color-table arbitration that they do-- pmTolerant gives<br>
the front window the colors it needs, while pmAnimated additionally makes sure that<br>
nothing outside the front window is drawn in its colors. Color-table arbitration doesn't<br>
apply off screen, so the pmAnimated and pmTolerant usage modes can be unified into "I<br>
want to change my off-screen colors."
</p>
<p>
Changing the colors in an off-screen color environment means changing its color table;<br>
the most straightforward way to do this is to modify the contents of the color table<br>
directly. That is, get your off-screen color table's handle and then directly assign new<br>
values to the rgb fields in its CSpecArray.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could also assign a whole new color<br>
table to the off-screen environment by assigning the new one to the pmTable field of<br>
the off-screen pixMap. Either way, you have to tell Color QuickDraw what you've done<br>
by updating the changed color table's ctSeed field. The next time you draw into your<br>
off-screen graphics environment, Color QuickDraw detects your change by comparing<br>
the ctSeed of your changed color table against the iTabSeed of the current GDevice's<br>
inverse table, and it rebuilds the inverse table according to the changed color table.<br>
You can update the ctSeed field by assigning to it the return value of GetCTSeed, which<br>
is documented on page 143 of<i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume V.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the 32-Bit QuickDraw<br>
extensions are available, you can update a color table's ctSeed simply by passing the<br>
color table to CTabChanged, documented on page 17-26 of<i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume VI. 
</p>
<p>
If you have a GWorld and you want to replace its color table, you should call<br>
UpdateGWorld, passing it a new color table. UpdateGWorld makes sure that all the<br>
cached parts of a GWorld are properly updated, which is tough to do any other way. If<br>
you don't pass any flags to UpdateGWorld, it's within its rights to destroy your existing<br>
GWorld's image. But if you pass the clipPix or stretchPix flag, UpdateGWorld is<br>
obligated to keep your existing image, and it tries to reproduce the existing image in<br>
the new colors as best it can. 
</p>
<p>
To wrap up, you can use the Palette Manager with off-screen graphics environments,<br>
but you'll only be able to use the pmCourteous usage mode and the pmWhite and<br>
pmBlack usage-mode modifiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that's not to cast aspersions on these features,<br>
because they can be very handy for both on-screen and off-screen drawing. The<br>
pmExplicit, pmTolerant, and pmAnimated usage modes don't work for off-screen<br>
drawing, but there are easy ways to simulate those features without the Palette<br>
Manager and without risking future compatibility.
