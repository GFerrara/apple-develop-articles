<b>DEVELOP ON FTP.APPLE.COM</b><br>
I think <i>develop </i>is the greatest Macintosh journal around. I've gotten lots of help from<br>
the articles and the code on the CD. One thing about the CD: It would be nice if I could<br>
ftp the files from apple.com, since I don't have a CD-ROM player.<br>
--Jim Wintermyre<br>
<p>
<i>Thanks for the kind words about </i> develop, a<i>nd for the idea of putting the files on</i><br>
<i>apple.com (actually, it's now ftp.apple.com). Like Technical Notes, DTS Sample Code,</i><br>
<i>and Snippets, </i> develop <i>articles and code are now available via anonymous ftp on</i><br>
<i>ftp.apple.com, thanks to Mark Johnson, manager of Apple's Core Technical Support</i><br>
<i>group, who does this on his own time.</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>

<b>OUR AUTHORS ARE REAL</b><br>
I would like to suggest that you publish your authors' e-mail addresses. I wanted to<br>
send a note of praise, thanks, and encouragement to Bryan K. ("Beaker") Ressler,<br>
author of the excellent article "The TextBox You've Always Wanted" in Issue 9-- but I<br>
didn't know how to reach him. Even a "Find Address" search on AppleLink turned up<br>
nothing. Are you sure this guy's for real?<br>
--James Plamondon
</p>
<p>
<i>Yes, we're sure. Since receiving your suggestion, we're asking all authors if they'd</i><br>
<i>like to put their e-mail addresses in their bios. Many would prefer not to be contacted</i><br>
<i>directly. And sometimes the authors are in flux and don't have a stable or convenient</i><br>
<i>address for a while. Where no address is provided, letters should be sent to the</i><br>
<i>AppleLink address DEVELOP, and they'll be forwarded.</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>ASSOCIATES MISS DEVELOP</b><br>
In Issues 8 and 9 of <i> develop</i>, you mentioned that Apple Partners and Associates no<br>
longer receive a printed copy of the publication. If I were an Associate, and I plan to<br>
become one soon, I would continue to subscribe to the printed version.
</p>
<p>
First, there's the "curling up in front of a fire" factor you mentioned. There are many<br>
places I take<i>develop </i>that I couldn't take a Macintosh and CD-ROM drive. It slips easily<br>
into a briefcase and can be read on a bus or while waiting in line. While I'm reading <br>
<i>develop</i>, somebody else can use the Macintosh. Some of&nbsp;&nbsp;the articles require some effort<br>
to understand, which is easier while sitting in an overstuffed chair with the article in<br>
my hands than while looking at a computer screen. Oh, yeah, put a cat in my lap for<br>
good measure.
</p>
<p>
Second, the aesthetic experience of the printed version would be hard to give up. The<br>
beautiful covers are the most obvious part of this, but the care you put into laying out<br>
the pages, providing just the right amount of white space, selecting the typefaces to<br>
complement each other and make the content easy to read makes reading <i> develop </i>a very<br>
pleasant experience. Then there's the smell of a newly printed <i>develop </i>and the faint<br>
"crick" sound of it being opened for the first time.
</p>
<p>
Third, the printed version has material that would be impossible to view on the 1-bit<br>
screen I'm using. How would I know what "Konenna" looks like without a printed copy?<br>
How would I know what <i>you </i>look like? Even if I could display some of the artwork and<br>
photographs, it would take some effort and time, and I might not bother. Turning a page<br>
is a very simple thing to do. And the access time is much faster than a CD-ROM could<br>
ever be.
</p>
<p>
Fourth, the "green" factor. A Macintosh uses electricity even when you're just sitting<br>
there staring at the screen. I haven't noticed <i> develop </i>using any, no matter how long I<br>
spend reading it. I believe you use partially recycled paper, and you don't have to<br>
worry about my copies being recycled because they'll sit on the bookshelf until I die or<br>
get a room in the loony bin. Sort of like <i> National Geographic</i>.<i>develop</i>, in its physical<br>
form, is beautiful, informative, sometimes funny, interesting, and occasionally<br>
inspiring. I won't give it up when I become an Associate, though for what that costs I<br>
darn well shouldn't be asked to. Keep up the good work. I appreciate it!<br>
--Lyle Gunderson
</p>
<p>
I've been a fan of <i> develop </i>since its first issue, and still look forward to each one. I take<br>
mouse in hand to share my angst about hardcover versions of <i> develop</i>.
</p>
<p>
I love them.
</p>
<p>
Hey, we recycle at home. We have a compost heap. We're down to one car. But, for a<br>
mag like<i>develop</i>, I like the feel of hefting it, scanning through to see what's up, and<br>
snooping through the bios looking for the ever present chuckles. It's a magazine I sit on<br>
the couch with and, what else, browse. This is not the Technical Notes stack, nor is it <br>
<i>Inside Macintosh</i>. I'm prepared to look at them through the glass keyhole of my Apple<br>
monitor, since they're only mildly amusing, very functional, and I usually need them<br>
when I'm in front of it anyway. That's what references are for.
</p>
<p>
But <i>develop</i> is a different beast. <i> develop</i> is <i>Life</i> magazine for Mac-crazed software<br>
craftspeople. It needs to be perused, thoughtfully, where it can be set down and have<br>
some latte dripped on it.
</p>
<p>
I hope the developer mailing resumes the practice of sending <i> develop </i>in paper form.<br>
--David Kauffman
</p>
<p>
<i>I love these letters--and the similar comments that we got at this year's Worldwide</i><br>
<i>Developers Conference. As a result of all this feedback, which has been pouring in</i><br>
<i>since </i> develop <i>was taken out of the developer mailing, people in high places at Apple no</i><br>
<i>longer believe that this is what most Associates and Partners want. No changes are</i><br>
<i>imminent, but the subject is not dead. For now I can only urge you to pay the $30 to</i><br>
<i>subscribe to</i>develop <i>in its printed form.</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>NEW SINCE LAST DEVELOP?</b><br>
Could you prevail on the Developer CD folks to include a "What's new since last<br>
develop" folder on CDs that come with <i>develop</i>? It would be done like the very nice<br>
"What's new on this CD?" folder, but cover three months rather than one.<br>
--John Baxter
</p>
<p>
<i>The "What's new on this CD?" folder now indicates (separately) what's new for each of</i><br>
<i>the last three months--in this case, June, July, and August. Thanks for the idea!</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>FAKIN' IT</b><br>
<i>develop </i>is a great publication, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;Q &amp; A section is especially useful. In Issue 10<br>
you define the term "fakey" as "riding your snowboard backwards." There are two<br>
problems with this. First, the correct spelling is "fakie." The greatest mistake,<br>
however, was not attributing the word to its original source: skateboarding.<br>
Snowboarding has taken almost all of its trick names from skateboarding, "fakie"<br>
included. Keep up the good work, but get the facts straight! ;-)<br>
--Frank Giraffe
</p>
<p>
<i>We here at </i>develop <i>are embarrassed and chagrined that such an obvious and important</i><br>
<i>error could have slipped past us, and we apologize profusely for any inconvenience</i><br>
<i>this misrepresentation of fact has caused you, either real or imagined. Thank you for</i><br>
<i>your comments.</i><br>
<i>--Dave Johnson</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>IT MAKES OUR DAY WHEN YOU WRITE </b>We welcome timely letters to the editors,<br>
especially from readers reacting to articles that we publish in <i> develop</i>. Letters should<br>
be addressed to Caroline Rose (or, if technical <i> develop</i>-related questions, to Dave<br>
Johnson) at Apple Computer, Inc., 20525 Mariani Avenue, M/S 75-2B, Cupertino,<br>
CA 95014 (AppleLink: CROSE or JOHNSON.DK). All letters should include your name<br>
and company name as well as your address and phone number. Letters may be<br>
excerpted or edited for clarity (or to make them say what we wish they did). *
</p>
<p>
A note for international folks: Tech Notes now print on A4 paper as well as US Letter,<br>
so you don't need to spend hours reformatting them by hand! *
</p>
<p>
<b>Send your feedback on Tech Notes</b> or Sample Code to Neil at AppleLink NMDAY or<br>
on the Internet at nmday@apple.com. *
