<h2>SYSTEM 7.0 SNEAKS</h2>
For those who missed the Q &amp; A session on System 7.0 at the May 1990 Apple<br>
Worldwide Developers' Conference, here's a sampling of what went on.<br>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>It would be nice to have Apple Events that could get a list of valid Apple Events from</i><br>
<i>an application. Is that going to be available?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>There are Apple Events to do that&nbsp;&nbsp;kind of thing already, and if you discussed the<br>
issue on AppleLink &#174; you'd find that out right away.<i>That's a hint. Get it?--ED.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Can I drop Control Panel device files into the Apple menu folder and launch them</i><br>
<i>directly from the Apple menu?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The short answer is yes. The more complete answer is this: Anything you could<br>
double-click from the FinderTM can be dropped into the Apple menu folder and<br>
launched from the Apple menu.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>My corporation has billions and billions of zones. We need a larger zone-name</i><br>
<i>selection area in the Chooser. A list with the first few characters isn't good enough. Can</i><br>
<i>this be fixed?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>This is one of those things that used to be "an important future direction," so we did<br>
something about it. And now it's fixed in System 7.0.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>In many cases, you have the same application in different versions with the same</i><br>
<i>creator. It would be nice if you could double-click a document and consistently turn on</i><br>
<i>the oldest version, or the latest version, instead of just the one you last copied. Is this</i><br>
<i>possible?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Not only is that possible, but--except for what looks like a small bug--it's already<br>
implemented and in the version of System 7.0 you have.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>You said earlier that a driver would lock down a completion routine. I just wondered</i><br>
<i>how a piece of software could lock down code that's of unknown extent and possibly</i><br>
<i>discontiguous.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>You must have misunderstood. The Device Manager takes care of holding down the<br>
parameter block and also takes care of not calling the completion routine until paging<br>
is safe, so the completion routine itself doesn't have to be held down. Neither does any<br>
of the data it touches. The driver doesn't have to do anything. It's all handled by the<br>
Device Manager.<b>Q</b><i>But how does the Device Manager know that the completion routine is</i><br>
<i>going to be around? </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>It doesn't. The Device Manager defers calling the completion routine until paging is<br>
safe.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>What limit is there, if any, on the number of published and subscribed items allowed</i><br>
<i>for an application?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>For a particular document, the maximum number is the maximum number of open<br>
files available, and, for an application, the maximum is limited by disk space.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Are there changes or do you have plans for changes to the way applications are</i><br>
<i>allocated memory under the omnipresent MultiFinder &#174;? For instance, is there a way</i><br>
<i>to dynamically grow their memory? I find that I have sort of a "normal" size for an</i><br>
<i>application. And then, once in a while, I switch to Finder to give the application the</i><br>
<i>entire memory.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>If you're developing an application, you can use temporary memory and eliminate<br>
most of the need to do this. We're certainly investigating models that won't require the<br>
somewhat stilted setting of partition size that we have today. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Dear Miss Manners: Will the operating system have the capability of launching a</i><br>
<i>hidden application? An example is when you want to have one application launch</i><br>
<i>another, send it some high-level events to potentially select some text, copy to the</i><br>
<i>Clipboard, and then quit the application, without having the application show up and do</i><br>
<i>all that in front of the user.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>At first glance, this looks like an application-level thing, and a product could be<br>
designed this way. We're not planning to support this type of thing directly in the OS.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Would it be feasible to keep Help resources in a separate file? If opened from within</i><br>
<i>the application, these resources should appear in the regular Resource Search Path. </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>That's absolutely right. If you keep the file open and in the path when you call the<br>
Help Manager, you can keep the Help in a separate file. <b>Q</b><i>Is there a lot of authentication</i><br>
<i>for high-level events, or should applications that need password protection implement</i><br>
<i>the events themselves through the PPC toolbox in high-level events?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>We have authentication built into all the interapplication communication stuff,<br>
through the Users and Groups portion of the Control Panel.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>This one's addressed to the Macintosh gods and goddesses. Using high-level events, is</i><br>
<i>there a mechanism for bringing a background application to the front? If not, is there</i><br>
<i>any way for the application to bring itself to the front?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The simple answer is, the Process Manager now has calls for doing this. In terms of<br>
user interface, though, it's probably a very bad idea to spring an application on the<br>
user from the background. He or she could be initializing a disk, or something!
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>What is the Apple definition of </i> 32-bit clean?
</p>
<p>
<b>A&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>This is one of our favorite questions. What <i> 32-bit clean</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;refers to is an application<br>
that doesn't contain anything to prevent it from running on a system with a 32-bit<br>
memory manager. The application can't contain any code that relies specifically on<br>
24-bit stuff. Examples are masking the high bit, treating addresses as signed<br>
addresses, or using some specific old calls in low-memory globals whose accessibility<br>
is intrinsically limited to 24-bit addressing. The idea is explained in a lot of detail in<br>
Technical Note #212, so that's the Apple definition of<i>32-bit clean:</i> Tech Note #212. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Will System 7.0 run on a Macintosh 512K enhanced ("512Ke") with third-party</i><br>
<i>memory, a SCSI upgrade, and&nbsp;&nbsp;2 MB of memory?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>We hope so! There are thousands of us who have those! And our plan is that it'll work<br>
on those configurations. There's nothing we're doing to prevent that.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Can a Macintosh boot off the network?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Current Macintosh computers don't support network booting (that is, booting off a<br>
file server), mostly because the ROM code doesn't know to look out on the network for<br>
boot devices. In the future, you'll see network-bootable Macintoshes, though. It's going<br>
to take a little bit of time, but you'll see those.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Can a user lock out his or her disk from network access, high-level events, and so</i><br>
<i>on, for a set time (during data acquisition, for example)?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>There is a user interface to turn off all Apple Events, but not for a set time. You turn<br>
it on and off in the network setup Control Panel. And there's a programmatic interface<br>
to shut down file sharing if it's currently running.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Is FileShare simply a personal AppleShare &#174; server? Could you please compare and</i><br>
<i>contrast the capabilities of AppleShare and FileShare?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The guts of FileShare is really a personal server. FileShare provides all the same<br>
call support as any AppleShare server, so the inner workings are the same. However,<br>
a lot of the tuning, a lot of the performance, and a lot of the upper limits have been<br>
lowered. FileShare is intended only for two or three people. It's much simpler, and<br>
provides more personal services, than the big, full-blown dedicated server.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>If System 7.0 has a real font size and width--for example, if the width of the letter</i><br>
<i>is 8.5 pixels--is the width rounded to 8? </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Font sizing is the same as before System 7.0. It's affected by the Set Fract Enable<br>
call in the Font Manager, and there's also a fractional pen position in color QuickDraw,<br>
so that the rounding works properly over multiple characters, rather than over a<br>
single character. This hasn't changed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Is the Database Access Manager intended to provide a vendor-independent interface</i><br>
<i>for database packages?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The Database Access Manager is really intended to provide a vendor-independent<br>
interface to data. You could use it to talk to Macintosh databases, or whatever.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Whatever happened to the Foreign File System Manager? Last year, we talked about</i><br>
<i>being able to use ProDOS and&nbsp;&nbsp;MS-DOS volumes on the desktop.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The unfortunate answer is that the Foreign File System Manager didn't make our<br>
schedule for System 7.0,&nbsp;&nbsp;but we're working on it for a subsequent release.
