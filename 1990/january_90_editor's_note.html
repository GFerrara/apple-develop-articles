<h2>Editor's Note</h2>
<h1>Louella Pizzuti</h1>
<p>
Now that you're holding the first issue of develop, Apple's quarterly technical journal,<br>
you may want to know how and why it got to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a company, Apple tries to support<br>
third-party developers as much as possible: in addition to the tools and system<br>
software our engineers write to make your lives easier, we've got an entire<br>
department (the Apple Developer Group) of more than 300 people whose jobs consist<br>
of trying to help you be successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do that by lobbying for software and hardware<br>
changes that will make your development job easier and more productive, and by<br>
publishing marketing and technical information.&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter develop.
</p>
<p>
This journal is intended to lead you into other reference materials like <i> Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i>and the<i>Apple IIGS Reference Manual</i> ; it doesn't try to replace or reword<br>
these books, it complements them and helps you figure out which sections you may<br>
need to study more carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each article includes the author's photo and a biography.<br>
This should help you understand the minds behind the madness (as well as help you<br>
spot these folks at trade shows).
</p>
<p>
I like to think of develop as very heavily commented sample code.&nbsp;&nbsp;The text that<br>
surrounds the code explains and clarifies what the code does and why.&nbsp;&nbsp;We want you to<br>
understand and to use the code freely, so we've included a CD that contains the entire<br>
journal as well as applications built from the code in the articles.&nbsp;&nbsp;This should make it<br>
easier for you to find what you're looking for, and for you to copy the code you'd like to<br>
use.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each quarter we'll include the past issues and code, so if you've got one develop<br>
CD, you've got them all (as long as it's the most recent one).
</p>
<p>
Because we want the code to demonstrate what the text explains, you won't see the<br>
latest breaking news here.&nbsp;&nbsp;What you will see is code that solves real problems in ways<br>
that we'll strive to keep compatible in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the questions and answers<br>
(and many of the articles) come from the Apple Developer Technical Support group, so<br>
you know they're more than just theoretical exercises.&nbsp;&nbsp;They're questions or problems<br>
that real people have struggled with; hopefully publishing them here will help you<br>
solve your own problems before you lose too much sleep.
</p>
<p>
Just as the programming problems you face are many and varied, so too are the<br>
articles in this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our color suite includes Bruce Leak talking about the changes he<br>
made to 32-Bit QuickDraw, Dave van Brink discussing the new and improved Palette<br>
Manager, and Guillermo Ortiz saving you time (and compatibility headaches) by<br>
explaining the new offscreen calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our other articles run the gamut from Dave<br>
Radcliffe's compilation of compatibility strategies, to Eric Soldan describing his new<br>
8-bit development system, to Mark Baumwell explaining exactly how to build and<br>
debug a declaration ROM, and finally to Scott "Zz" Zimmerman giving the scoop on how<br>
to mix PostScript and QuickDraw for a happy tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
If you're a Certified developer, Partner or Associate, you'll be getting develop every<br>
quarter as a part of your developer package.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not in one of the above<br>
programs, you can subscribe to develop using the envelope and order form in the back<br>
of the journal.
</p>
<p>
If you like develop, I'd love to hear about it, and if you don't like it, I'd like to change<br>
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;So let me know what you think.&nbsp;&nbsp;What you like, what you hate, and what you'd like<br>
to see more of.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll listen and respond, and together we can make develop evolve into<br>
the journal we've all been waiting for.
