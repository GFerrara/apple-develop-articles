<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>

<h1>LOUELLA PIZZUTI</h1>
<p>
Dear Readers,
</p>
<p>
By now, I'm tiptoeing through the bulb fields of Holland and painting like a fiend (note<br>
the backpack and the tulips in the photo). But because of Carol, Dave, the review<br>
board, the technical reviewers, this issue's authors, and Lenore directing a host of<br>
others, you are holding the third issue of <i>d e v e l o p</i>.
</p>
<p>
Carol "Editor in Louella's Clothing" Westberg is the managing editor of <i>d e v e l o p</i><br>
while I'm out on my much-needed sabbatical; she's the one who's making sure that the<br>
articles say what we want to say (and hopefully what you want to hear) in a way that<br>
we'd like to say it. Dave "if you can hold it, I can juggle it" Johnson joined us in our <i>d e</i><br>
<i>v e l o p </i>adventures just two short weeks before I took off. As our staff engineer, the<br>
technical buck stops with him. He makes sure that all of the code is fully tested and<br>
that technical disagreements end in decisions, not fist fights. The review board is a<br>
group of talented, thorough, dedicated, and vocal Apple engineers who ride herd on the<br>
rest of us. Together, Andy Shebanow, Pete Alexander, Tim Enwall, and Larry<br>
Rosenstein steer<i>d e v e l o p</i> (and the articles within each issue) in the right direction.
</p>

<p>
The review board guides us on the content, but when it comes to covers, Cleo&nbsp;&nbsp;(see the<br>
pages describing the <i>Developer Essentials </i> disc for her bio) and I go wild. So, why a<br>
tortoise? Well, this issue's theme is CD-ROM and when confronted with&nbsp;&nbsp;CD-ROMs,<br>
many people first think "slow!" It's true, that compared with a hard disk, a CD-ROM<br>
disc can seem to move like molasses on a winter morning. Or like a tortoise in a race<br>
with a hare. Hmmm, how did that fable go? Seems to me that everyone expected the<br>
hare to win hands (or feet) down. But initial impressions notwithstanding, the tortoise<br>
took off and came out the clear winner. The same applies to CD-ROM; slower than a<br>
hard disk, sure, but faster by far than a human. In the end, the information and the<br>
space are well worth the wait.
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the CD-ROM articles and figure out how you, like the tortoise,&nbsp;&nbsp;can end<br>
up a technological winner.

Louella Pizzuti<b> Editor</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LOUELLA PIZZUTI</b> is a career woman in shorts who freely admits that her favorite<br>
joke isn't funny. Her favorite part of working at Apple is the texture, and her favorite<br>
place to be is outside.
</p>
<p>
Inside or outside, her favorite color's yellow (the color of madness) and her favorite<br>
painter's Vince. 
</p>
<p>
She likes to play: in the mud (usually planting flowers); on the soccer field; in the<br>
weeds&nbsp;&nbsp;(it's easier than pulling them); but never, ever with words.
</p>
<p>
She's got her lemon tree (finally) and the convertible is next. We're all wondering<br>
what will happen to the flowers in the bed of her truck. *
