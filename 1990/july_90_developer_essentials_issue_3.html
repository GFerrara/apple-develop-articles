<h2>DEVELOPER ESSENTIALS: ISSUE 3</h2>
<p>
<i>Introducing the new </i> Developer Essentials<i> disc. In addition to</i>d e v e l o p<i> and related</i><br>
<i>code, on this issue of the disc you'll find tools and information we think every</i><br>
<i>developer should have. These pages highlight what's on the disc, but once you start</i><br>
<i>browsing, you'll also find a few surprises.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>To use the disc, you need a CD-ROM drive and the appropriate cables and connectors.</i><br>
<i>Refer to your CD-ROM drive's owner's manual for detailed information about</i><br>
<i>connecting the drive to your particular machine.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>For a Macintosh, you need at least 1 MB of memory, System 4.1 or&nbsp;&nbsp;later, and Finder</i><br>
<i>5.4 or later. In addition, you need to copy the Apple CD-ROM INIT that comes with the</i><br>
<i>CD drive startup disks into your System Folder. For an Apple II, your SCSI card must</i><br>
<i>have Rev C or later ROM. With ProDOS, no special setup is required. If you use GS/OS,</i><br>
<i>you must use the Installer on System Disk 4.0 or later to install the CD-ROM driver</i><br>
<i>onto your startup volume.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>d e v e l o p </b>You've read the articles, you've bought the arguments, and now it's time<br>
to write your own code. The idea is that you don't waste your time typing the example<br>
programs--just mount this handy CD-ROM, then copy and paste. We've includedd e v e<br>
l o p as well as the code from each of the articles to help you avoid typos. So, browse<br>
around, take what you need, and save the rest for a rainy day. Each new issue of<br>
<i>Developer Essentials</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;will archive all of the back issues of the journal and the code. So<br>
look forward to one-stop searching coming soon to a CD-ROM near you.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't yet<br>
have a CD-ROM drive, you should be able to find the contents of <i> Developer Essentials</i> <br>
on AppleLink, the Apple FTP site on the Internet, and other on-line services in the<br>
near future.
</p>
<p>
<b>International System Software</b><i>Developer Essentials</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;includes all the latest<br>
international versions of Macintosh system software as well as the latest U.S. versions<br>
of GS/OS and ProDOS, all in DiskCopy image format. (You must have a Macintosh to<br>
run DiskCopy and create floppy disks from these images.)
</p>
<p>
<b>International HyperCard</b> Need the latest version of HyperCard? Look no further. <br>
<i>Developer Essentials</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;includes the latest international versions of this "software<br>
erector set" in DiskCopy image format.
</p>
<p>
<b>DTS Technical Notes and Sample Code</b> All Apple II and Macintosh Technical Notes<br>
and Sample Code programs are included for your reference. Be sure to check here for<br>
the latest and greatest development information and Developer Technical Support<br>
programming tips and techniques.
</p>
<p>
<b>Macintosh Technical Notes Stack</b> This HyperCard stack incorporates all of the<br>
latest Macintosh Technical Notes into a single on-line source, which is<br>
cross-referenced with <i>SpInside Macintosh</i> , Q &amp; A Stack, and the Human Interface<br>
Notes Stack.
</p>
<p>
<b>Macintosh Q &amp; A Stack</b> Got a tough development question? Try the Q &amp; A Stack,<br>
which is a collection&nbsp;&nbsp;of the most frequently asked questions DTS receives from<br>
developers. Organized by subject, this stack answers the questions within and includes<br>
cross-references to <i>SpInside Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Macintosh Technical Notes Stack.
</p>
<p>
<b>SpInside Macintosh</b> Of course the most essential of all&nbsp;&nbsp;documentation for Macintosh<br>
developers is <i> Inside Macintosh</i> , so <i> Developer Essentials</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;offers you <i>SpInside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i> , an on-line version of volumes I-V. <i> SpInside Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;combines all five<br>
volumes into a single, searchable electronic form that is&nbsp;&nbsp;cross-referenced with the<br>
Macintosh Technical Notes Stack, Q &amp; A Stack, and Human Interface Notes Stack.
</p>
<p>
Now you have some of the headliners in <i> Developer Essentials</i> , but you should take<br>
some time to browse the disc and see what else you might discover. We'll be adding<br>
more as <i> Developer Essentials</i>evolves, and we hope you agree that these are tools that<br>
no developer should be without.

<p>
The allegedly 27-year-old Jack Hodgson, product manager of <i> Developer Essentials</i> ,<br>
produced and directed corporate videos in Boston, ran a small, computer book<br>
publishing company, did some free-lance programming,&nbsp;&nbsp;and founded the Boston<br>
Computer Society's Mac Users Group. His next big life goals are to buy his own plane<br>
and to learn to play his piano well enough to cut loose in Dave Szetela's Excellent<br>
Annual WWDC Moofamania Jam Sessions (caution: unofficial title).
</p>
<p>
<b>SCOTT CONVERSE</b> is the group's Electronic Media Mogul and leader. A true on-line<br>
addict, he makes a living cruising the electronic highways and getting information to as<br>
many people as possible by using computers. Scott also loves sci-fi (particularly<br>
cyberpunk), reads books on design, and plays music on any of six full-blown,<br>
wall-shaking stereo systems in his house. When not cruising the electronic highways,<br>
he's racing radio-controlled cars. Would you ride the fiber optic byways with this<br>
guy? *
</p>
<p>
<b>COREY VIAN</b> takes the Zen approach to most things. He has an interdisciplinary B.A.<br>
in art and math from Maharishi International University. (Really! It's in Iowa.) An<br>
eight-month Apple veteran (two years and eight months if you count his prior<br>
consulting), he's now doing information interface design.&nbsp;&nbsp;(See his sidebar in the first<br>
article in this issue.) An avid meditation practitioner, he also flies airplanes, builds<br>
cabinetry, windsurfs, snow skis, practices aikido, and composes R&amp;R music--and he<br>
claims he isn't busy. *
</p>
<p>
<b>CLEO HUGGINS</b> studied graphic design at the Rhode Island School of Design, taught<br>
design and semiotics at the Portland School of Art in Maine, and created the music<br>
typeface "Sonata" when she worked at Adobe. She received an M.S. in digital typography<br>
from Stanford University, and plays electric violin. Cleo always knew the computer<br>
would be a good place to combine her interests; she has joined Apple to help refine the<br>
use of typography and design (and maybe even music) in our CDs. *
</p>
<p>
<b>MARY SKINNER</b> collects the input, supervises testing, processes the feedback and is<br>
the group's systems administrator (thank goodness Mary is a HyperCard fanatic). <br>
She's a native Iowan born in New York City. Her B.A. in physics and B.A. in Russian<br>
from the University of Iowa landed her as an Air Force Lieutenant at Johnson Space<br>
Center. In her spare time, she plays with the computer, reads sci-fi (she's a Poul<br>
Anderson fan), and listens to the nonsoft side of rock and roll. Mozhete skazat "Def<br>
Leppard"? *
