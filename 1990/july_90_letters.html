I just wanted to let you know that I have found both issues of <i>d e v e l o p </i>to be<br>
extremely useful. You do an excellent job in picking up where <i> Inside Macintosh </i> leaves<br>
off. I hope Apple continues to publish <i>d e v e l o p </i>for a long time.<br>
-- Paul Higinbotham<br>
<p>
Of all the technical journals I receive about the Macintosh, Digital VAX, and computing<br>
in general, all pale in comparison to your d e v e l o p . Please send me a copy.<br>
--Steve Salika
</p>
<p>
In your last issue, Curt Bianchi tells me to beware of how the Memory Manager grabs<br>
my Pascal object's handles. Then, in another article, Richard Clark tells me that the<br>
Memory Manager has a secret life and that I should be careful when I pass it pointers.<br>
My question is, should I ask the Memory Manager to take a blood test before we get<br>
serious? <br>
--Concerned in Palo Alto
</p>
<p>
<i>Although you are right to be cautious about getting serious with the Memory Manager,</i><br>
<i>there is really no need for a blood test. The very articles that you mention present</i><br>
<i>clear guidelines for having safe yet fulfilling, uh, "interactions" with the Memory</i><br>
<i>Manager. These guidelines, judiciously and conscientiously (and enthusiastically!)</i><br>
<i>followed, provide all the protection you will need.</i><br>

After using both on-line documentation and hard copy for a while, I prefer hard copy.<br>
It is easier to read, and more immediate. I like the concept of having complex and<br>
interrelated documentation on- line with cross referencing a click away. When you<br>
obtain instant response time, on-line documentation will&nbsp;&nbsp;be invaluable.<br>

<b>STEPS FORWARD</b><br>
Thanks for all the fantastic work on <i>d e v e l o p </i> --I love it, and being&nbsp;&nbsp;an American<br>
abandoned in England, it is one of the most informative journals I get over here.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do<br>
have a couple of gripes (read, "winges" in England) about the software used to display<br>
the articles.
</p>
<p>
The control panel windoid is a complete pain--it doesn't fit on a&nbsp;&nbsp;13-inch monitor<br>
without obscuring the text window unless you move it halfway off the screen, so you<br>
have to be continually moving the panel around the screen. I then decided to print out<br>
some of the articles, but that isn't much easier, because you either have to know the<br>
page where each article begins, or navigate there one page at a time.
</p>
<p>
It would be nice to see a control panel which is vertically oriented so that it can fit<br>
along with the text window on a 13-inch screen, and to also include a button which<br>
jumps to the next article--moving to the first and last pages is not really that useful.<br>
I think it would also be much more useful if the text for each page fit in a window<br>
rather than having to scroll each window as well as forward each page.<br>

<i>As you know, we're entering an era in&nbsp;&nbsp;the Macintosh world that revolves around</i><br>
<i>electronic publishing. Many of the standards and interfaces that are so well defined in</i><br>
<i>the Macintosh desktop metaphor don't exist when you're creating interactive electronic</i><br>
<i>magazines (Hyperzines). </i> Developer Essentials<i> is a living document. It will</i><br>
<i>continually grow and change as we begin to determine what works (and what</i><br>
<i>doesn't)--things like how you use sound, how and when you should animate an icon,</i><br>
<i>what's the best use of color, where is the best place within the virtual magazine</i><br>
<i>metaphor to put a control panel windoid and have it not be a complete pain. Ya know,</i><br>
<i>things like that.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The reason we've put the automatic feedback capabilities into</i> d e v e l o p<i> is to get your</i><br>
<i>ideas, criticisms, and thoughts. We don't have all the answers and will be</i><br>
<i>experimenting with new ways of representing data. We hope to have more defined and</i><br>
<i>stable human interface standards regarding the use of electronic media like CD-ROM in</i><br>
<i>the near future. In the meantime, look for experimentation, a few mistakes, and some</i><br>
<i>very open minds looking to you for feedback and suggestions here at Apple.</i><br>

Issue 2 of <i>d e v e l o p </i>is great.&nbsp;&nbsp;The articles are fun, informative, and well written. I<br>
think you are off to a great start.
</p>
<p>
But I must strenuously object to your rampant waste of paper for the sake of "design."<br>
Almost every page has at least 25 percent white space; many have more. I don't know if<br>
you have an aversion to trees or just a lack of concern for our children, but your<br>
choice in this matter does not reflect Apple's generally ecological view.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple is a<br>
leader in reducing waste in manufacturing, but you insist on creating waste in your<br>
magazine.
</p>
<p>
Please, please take a look at redesigning your pages for future issues. Apple's<br>
publications are often very well designed, but yours is the only one that screams<br>
"paper waste"&nbsp;&nbsp;on every page. It is an easy step that will help the whole world.<br>
--Paul Hoffman

<i>I'm looking into using recycled paper for </i> d e v e l o p<i> (in fact, it started out as a</i><br>
<i>requirement for the first issue), but I've run into conflicting information. I recycle</i><br>
<i>my paper (both here at work and at home) and am actively looking for ways to help </i> d e<br>
v e l o p<i> fit into the ecological scheme of things. Our printer recycles all of the waste</i><br>
<i>(generated from printer make-ready, and overages), and the paper we print on, like</i><br>
<i>most paper these days, has a recycled component. Some people I've spoken to advocate</i><br>
<i>recycled paper as the answer to all of our problems; others contend that the chemicals</i><br>
<i>used to de-ink the paper damage the environment more than they help to save it. If</i><br>
<i>you've got ideas about whom I could talk to to hear the real scoop on recycled paper</i><br>
<i>(from environmental impact to lasting&nbsp;&nbsp;qualities), I'd love to hear them.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Meanwhile the page design is intended to leave room for notes (which many developers</i><br>
<i>have told me they make), and for readability. The column widths must allow for</i><br>
<i>full-page width code listings but must also work with readable line lengths. I'm sorry</i><br>
<i>that it screams paper waste to you, and I will talk to our designer about ways in which</i><br>
<i>we might adapt the design.</i><br>

<p>
<b>STEPS BACK</b><br>
When we find technical errors in previous issues of <i>d e v e l o p </i>(or when you point<br>
them out to us), we make corrections in the text and code for the current <i> Developer</i><br>
<i>Essentials </i> disc. You can also find corrections in this section of the journal.
</p>
<p>
So far, we want to let you know about these changes:
</p>
<p>
On page 75, the abstract should read "Through the Slot Manager system software, the<br>
Macintosh can read the declaration ROMs in NuBus slots and processor slots, like those<br>
in the Macintosh SE/30. This article tells you what you must know about NuBus<br>
addressing and the structure of correct declaration ROMs to successfully debug the<br>
ROM. It walks you through the structure of an example declaration ROM and gives<br>
common errors and strategies for debugging declaration ROMs."
</p>
<p>
On page 91, "Assuming the board is in slot $B, the above format block (residing on<br>
byte lane 3)" should be byte lane 0.
</p>
<p>
On page 149, the procedure <code>MyVScrollCallback </code>appears twice. The second one should<br>
have been<code> MyHScrollCallback</code>, as indicated in the comments. Thanks to Sam Roberts<br>
for pointing this one out. For those of you who didn't even notice, shame on you.
</p>
<p>
<i>There was a pair of bugs in the "Heap Demo" source code distributed with&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 2 of</i><br>
<i>develop, one of which prevented the source code from compiling. The </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Developer<br>
Essentials<i> disc contains a corrected version (HeapDemo 1.3.4) In order to compile the</i><br>
<i>old code, you should remove the reference to "UMonitor" at the start of HeapDemo.p.</i><br>
<i>The UMonitor unit is a debugging tool that was used during the final checkout of the</i><br>
<i>Heap Demo, and though I removed the calls to its code, I forgot to remove the USES</i><br>
<i>reference.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The other bug was in the menu enabling logic. With the bug, you could crash the</i><br>
<i>program by closing the memory window, and deleting all blocks. The menu enabling</i><br>
<i>logic has been changed to fix this problem. Thanks to the diligent readers who pointed</i><br>
<i>out these problems. I'll make sure you have more articles to nit-pick in the future!</i><br>
