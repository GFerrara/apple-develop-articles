<h2>APPLE II Q&amp;A</h2>
<h1>APPLE II DEVLELOPER TECHNICAL SUPPORT</h1>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>How can I get back to my program from the Init version of GSBug?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The new version of GSBug, available from APDA in a beta version, comes with an Init<br>
file which installs the debugger to be present in the background, invocable with the<br>
keystrokes control-command-option-Escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;The command to quit the application<br>
version of GSBug ("Q") does not work from the Init version; the correct command is<br>
"R" (for "resume").&nbsp;&nbsp;If you break on a tool call, be sure to take tool breaks out before<br>
doing any tracing if you hope to not die a different horrible death than the one your<br>
application would normally have given you.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>I've heard about a version of SANE for eight-bit Apple II computers, but I can't find</i><br>
<i>it anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it still sold?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>SANE is considered part of the System Software and is distributed by Apple's<br>
Software Licensing group.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may contact them at (408) 974-4667 or through<br>
AppleLink address SW.LICENSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although older versions of SANE were sold as part of<br>
Apple's old "WorkBench" series, the current version should be obtained from Software<br>
Licensing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you own an older copy of SANE you wish to use in your program, it<br>
still must be licensed from Software Licensing before distributing it. SANE is built in<br>
to all IIgs and Macintosh computers.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>What file type should I use for my program's files?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Apple II Developer Technical Support assigns file type and auxiliary type<br>
combinations to developers by request.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple II DTS must assign file types and<br>
auxiliary types, rather than arbitrate as Macintosh DTS does, since the range of Apple<br>
II file types is much more limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please refer to "About Apple II File Type Notes"<br>
(included on CD or available from APDA) for information on how to submit a request<br>
for an assignment, as well as for a complete listing of all currently assigned file type<br>
and auxiliary type assignments.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>What is "FASTFONT" and how can I use it?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>FASTFONT is a new disk file for System Software 5.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;It contains a pre-shifted<br>
version of the ROM font, Shaston 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;QuickDraw will load FASTFONT from theFonts<br>
directory at&nbsp;&nbsp;QDStartUp time (if present) and use it for greatly increased text drawing<br>
speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the System does not support different or multiple FastFonts, and no<br>
special work is needed by the application to take advantage of the present capability.</p><p><b>Q</b>
<i>What is ExpressLoad and how do I use it?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>ExpressLoad works with the System Loader to load specially prepared (or<br>
"Expressed") files much faster than the System Loader does.&nbsp;&nbsp;Files may be prepared to<br>
work with ExpressLoad by using the APW tool "Express", the MPW IIgs tool<br>
"ExpressIIgs", or a linker that can automatically create Expressed files. If your file is<br>
not Expressed, it will work just fine with System Software 5.0; it just won't load as<br>
fast as Expressed files will.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Expressed files will load properly when<br>
ExpressLoad is not present.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, some considerations that should be<br>
made when working with Expressed files.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are detailed in the Apple IIgs<br>
Technical Note "ExpressLoad Philosophy".
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>My program uses option-key equivalents for certain functions, and they no longer</i><br>
<i>work under System Software 5.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;How come?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>(This is the kind of specific question with lots of details that DTS really likes.)<br>
System Software 5.0 includes a new key translation feature very similar to that found<br>
on the Macintosh.&nbsp;&nbsp;The feature allows special characters to be typed by pressing<br>
option-key keystokes.&nbsp;&nbsp;(For example, the &#402; character can be generated by typing<br>
option-f.) This will interfere with programs that already use&nbsp;&nbsp;option-key equivalents.<br>
Your program will not get the keydown event for option-f; you'll get an unmodified<br>
keydown event for the ASCII code for "&#402;".&nbsp;&nbsp;This feature may be controlled through new<br>
Event Manager calls, and may also be deactivated by using the "Translation" option of<br>
the "Alphabet" CDev in the Control Panel NDA.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>I noticed the Finder is now using application-specific strings for the "kind" of a file.</i><br>
<i>How can I use this capability?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The Finder on System Software 5.0 uses a new data structure known as a File Type<br>
Descriptor to allow a string to be matched with a particular file type and auxiliary<br>
type.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like icon files, multiple File Type Descriptor files may be used, so strings may<br>
be "added" to the Finder's vocabulary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Details on the data structure and the Finder's<br>
implementation are in Apple II File Type Note for FileType $42.
