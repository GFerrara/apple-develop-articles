<h2>MACINTOSH DISPLAY CARD 8*24 GC: THE NAKED TRUTH</h2>
<h1>GUILLERMO ORTIZ</h1>
<p>
<i>The Macintosh Display Card 8*24 GC, which supports monitors with depths up to 24</i><br>
<i>bits per pixel, allows use of a special version of 32-Bit QuickDraw that improves</i><br>
<i>drawing performance on computers in the Macintosh II family. This article details the</i><br>
<i>new card's features, describes how third-party developers can make sure their</i><br>
<i>products are compatible, and tells how to take advantage of the card and its software. </i>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Since the invention of the first computer, users and developers have been complaining<br>
about the amount of memory available, the speed of the machine, or the number of<br>
things that could be done at the same time. (Do you remember when 16K was<br>
considered a lot of memory? Of course not.)
</p>
<p>
The new Macintosh Display Card 8*24 GC addresses the perennial issue of speed,<br>
specifically the speed with which the Macintosh executes drawing commands. With its<br>
on-board processor and accompanying software, the new 8*24 GC card can execute<br>
QuickDraw TM commands from 5 to 30 times faster than standard 32-Bit QuickDraw.
</p>
<p>
The Macintosh Display Card 8*24 GC has two independent components: the circuitry<br>
that controls the display and the hardware and software that accelerate&nbsp;&nbsp;32-Bit<br>
QuickDraw.
</p>
<p>
<b>DISPLAY NUTS AND BOLTS</b><br>
We'll start with the display circuitry of the Macintosh Display Card 8*24 GC, which<br>
closely matches the behavior of the Macintosh Display Card 8*24. Figure 1 shows the<br>
principal components.

</p>
<p>
<b>Programmable Pixel Clock</b> At boot time the card detects the monitor being used<br>
and programs this chip to generate the signal that defines the period for refreshing<br>

</p>
<p>
<b>MONITOR SUPPORT</b><br>
The new card supports all Apple monitors, including the Apple 13-Inch (B/W &amp;<br>
Color) monitor, the Apple Portrait Display, and the Apple Two-Page Display.
</p>
<p>
The Macintosh Display Card 8*24 GC connects to a monitor through a DB-15<br>
connector and, via the sense lines, detects the type of monitor to which it is connected.<br>
At boot time the card senses the monitor and configures itself for it. Third<br>
party-monitors with sense lines that are compatible with Apple standards should work<br>
as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;One important difference between the 8*24 GC card and its companion<br>
Macintosh Display Card 8*24 is that the 8*24 GC does not fall back into a dormant<br>
state when it finds no monitor connected during boot time. To allow for cases when<br>
users may want to have an 8*24 GC to accelerate output to other monitors, but don't<br>
want to connect a monitor to the card, the 8*24 GC card remains active, allowing<br>
8*24 GC software to operate.
</p>
<p>
<b>DEPTH SUPPORT</b><br>
The 8*24 GC card supports depths of up to 8 bits for all monitors and 24-bit color for<br>
the 13-inch monitor (and RS-170A and PAL monitors). The 8-bit-per-pixel support<br>
for all Apple monitors implies, among other things, that true gray-scale output is<br>
possible with both the Apple Portrait Display and the Apple Two-Page Display.
</p>
<p>
On a high-resolution (13-inch) monitor, the 8*24 GC card can display 24 bits of<br>
color per pixel. As many people have noted (repeatedly), with this level of depth<br>
support, applications can display more colors than most human eyes can discern.
</p>
<p>
<b>NUBUS BLOCK TRANSFERS</b><br>
The new card uses NuBus TM block transfers to accelerate display in other display<br>
buffers present in the system. The Macintosh Display Card 8*24 GC is a NuBus master<br>
card. When it detects other cards in the system that can accept block transfer calls, the<br>
card uses block transfer mode to improve the performance of QuickDraw operations all<br>
across the board. For video buffer cards that do not support block transfer mode, the<br>
Macintosh Display Card 8*24 GC uses a special pseudo block transfer to optimize video<br>
performance.
</p>
<p>
Hardware developers should take special interest in designing cards that will make use<br>
of the block transfer mode, which will allow them to squeeze the most performance out<br>
of NuBus. The 8*24 GC card can receive block transfers (acting as slave), so other<br>
cards that may move data to the card's memory can move the data faster. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;This is probably a good place to emphasize that, although you can have as many 8*24<br>
GC boards as you want (or as many as you can afford), only one will function as a<br>
graphics accelerator. At boot time QuickDraw GC uses the card in the lowest slot. Any<br>
other 8*24 GC card becomes a glorified display card that is basically equivalent to the<br>
Macintosh Display Card 8*24.
</p>
<p>
<b>VIDEO SIGNALS</b><br>
The RS-170A standard video signals produced by the 8*24 GC card allow you to<br>
connect computers in the Macintosh II family to NTSC devices. Note, however, that the<br>
RS-170A signals are not directly NTSC compatible. A box is necessary to produce<br>
NTSC output that can be displayed on a standard television set or used along with other<br>
video equipment such as a VCR.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can generate NTSC black-and-white output by<br>
making a cable that uses the green video signal (which also carries a sync pulse), as<br>
shown in Figure 2.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2</b> Simple NTSC B/W Connector
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;When displaying images Macintosh monitors refresh all the scan lines every time<br>
they refresh the screen. This process is called noninterlaced video. RS-170A<br>
monitors, which are interlaced devices, can scan only half the lines during each<br>
vertical scan. Every other line is "repainted" every time the screen is refreshed.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Interlaced video is reasonably good for pictures and images in general, but really poor<br>
for the display of thin horizontal lines, which seem to flicker when repainted only<br>
every other scan. Because the Macintosh desktop is ordinarily full of such lines, the<br>
desktop looks bad when displayed on interlaced devices. To overcome this problem, the<br>
RS-170A output of the 8*24 GC card uses a technique called Apple convolution. The<br>
technique is basically a filter that, before displaying a scan line, averages each line<br>
with the line above and the line below. This filter is applied to all depths except direct<br>
RGB (24 bits per pixel) when the card is operating in RS-170A mode (see Figure 3).
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3</b> Convolution Filter Weights for Interlaced Video
</p>
<p>
<b>PAL-COMPATIBLE SIGNALS</b><br>
The Macintosh Display Card 8*24 GC also produces video signals that are compatible<br>
with PAL timings. These signals can be used to produce PAL output&nbsp;&nbsp;to drive video<br>
devices of the type used in most European countries.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The PAL-compatible signals have the same characteristics as the RS-170A output;<br>
that is, the output is interlaced. For settings of 1 to 8 bits deep, a convolution filter&nbsp;&nbsp;is<br>
applied before each line is produced. The PAL output mode is triggered through one of<br>
the extended sense-line configurations, as described in the accompanying sidebar,<br>
"Extended Sense Line Protocol."
</p>
<h2>EXTENDED SENSE LINE PROTOCOL</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;The Sense Line Protocol was implemented when Apple recognized the need for a<br>
mechanism that would allow a display card to identify the monitor connected to it. For<br>
example, the Macintosh IIci display circuitry and the Macintosh 8*24 and 8*24 GC<br>
display cards can now configure themselves according to the monitor that is connected<br>
at boot time. The identification scheme works fine, but there is one problem. Three<br>
sense lines limit the number of different monitors to seven. To overcome this<br>
limitation, newer display cards use an extension to the sense line scheme that allows<br>
for 28 new codes.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The extension is based on the following idea: When&nbsp;&nbsp;the display circuitry senses a<br>
configuration that in the original scheme signals "no display connected" (in other<br>
words, when all three sense lines are not connected), the card pulls down each sense<br>
line, one by one, and reads back what the other lines return. To return a unique code,<br>
the only requirement is that the sense lines be connected, in the cable or the monitor<br>
itself, by wires or diodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of this idea is that existing monitors are detected<br>
correctly. Newer monitors can have their own encoding, and the circuitry for detecting<br>
new monitors is relatively simple. Since there are no active components, adding the<br>
encoding to new or existing monitors involves only a few inexpensive diodes and a little<br>
wire.

<h2>GC QUICKDRAW: SPIRIT STRONGER THAN FLESH</h2>
<p>
Software for the Macintosh Display Card 8*24 GC is made up of three main<br>
components (see Figure 5).
</p>
<ul>
<li> GC QuickDraw: An optimized version of 32-Bit QuickDraw tailored for<br>
the best performance on the Am29000 processor.</li>
<li> The Am29000 kernel (also referred to as GC OS): The software in the<br>
card that takes care of scheduling the execution of GC QuickDraw; also manages<br>
memory on the card.</li>
<li> IPC Software: The communication mechanism between the 680x0<br>
environment and the GC QuickDraw software. For maximum performance, the<br>
IPC software was designed to deal only with&nbsp;&nbsp;QuickDraw operations, thus<br>
limiting the overhead. The software intercepts QuickDraw drawing commands<br>
and redirects them to GC QuickDraw on the card, buffering commands when<br>
needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img src="img/190.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 5</b>Software Architecture of the 8*24 GC Card
</p>
<p>
All these components come in a single file called 8*24 GC, which must be moved to the<br>
System Folder as a single-step installation process. At boot time, after the "Welcome<br>
to Macintosh" screen appears, the System looks for the file and, when it finds it,<br>
installs the GC software as a transparent upgrade to 32-Bit QuickDraw. The<br>
installation consists of loading the GC QuickDraw code into the card memory, loading<br>
the GC kernel (GC OS) and initializing its structures, and loading and initializing the<br>
IPC software. At INIT time, the rocket icon appears to indicate the presence of the GC<br>
software in the System.
</p>
<p>
The 8*24 GC file contains a Control Panel device that allows the user to turn<br>
acceleration on and off.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE HAND IS QUICKER THAN THE EYE</b><br>
A good way to start the discussion of GC QuickDraw is by separating QuickDraw calls<br>
into two global classes. The first class consists of the "drawing" commands-- LineTo<br>
and FrameRect, for example. The second class consists of the "state"-oriented calls,<br>
such as SetPenState andRGBForeColor.
</p>
<p>
<b>DRAWING CALLS</b><br>
When 32-Bit QuickDraw is running the show, all drawing commands cause one of the<br>
standard QuickDraw bottleneck procedures to be called. For example, calling PaintRect<br>
causes StdRect to be called, and calling FillPoly ends up invoking StdPoly. "Under" the<br>
bottleneck procedures, QuickDraw takes the commands and goes into a set of calls that<br>
execute commands based on the type of drawing taking place. The lowest level for<br>
QuickDraw is the code that actually draws to the devices affected by the drawing that is<br>
being executed.The software for the 8*24 GC card takes effect at the level immediately<br>
under the standard (bottleneck) procedures. If DrawChar is called, for example,<br>
QuickDraw checks to see if the CQDProcs field in the current port is nil and, if so,<br>
calls the StdText routine. At this point the IPC software intercepts the call and passes<br>
the request to GC QuickDraw to initiate the accelerated process.
</p>
<p>
The previous paragraph points to an important fact: If an application completely<br>
replaces the standard bottleneck procedures, it is effectively turning acceleration&nbsp;&nbsp;off.<br>
Ordinarily standard bottleneck procedures are completely replaced only when driving<br>
nondisplay devices such as printers, so there is no conflict with the acceleration<br>
scheme. But some applications may bypass QuickDraw completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;By doing so they<br>
forgo the benefits of accelerated QuickDraw.
</p>
<p>
When the IPC takes control, it handshakes with the card kernel, queues the command in<br>
the asynchronous buffer, and returns control to the application. From the application's<br>
point of view, the call to QuickDraw returns almost immediately and allows the<br>
application to continue its execution. This parallelism reduces the apparent time it<br>
takes QuickDraw to perform a drawing operation. Performance is also enhanced<br>
because, while GC QuickDraw is performing the task, the application can be busy<br>
calculating whatever is necessary for the next call.
</p>
<p>
When GC QuickDraw processes one command from the queue, two paths are available. If<br>
the target is the current port, and if no changes have been made, GC QuickDraw goes<br>
ahead and does the drawing; it has in its cache everything it needs. On the other hand, if<br>
the target is a different port, or if the current port has changed, GC QuickDraw<br>
proceeds to import the necessary parameters from main memory, set its own<br>
structures, and finally do the actual drawing. In this discussion, we've used the<br>
word<i>port,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;but the same principle applies to any change if the destination is aGWorld<br>
or if theGDeviceassociated with the destination has changed. 
</p>
<p>
The application can issue as many drawing commands as necessary. The IPC software<br>
buffers them as needed, and GC QuickDraw completes all operations as quickly as it<br>
can. The result is a completely asynchronous operation that gives applications the<br>
fastest responsiveness and frees more processor time for application calculations<br>
(applications have more time to think!).
</p>
<p>
There are some exceptions to the complete asynchronous scheme. Calls (such as<br>
CopyBits) that involve not only the destination port/device combination, but also<br>
different source and destination environments, make it necessary to flush the queue by<br>
processing all pending operations and then performing the setup for the call. Once the<br>
CopyBits call has been initiated, it is executed in parallel for optimum performance.<br>
Software developers should note that using GWorlds to buffer PixMapsmakes CopyBits<br>
intrinsically faster.
</p>
<p>
<b>PARAMETER-CHANGING ("STATE") CALLS</b><br>
The Macintosh Display Card 8*24 GC acceleration mechanism concerns itself mainly<br>
with the drawing class of calls. Parameter-changing calls also have an important<br>
effect on the overall performance of GC QuickDraw. The 8*24 GC software does not<br>
work in its own environment, but heavily relies on the global structures that<br>
QuickDraw keeps in main memory.
</p>
<p>
Instead of loading all the parameters with every call, GC QuickDraw caches all the data<br>
structures it needs, but has to reload the data when changes are detected. Some of the<br>
structures cached by GC QuickDraw are color tables, GDevices, GWorlds, PixPats,<br>
Fonts, and Width Tables. Changing the pen or modifying the foreground color, for<br>
example, invalidates the cached data. To squeeze the maximum out of the 8*24 GC card,<br>
it is therefore important to group calls that draw elements with shared characteristics<br>
(same color, same pattern, and so forth) instead of constantly changing port<br>
parameters between drawing calls.
</p>
<p>
Changing directly any structure maintained and used by QuickDraw has always been a<br>
clear and dangerous compatibility risk. The 8*24 GC software cannot detect changes to<br>
the drawing environment unless you use the proper calls to accomplish such changes. 
</p>
<p>
Not all QuickDraw calls are redirected when acceleration is enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceleration<br>
affects only calls that either perform drawing operations or change the state of<br>
QuickDraw structures. A list of such calls follows.

<p>
<b>THE DEVELOPER POINT OF VIEW</b><br>
The best feature of the Macintosh Display Card 8*24 GC is that application developers<br>
have little to worry about when it comes to compatibility. You must put forth some<br>
effort to do something in an application that GC QuickDraw cannot straighten out.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The one area that may require some rewriting is changing the way an application<br>
allocates offscreen drawing environments (see "Braving Offscreen Worlds" in&nbsp;&nbsp;d e v e l<br>
o p , issue 1). When a GDevice is created by hand (instead of by a call&nbsp;&nbsp;to NewGWorld),<br>
all the structures are kept in main memory. Drawing to this environment and then<br>
using CopyBits to display the result takes a greater number of NuBus transfers.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;When a drawing operation that involves a GWorld occurs, GC QuickDraw immediately<br>
caches the complete GWorld structure in the card's memory if the structure has not<br>
yet been cached and if sufficient memory is available. (The card's optional DRAM kit is<br>
an important addition for applications that work with large GWorlds.) When CopyBits<br>
is called to display the results, the transfer of pixels to the screen driven by the 8*24<br>
GC card is therefore really fast because there is no NuBus transfer. Even displaying<br>
the image into other monitors benefits, especially when the other cards can accept<br>
block transfers. Drawing operations to and from GWorlds can be executed in parallel.<br>
This is not the case when drawing to or from old-style offscreens (see Figures 6 and<br>
7).
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/191.gif" width="575 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 6</b> Offscreen Old Style
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;When applications create offscreen environments by hand, GC QuickDraw<br>
performance is affected because the data has to go many more times across NuBus. For<br>
example, if an application draws to an offscreen port and then calls CopyBits to display<br>
the results on the screen, the following happens:
</p>
<ol>
<li> IPC passes the drawing command to GC QuickDraw.</li>
<li> GC QuickDraw does the drawing across the Nubus to buffer.</li>
<li> The application waits for the completion signal.</li>
<li> IPC passes the CopyBits call to GC QuickDraw.</li>
<li> GC QuickDraw copies from main memory...</li>
<li> ...to the frame buffer.</li>
</ol>
<p>
&nbsp;Finally, QuickDraw operates more efficiently when thePixMap's rowBytesis a<br>
multiple of four (long word alignment). It just happens that whenNewGWorld is called<br>
it creates the offscreenPixMapin such a fashion, which increases the performance of<br>
QuickDraw even when the offscreen buffer could be in main memory.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/192.gif" width="587 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 7</b> OffscreenGWorlds
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;When an application uses GWorlds to buffer the display, GC QuickDraw can use the<br>
cached data in its memory and minimize NuBus traffic. The steps are as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> IPC passes the draw command and returns control to the application<br>
immediately.</li>
<li> GC QuickDraw executes the command as soon as possible.</li>
<li> IPC passes the CopyBits call and returns.</li>
<li> GC QuickDraw moves pixels from the local copy of the GWorld to the<br>
screen buffer while the application does its stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;COMPATIBILITY ISSUES</b><br>
As mentioned earlier, GC QuickDraw is port oriented, which suggests that to improve<br>
performance it caches the port's structure in its entirety while drawing to a port. The<br>
implication is that, if an application draws to different ports in an alternating fashion,<br>
the application is forcing GC QuickDraw to flush its asynchronous buffer and move data<br>
from main memory with each drawing command.&nbsp;&nbsp;To get the best performance from GC<br>
QuickDraw, a good programming technique&nbsp;&nbsp;is to bundle all drawing operations that<br>
affect a given port and complete them before changing ports to do some more drawing.<br>
As noted earlier, it is also important to&nbsp;&nbsp;put together all the calls that affect a single<br>
port and share characteristics such&nbsp;&nbsp;as color, pattern, and pen. The same admonition<br>
applies to GWorlds because&nbsp;&nbsp;GC QuickDraw caches the GWorld into its memory when a<br>
GWorld is the destination of a drawing operation. Changing GWorlds and drawing to<br>
each one&nbsp;&nbsp;in rapid succession means that GC QuickDraw has to keep flushing its<br>
asynchronous buffer and moving the necessary data from memory, which could imply<br>
copying&nbsp;&nbsp;the new GWorld, including its PixMap&nbsp;&nbsp;(and 32-bit PixMaps can be a lot of<br>
bytes to move).
</p>
<p>
<b>BOTTLENECKS AND STRUCTURE CHANGES</b><br>
As mentioned earlier, two areas make life difficult for an application running under GC<br>
QuickDraw. These areas are replacing the bottleneck procedures and changing<br>
QuickDraw structures directly.
</p>
<p>
<b>Replacing bottleneck procedures.</b> Replacing the standard bottleneck procedures<br>
is a time-honored tradition in the Macintosh world. The problem is that, if an<br>
application replaces a standard procedure and does not end up calling the original<br>
default trap after it finishes its manipulations, the application is turning off<br>
acceleration. Whenever possible--and if acceleration is desired--the application&nbsp;&nbsp;that<br>
replaces the standard bottleneck procedures should call the original through the trap<br>
dispatcher before returning to the main program.
</p>
<p>
<b>Changing QuickDraw structures.</b> The dangers of messing up with QuickDraw<br>
structures directly are well known to all. Nevertheless, some applications still go<br>
about happily changing structures. As a rule, you should call the ToolBox whenever<br>
possible to change the state of the drawing environment. When the need is too strong,<br>
use the calls that alert QuickDraw to the changes you're making.
</p>
<p>
<b>TIMING</b><br>
One interesting compatibility problem is not uniquely tied to the 8*24 GC card but has<br>
to do with faster hardware in general. Some techniques still being used are direct<br>
descendants of routines that were implemented for the 64K Macintosh. Now, with new<br>
machines, these techniques simply run too fast.
</p>
<p>
One example is the "marching ants" technique of repeatedly callingFrameRect, with<br>
each repetition shifting a pattern 1 bit to create a rippling frame on the screen. The<br>
trick is still valid, but now causes a problem. In the time it took the Ol' Macintosh to<br>
make four passes through theFrameRectloop, a newer Macintosh can make hundreds of<br>
passes. With 8*24 GC acceleration on, the number is even greater. The result is that<br>
the marching becomes jerky and annoying, and the cursor tends to disappear,<br>
becauseHideCursoris being called to complete theFrameRectcall. The cursor appears<br>
and disappears so quickly that it becomes invisible. 
</p>
<p>
Do not time loops based on the performance of a given machine. For any form of<br>
animation, use the Time Manager routines to time your application.
</p>
<p>
<b>DRAWING DIRECTLY TO THE SCREEN</b><br>
As a final admonition,<i> do not draw directly to the screen</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;. Drawing directly to the <br>
screen puts any application at immediate compatibility risk with 32-Bit QuickDraw<br>
and with all Apple and third-party 24-bit video cards. Drawing directly into the<br>
8*24 GC card's display buffer will probably cause crashes and, at the minimum,<br>
create weird artifacts if both the application and GC QuickDraw are drawing at the<br>
same time.
</p>
<p>
<b>PROGRAMMING THE Am29000 (NOPE!)</b><br>
No, you can not program the Am29000 yourself. At the moment of this writing,<br>
third-party applications cannot make direct use of the Am29000 processor for any<br>
purpose.
</p>
<p>
The good news is that Apple recognizes the burning desires developers have to use the<br>
Am29000 for more than accelerating QuickDraw, and future releases of the software<br>
may provide such capability.&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you have a brilliant idea, Apple wants to know<br>
about it. Although implementation details are not yet available, you can start by<br>
sending a message that describes what you want to do and what kind of support you hope<br>
the GC software can give you.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Send these and any other comments about programming the Am29000 on the 8*24 GC<br>
card to AppleLink address FAST.GRAPHIC. Apple will get back to you when more<br>
information is available.

<b>NOTEWORTHY CALLS</b><br>
One piece of software that has not been mentioned is the 8*24 GC cdev. With it users<br>
can turn acceleration on and off through the Control Panel. Although turning<br>
acceleration on and off should be left under the control of the user, you may want to<br>
provide users with some kind of on/off dialog box or menu option. The <i> Developer</i><br>
<i>Essentials</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;disc (this issue) contains the GraphAccel.o file, an MPW library that<br>
accomplishes this task. A sample FKey for turning acceleration on and off is included<br>
with the library.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;A new call was implemented with 32-Bit QuickDraw to allow an application to<br>
determine whether a drawing operation initiated by it, and affecting a given port, has<br>
been finished:
</p>
<p>
<code>Function QDDone(pPtr: CGrafPtr): Boolean;</code>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;This call may be of especially good use if you're interested in timing each individual<br>
call. It may also be of use in some animation situations, such as when you want to<br>
initiate the next drawing action only after execution of a prior call has definitely<br>
concluded.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;QDDone returns FALSE if QuickDraw is in the process of drawing to pPtr and TRUE<br>
when QuickDraw is done.&nbsp;&nbsp;If pPtr is nil, QDDone returns TRUE only when drawing to<br>
all ports is completed. Note that when nil is passed to the call, background processes<br>
such as clocks could prevent QDDone from ever returning TRUE.
</p>
<pre>Function QDDone(pPtr: CGrafPtr): Boolean;
INLINE $203C, $0004, $0013, $AB1D;{     Move.l #$00040013,D0
                                                        _QDOffscreen
                                                   }</pre>

<b>FINALLY</b><br>
The Macintosh Display Card 8*24 GC is Apple Engineering's response to the demands<br>
for enhanced graphics performance for the Macintosh family of computers. Designers<br>
of graphics- intensive applications now can concentrate on the algorithms that will<br>
improve overall performance instead of using design resources to squeeze the last<br>
drops of display speed, a choice which often compromises compatibility and ease of use.
</p>
<p>
Developers get the benefits of the 8*24 GC card with almost no programming hit.<br>
Coding of special routines to achieve faster performance is unnecessary. Following old,<br>
simple QuickDraw rules, developers can be assured of faster graphics performance at<br>
no extra cost.
</p>
<h2>ALERTING QUICKDRAW TO CHANGES</h2>
<p>
Applications can use the calls listed here to make QuickDraw and GC QuickDraw aware<br>
of direct changes to forbidden structures.
</p>
<p>
<code>PROCEDURE CTabChanged (ctab: CTabHandle)</code> This call says, "Yes, I know I<br>
shouldn't mess&nbsp;&nbsp;with a color table directly, but I did it, and I want to come clean." Use<br>
SetEntries, or--even better--let the Palette Manager maintain the color table for<br>
you.
</p>
<p>
<code>PROCEDURE PixPatChanged (ppat: PixPatHandle);</code>Use this call to say, "I admit I<br>
modified the&nbsp;&nbsp;fields of a PixPat directly. Please fix the resulting mess for me." When<br>
the modifications include changing the contents of the color table pointed to by<br>
PixPat.patMap^^ .pmTable, you should also call CTabChanged.PenPixPat and<br>
BackPixPat are better ways to install new patterns.
</p>
<p>
<code>PROCEDURE PortChanged (port: GrafPtr);</code>You should not modify any of the port<br>
structures directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you cannot control yourself, use this call to let QuickDraw<br>
know what you have done.
</p>
<p>
If you modify either the PixPat or the color table associated with the port, you need to<br>
call PixPatChangedand CTabChanged.
</p>
<p>
<code>PROCEDURE GDeviceChanged (gdh: GDHandle);</code>The best practice is to stay away<br>
from the fields of&nbsp;&nbsp;any GDevice. But if you do change something, make this call to<br>
rectify any problems. If you change the color table data in the device's PixMap, you<br>
must also call CTabChanged.
