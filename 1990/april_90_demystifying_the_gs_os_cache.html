<h2>DEMYSTIFYING THE GS/OS CACHE</h2>

<h1>MATT DEATHERAGE</h1>
<p>
<i>GS/OS has given Apple IIgs users an important capability: caching.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the newly</i><br>
<i>initiated, the mysteries of the GS/OS cache may still seem profound. This article</i><br>
<i>clarifies the basics of the caching algorithm and offers useful pointers for working</i><br>
<i>safely and efficiently.</i>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In the past couple of years, the Apple IIgs system software has grown by leaps and<br>
bounds. With the introduction of thousands of new features and capabilities, one very<br>
important one often goes unnoticed. GS/OS is the first Apple II operating system of any<br>
kind to provide a comprehensive caching implementation.
</p>
<p>
Although the cache is an important part of GS/OS, its purpose and nature are<br>
sometimes misunderstood. Some people create huge caches in the hope that peripherals<br>
will start behaving like RAM disks. Others set the cache size to zero because they think<br>
it's wasting time and memory. Some developers mistakenly believe their program has<br>
absolute control over caching, which is only true if they're writing device drivers.<br>
This article reaches into the murky depths of your IIgs's memory and allows you to<br>
examine the cache in the light you would normally use, say, to read&nbsp;&nbsp;develop by.
</p>
<h2>CACHE FUNDAMENTALS</h2>
<p>
Let's start at the beginning, with the basics. What's a cache? How is it managed? How<br>
big is it? How does the GS/OS cache differ from that of the Macintosh? Read on.
</p>
<p>
<b>WHAT'S A CACHE?</b><br>
A cache is a part of memory in which the operating system can keep a spare copy&nbsp;&nbsp;of<br>
information read from and written to a device, in an attempt to decrease disk access<br>
time.
</p>
<p>
Many people use RAM disks to decrease disk access time. Because the operating system<br>
doesn't actually have to physically manipulate any media to access information on a<br>
RAM disk, the information is saved and retrieved at a very nice clip, exceeded only by<br>
the speed at which the operating system can read information already in main memory.<br>
In a caching algorithm, that is exactly what happens.
</p>
<p>
When information is read from a device, the operating system reads from the physical<br>
media and returns the information to the caller who asked for it. Additionally, the<br>
operating system keeps a spare copy of the information in the cache. The next time a<br>
caller requests information, the operating system first looks in the cache to see if it<br>
already has it from a previous media access. If it's there, the operating system simply<br>
moves the data into the caller's buffer, completing the call without having to actually<br>
read anything from disk.
</p>
<p>
Information to be written can also be cached. The operating system writes the<br>
information to the disk and also writes it to the cache. This method, called a<br>
write-through cache, ensures that the information in the cache is never more recent<br>
than the information on the disk. GS/OS uses a write- through cache except in one<br>
special situation--during a write-deferral session.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE CACHE MANAGER AND WHAT IT CACHES</b><br>
In GS/OS, several distinct managers handle different parts of the operating system or<br>
environment. Many of these managers (the Loader and the Device Manager, for<br>
example) are familiar to application and driver authors. Another, more obscure<br>
manager takes care of the cache; plainly enough, it's called the Cache Manager. The<br>
Cache Manager handles the storage of the cache and all requests involving it.
</p>
<p>
The GS/OS Cache Manager only caches one thing: blocks. Blocks are what both generated<br>
and loaded drivers read from block devices. They can be traditional ProDOS-sized<br>
512-byte blocks from traditional ProDOS devices; they can be 512-byte blocks from<br>
nontraditional ProDOS devices, such as network volumes or nondisk devices; or they<br>
can be odd-sized blocks from odd peripherals. If you had a GS/OS loaded driver to read<br>
981-byte blocks from a 20-gigahertz, 35-terabyte RAM disk hooked to your Apple<br>
IIgs through a slot-based card, GS/OS could cache those blocks. (Whether or not any<br>
file system translators in the system could use the device is another story.) The Cache<br>
Manager does not cache anything having to do with printers, modems, or other<br>
character devices.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE SIZE OF THE CACHE</b><br>
The size of the cache is determined by a battery RAM (BRAM) parameter. When the<br>
Cache Manager is initialized as part of the GS/OS boot process, it retrieves this value<br>
from the battery backed-up RAM and adjusts so that the given value is taken as the <br>
<i>maximum </i> size to which the cache can grow. The BRAM parameter is currently<br>
number $81 and represents the cache size in 32K increments (a value of 2 would<br>
indicate 64K). You should know that the location and interpretation of the cache size<br>
parameter are not guaranteed at this point, and relying on the location or<br>
interpretation of the parameter might get you into trouble. When they are guaranteed,<br>
Apple II Developer Technical Support will release a Technical Note detailing this point,<br>
or the <i> GS/OS Reference </i> will be revised to document it.
</p>
<p>
The size of the cache is not an exact number but an exact maximum, and it is that only<br>
when nonzero.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the user has set the cache size to nonzero, that value (which will<br>
always be an increment of 32K) is the maximum cache size. If the user has set the<br>
cache size to zero, GS/OS allocates a 16K cache for system purposes--so that system<br>
components such as file system translators (FSTs) and drivers (both generated and<br>
loaded) can take advantage of the speed increase the cache provides. There is no way to<br>
completely turn off caching under GS/OS. 
</p>
<p>
When the cache is initialized, it is empty and has zero size. As blocks are added to it, it<br>
grows as necessary to accommodate the increased use until the maximum size is<br>
reached. If no one ever asks for blocks to be cached, the cache remains empty and<br>
occupies no memory.
</p>
<p>
<b>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE CACHE IS FULL</b><br>
Having a maximum cache size implies that there can be a problem -- what happens<br>
when nothing else can be written to the cache because there is no room in cache<br>
memory for more information? How does GS/OS behave when there's no room in the<br>
Cache Inn?
</p>
<p>
The operating system, through the cache algorithm, has a few options for&nbsp;&nbsp;handling the<br>
possibility that the cache will be full. The most obvious option is for the algorithm to<br>
shrug its bit-encoded shoulders and say, "Well, the cache is full, so nothing else will<br>
be written to it." Information that comes knocking at the door thereafter is written to<br>
disk only and read from disk each time it's needed.
</p>
<p>
Most caching algorithms, including the one used by GS/OS, are a little bolder. They<br>
attempt to identify which blocks in the cache have actually been used and to keep those<br>
blocks in the cache, simultaneously removing from the cache the blocks that have not<br>
been used. The rationale for this is that if a block hasn't been read from the cache in a<br>
long time, it's probable that no one's going to want to read it again for a while, and the<br>
cache can be better used by a new block. For example, when GS/OS is booted, the file<br>
START.GS.OS is read from the disk. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that this file's<br>
information was placed in the cache. This file isn't likely to be read again by the<br>
operating system or by any application unless GS/OS has to be reloaded, which under<br>
version 5.0 and later never happens. This file could, therefore, be sitting in the cache,<br>
taking up valuable cache space that subsequently can't be used by directory blocks,<br>
bitmap blocks, or even program files that will be needed repeatedly, such as the<br>
Finder or APW commands. The strategy used by most caching algorithms tries to keep<br>
space in the cache free for use by directory blocks, bitmap blocks, and program files<br>
that will be needed repeatedly.
</p>
<p>
One popular caching algorithm keeps all the blocks in a chain with the most-recently<br>
used block at the beginning of the chain and the block not used for the longest time at<br>
the end. When there's no more room in the cache, the blocks at the end of the chain are<br>
removed, making room for new blocks. This algorithm, straightforwardly called a<br>
least-recently used (LRU) caching algorithm, is what GS/OS uses.
</p>
<p>
Some blocks, however, can't be kicked out of the cache by the LRU algorithm. These are<br>
the blocks placed in the cache by a write-deferral session. When such a session is in<br>
progress, some or all of the information written to files is write-deferred, which<br>
means GS/OS keeps the information around in the cache instead of taking the time to<br>
write it all to physical media. This is accomplished in different ways for different file<br>
systems; each file system translator behaves in the way it can achieve the best<br>
performance during a session. For example, the ProDOS FST writes actual data to the<br>
disk but not system-level information such as directories or bitmap blocks.
</p>
<p>
If any write-deferred blocks are in the cache, the Cache Manager will not purge them<br>
to make room for new blocks until they have been written to disk. If the cache fills up<br>
with nonpurgeable blocks and another nonpurgeable block must be added, a feature<br>
known as AutoFlush, which was new to System Software 5.0, takes over, stops the<br>
session, and flushes all write-deferred blocks to disk so that new ones can be added.<br>
This has the effect of breaking a session into lots of mini-sessions, each exactly long<br>
enough to get the best possible use from the cache.
</p>
<p>
Blocks in the cache can also be deleted from it by another method besides the LRU<br>
algorithm. If a driver detects a disk-switched condition, which normally means that an<br>
on-line volume has been taken off-line, it makes the<code> SET_DISKSW</code>.System Service<br>
call, which enables the file system translators to remove all blocks belonging to the<br>
switched disk from the cache so that no blocks are in the cache for volumes that aren't<br>
currently on-line. This ensures that no one accidentally reads from the device and gets<br>
an old block from the cache, or that no blocks are in the cache for volumes that aren't<br>
currently on-line.
</p>
<p>
<b>DIFFERENCES FROM THE MACINTOSH</b><br>
The GS/OS Cache Manager is different from the caching implementation on the<br>
Macintosh in two important ways. The first difference is in the way memory is<br>
allocated. On the Macintosh, if the user sets the disk cache size to 128K, a 128K block<br>
of memory stays allocated for the disk cache unless someone resizes the cache. Under<br>
GS/OS, memory for cached blocks is allocated as needed up to the maximum set by the<br>
user. The other difference between GS/OS and Macintosh is in the size of the blocks<br>
that can be cached. The GS/OS cache can handle a block of any size; if a device deals in<br>
2048-byte blocks--as some CD-ROM discs do--GS/OS will cache a 2048-byte block.<br>
The Macintosh Cache Manager, on the other hand, can only cache 512-byte blocks.
</p>
<p>
<b>HOW APPLICATIONS REQUEST TO USE THE CACHE</b><br>
Applications--or desk accessories, inits, or anyone who makes GS/OS system<br>
calls--request to use the cache through cache-related parameters to the system calls.<br>
Specifically, applications can ask that data read from files be cached by using the<br>
<code>cachePriority </code>field of class one (and only class one)<code>Read </code>and<code> Write </code>calls.
</p>
<p>
<b>CACHING CAN BE REQUESTED BY CLASS ONE CALLS</b><br>
An application requests caching by setting the<code> cachePriority </code>field in the GS/OS<br>
parameter block of<code> Read </code>and<code> Write </code>calls. (These are the only two GS/OS system<br>
calls with this field in the parameter block. The system calls<code> DRead </code>and<code> DWrite </code>do<br>
not have a<code> cachePriority </code>field, as the Device Manager always disables caching of<br>
blocks read or written through these calls.)
</p>
<p>
A value of $0000 for the word-length parameter in the<code> cachePriority </code>field is the<br>
norm (and the default if this parameter is omitted) and indicates that blocks involved<br>
in this call should not be cached. A value of $0001 identifies the blocks involved as<br>
candidates for caching. Only a value of $0001 in this field will cause files read at the<br>
application level to be considered for caching.
</p>
<p>
The fact that a caching request has been made by an application doesn't mean that it<br>
will be fulfilled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications do not call the Cache Manager; other system components<br>
do. Those components (file system translators and drivers) may deny the request when<br>
it doesn't make sense or is dangerous for the file's blocks to be cached. 
</p>
<p>
<b>CACHING CANNOT BE REQUESTED BY CLASS ZERO CALLS</b><br>
Applications written using class zero calls (including older ProDOS 16 applications)<br>
cannot request that their files be placed in the cache. To make such a request, the<br>
application must be changed to use class one calls. At first this seems a little harsh and<br>
arbitrary, but it's quite the opposite. GS/OS could treat class zero file calls one of two<br>
ways--it could automatically cache everything, or automatically cache nothing. If it<br>
cached everything, reading any file larger than the maximum cache size would flush<br>
all the cached blocks, no matter how frequently they were used. This would force them<br>
all to be reread from disk the next time they were needed. Such a method is normally a<br>
grand waste of time, since most files on the Apple IIgs are typically read once. Most<br>
programs still follow the old Apple II method of "read the file, modify it, and write it<br>
back," and writing such files to the cache only serves to slow things down while the<br>
flushed blocks are reread from disk. Better methods for file manipulation exist these<br>
days, but the system was designed for maximum performance using the methods of the<br>
time.
</p>
<p>
An application knows best which files it will be reading from disk often enough to<br>
benefit from caching. Such decisions are often reached after long performance studies<br>
of cached reads vs. purgeable handles in memory. For more pointers on<br>
application-level caching, see GS/OS Technical Note #3, Pointers on Caching.
</p>
<p>
<b>WRITE-DEFERRAL SESSIONS AND THE CACHE</b><br>
Applications can also speed up disk-intensive operations through the use of<br>
write-deferral sessions. An application begins such a session by giving the GS/OS<br>
system call<code> BeginSession</code>. This places all subsequent writes in a mode where some or<br>
all of the blocks written to disk are placed only in the cache and not on the media.
</p>
<p>
Deferred blocks are then written to the media when the<code> EndSession </code>call is made. If<br>
the<code>EndSession </code>call is not made or if it's made before the files being written to are<br>
closed, some of the blocks for the files written may be on the disk while others are in<br>
the cache only. This damages disks in most file systems as fast as fingerprints on the<br>
media. Be sure to <i> always </i> issue<code> EndSession </code>calls on every exit path after a<br>
<code>BeginSession </code>call to prevent blocks written from being only in the cache and not on<br>
the disk. And be sure to close all open files before calling<code> EndSession</code>, since the<br>
operating system can get caught with write-deferred blocks in open files if the session<br>
is ended and the disk is ejected before the files are closed.
</p>
<h2>HOW CACHE REQUESTS ARE FULFILLED</h2>
<p>
GS/OS attempts to make sure that although an application can cache blocks if it so<br>
chooses, by default the most intelligent use possible of the caching capabilities will be<br>
made.&nbsp;&nbsp;It does this by filtering out possibly bogus requests for caching at several<br>
levels. When an application makes a request to use the cache, the request is filtered<br>
through drivers and/or file system translators. These agents of the Cache Manager<br>
evaluate requests to make sure that the most intelligent possible use of the caching<br>
capability is made. If an application's request to use the cache is found to be valid, one<br>
of these system components calls a System Service routine to add blocks to the cache.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE SYSTEM SERVICE CALLS</b><br>
The ultimate caching authority is at the System Service call level. System Service<br>
calls are used by drivers and file system translators to access the routines that act on<br>
cache requests. These calls are available only to drivers and file system translators;<br>
they are not available to applications. System Service calls are accessed through<br>
vectors in the $01/FC00 page and are described in the <i> GS/OS Reference</i> , volume 2,<br>
chapter 12.
</p>
<p>
The following four System Service calls--to add blocks, find blocks in the cache, move<br>
blocks in and out of the cache, and remove all purgeable blocks in the cache belonging<br>
to a switched disk--are the only calls that can be made by drivers. Other<br>
cache-related System Service calls enable the system to delete blocks and volumes<br>
from the cache, but these are not documented in the <i> GS/OS Reference </i> and can only be<br>
used by file system translators and other Apple-supplied system components.
</p>
<p>
<code>CACHE_ADD_BLK </code>($01/FC08) is the System Service call for a routine that adds blocks<br>
to the cache. This call takes several parameters on GS/OS direct page (which is<br>
available to drivers and file system translators but not to applications), including<br>
information to identify the block by volume, device number, size and block number,<br>
and whether or not a write-deferral session is in progress. The Cache Manager is<br>
called, and it adds the block to the cache with no filtering. If necessary, the entire<br>
purgeable cache (the cache size minus all nonpurgeable write-deferred blocks) will<br>
be purged to add the block. The call will return with an error if a block could not be<br>
added to the cache, most likely because the entire purgeable cache was smaller than the<br>
block to be cached.
</p>
<p>
<code>CACHE_FIND_BLK </code>($01/FC04) is the System Service call for a routine that finds<br>
blocks in the cache. It will search the cache for a specified block, returning a pointer<br>
to it if it is found. The cache can be searched by device number, so a device driver can<br>
find all blocks it has cached, or by volume ID, so that a file system translator can find<br>
all blocks it has cached (when a write-deferral session is in progress).
</p>
<p>
<code>MOVE_INFO </code>is the System Service call for a memory-moving routine. This routine is<br>
called by drivers and file system translators to move data in and out of the cache.
</p>
<p>
<code>SET_DISKSW</code> is the System Service call for a routine that kicks out all purgeable<br>
blocks in the cache belonging to a switched disk. If <code>SET_DISKSW</code> is called while a<br>
write-deferral session is in progress involving closed files on that device, GS/OS puts<br>
up a dialog box warning that the disk was prematurely ejected and that the disk's<br>
structure may be damaged.
</p>
<p>
There are two main parts of GS/OS that can use these System Service calls -- drivers<br>
and file system translators.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE ROLE PLAYED BY DRIVERS</b><br>
Drivers filter cache requests passed on from the application and file system translator<br>
levels. With every <code>Driver_Read</code> and <code>Driver_Write</code> command a driver gets from an<br>
application, it is passed instructions to take one of three possible caching actions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If the <code>cachePriority</code> word (on GS/OS direct page) is $0000, the block<br>
being read or written should not be cached.</li>
<li> If <code>cachePriority</code> is nonzero with the high bit clear ($0001--$7FFF),<br>
the block should be cached as a normal, purgeable block.</li>
<li> If <code>cachePriority</code> has the high bit set ($8000-$FFFF), the block should<br>
be cached as a deferred nonpurgeable block. This means a write-deferral<br>
session is in progress. In this case, which is only valid for <code> Driver_Write</code><br>
calls (there are no read-deferral sessions in GS/OS), the driver should write<br>
the requested block only to the cache and not to the physical media. The end of<br>
the session will result in the driver being called again to write all the cached<br>
blocks to the physical media.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are instances, such as identifying volumes, in which a file system translator<br>
might wish to force a read from physical media rather than from the cache (if the<br>
block is in it). In these cases, the FST ID number on GS/OS direct page has the high bit<br>
set, telling drivers not to read the block from the cache.
</p>
<p>
A driver is not obligated to cache blocks when requested to, but instead can decide to<br>
disable caching completely or selectively. In some cases, the driver should refuse to<br>
cache <i> any </i> blocks. For example, this would be appropriate if the driver is for a device<br>
that cannot identify a disk-switched condition with any degree of reliability, as with a<br>
5.25" disk. Since the driver can't call <code> SET_DISKSW</code> until it notices the disk has been<br>
switched--which could be well after the fact--a block in the cache for such a device<br>
might not be deleted when it should be, and thus the driver should refuse to cache any<br>
blocks in the first place. Or for example, if a driver can actually read from the media<br>
faster than a block can be returned from the cache, it should refuse to cache blocks.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE ROLE PLAYED BY FILE SYSTEM TRANSLATORS</b><br>
File system translators can initiate cache requests themselves, and can filter cache<br>
requests passed on from the application level.
</p>
<p>
When a file is opened and read or written, not all of the requests to a driver for<br>
information from the physical media are requests for data blocks from the file in<br>
question. Many of the read and write requests are for directories,<br>
file-system-specific data structures--such as key blocks and index blocks in<br>
ProDOS--and bitmap blocks. File system translators need these data structures<br>
repeatedly during file operations, and may ask that the blocks involved be cached. The<br>
ProDOS FST does this, caching all blocks it reads and writes that aren't passed on to the<br>
application. If the caching can be done, the file system translator gets much faster<br>
response time the next time it needs those blocks. On ProDOS disks, the caching of the<br>
volume directory and volume bitmap give tremendous speed increases since every file<br>
opening causes a read of the volume directory, and every write operation causes a read<br>
and write of the volume bitmap.
</p>
<p>
The file system translator may also cause caching of a different variety. When a<br>
write-deferral session is enabled, the file system translator changes the <br>
<code>cachePriority</code> field it passes to the drivers so that blocks are marked as<br>
write-deferred. This places them in the cache in a nonpurgeable state but not on the<br>
disk. The ProDOS FST asks that all of its ProDOS-specific directory, index, and bitmap<br>
blocks be placed in the cache write-deferred, but that all pure data blocks go straight<br>
out to disk without caching. This enables most devices to write data to contiguous areas<br>
of the disk, so that the head doesn't need to move back and forth writing directories and<br>
index blocks and updating bitmaps. All of that is done in one burst at the end of the<br>
session. Other file system translators may use the cache during sessions in ways that<br>
make sense for that particular file system. For example, the AppleShare FST handles<br>
caching in a completely different way, not involving the GS/OS cache at all, since the<br>
media could change on the server from another workstation. Most file system<br>
translators, however, use the GS/OS cache in ways similar to the way the ProDOS FST<br>
uses it.
</p>
<p>
A file system translator can deny an application's caching request if it interferes with<br>
optimal system performance. For example, caching a ProDOS file being copied to a<br>
ProDOS disk during a session would slow things down, since cached file blocks would be<br>
continually removed from a full cache to make room for more write-deferred system<br>
blocks from the ProDOS FST. Write-deferral sessions are usually used to copy large<br>
numbers of files or create them from memory. In either case, the files in question<br>
aren't likely to be read again, so the ProDOS FST eliminates possible overhead by<br>
denying requests to cache files during write-deferral sessions.
</p>
<p>
<b>RESETTING THE CACHE FROM THE APPLICATION</b><br>
Only one application-level call acts only on the cache--the <code> ResetCache</code> call (class<br>
one only, call number $2026). This call forces the cache to be reinitialized, purging<br>
all blocks that are in it and resizing if necessary. Do not issue this call while a<br>
write-deferral session is in progress; you can use<code>SessionStatus</code> to see if a<br>
write-deferral session is currently active.
</p>
<p>
If you're writing a utility program and suspect that an file system translator has<br>
cached something you don't really want around, calling <code>ResetCache</code> will ensure the<br>
cache is flushed. The cache is also resized from the battery RAM parameter. As<br>
discussed earlier, this parameter is currently $81 and represents the cache size in<br>
32K increments, but this is not guaranteed.<code> ResetCache</code> is called by the RAM CDev to<br>
change the size of the cache.
</p>
<p>
To make the call, simply issue it with a parameter block pointer to a word of $0000.<br>
There are no parameters.
</p>
<p>
<b>WHERE TO GO FROM HERE</b><br>
This article has described the basics of the GS/OS cache, and has given you an idea of<br>
how an application requests caching and how such a request is fulfilled (or not<br>
fulfilled, if the request turns out not to be in the best interests of the system).
</p>
<p>
If you want to experiment with the effects of GS/OS calls that request caching, play<br>
around with these calls in the Exerciser that comes on the GSBug disk. That's why it's<br>
there. It's come a long way from the ProDOS 16 Exerciser. It makes all the calls<br>
(inline or stack-based, any class, with the exception of ResetCache), lists all devices,<br>
and catalogs directories to 255 levels. It also lets you choose any number of<br>
parameters for any class one call, except ResetCache, and allows you to modify<br>
memory through a built-in editor--you can visit the Monitor and return if you so<br>
choose. (Incidentally, the new calls for System Software 5.0 are coming in a revision<br>
soon.)
