Dear Readers,<br>
<p>
I just got back from sabbatical and it was great: I left and could hardly remember that I<br>
had ever worked for Apple, and now that I'm back I can hardly remember that I ever<br>
left.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's good, I think, to be fully where you are as you linger. 
</p>
<p>
Upon my return, I wasn't quite sure how, in my advanced state of equilibrium, I was<br>
going to find a way for drivers and clock parts to live together in a logical editorial. So<br>
I decided to throw logic out the window and to stick with what I know: taking an analogy<br>
and stretching it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here goes.
</p>
<p>
Clock parts are carefully crafted according to well-defined rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with following<br>
the rules, creativity and craftsmanship are brought to bear, so some clocks are more<br>
pleasing, better functioning, and longer lasting than others.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how it is with<br>
drivers, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;Respect for the rules, creativity, and craftsmanship combine to make a<br>
driver tick.
</p>
<p>
Clock parts as a group (or a watch) keep track of the moment-by-moment passage of<br>
time, freeing us to focus our attention on things more riveting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, a<br>
system-level driver lets your application focus on things more interesting (and<br>
useful) than hardware-specific details. 
</p>
<p>
So much for the analogy.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this issue, Matt provides thorough coverage of the printer<br>
driver: what it does, how it does it, and how to write one for the Apple II GS Zz tells<br>
even more about what your application can do with PostScript code to avoid perils<br>
posed by the LaserWriter driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you decide to write your own driver, you can<br>
follow the legions before you and launch into assembly language, or you can follow<br>
Tim's lead and try C++.

On another topic, Scott A. Williams writes:
</p>
<p>
"On page 126, I believe that the<code> AllocHeap </code>method call to<code> InitZone </code>should have<br>
calls to<code>GetZone </code>and<code> SetZone </code>around it, like this:
</p>
<pre>THz savedZone = GetZone ();
InitZone(nil, kNumDfltMasters, limitPtr, zonePtr);
SetZone(savedZone);</pre>
<p>
<i>"Inside Macintosh,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;volume II, page 29, says, '<code>InitZone </code>creates a new heap zone,<br>
initializes its header and trailer, and makes it the current zone.' It's the 'makes it&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br>
current zone' part that's the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the calls to<code> GetZone </code>and<code> SetZone</code>,<br>
any handles or pointers created after a call to the<code> AllocHeap </code>method would be<br>
allocated in the new heap created expressly for holding<code> PtrObjects </code>and not in the<br>
application heap where they belong."
</p>
<p>
Well, when Scott wrote he was right, and now he's sporting a fine new&nbsp;&nbsp;develop shirt. <br>
When you write, you will too.
