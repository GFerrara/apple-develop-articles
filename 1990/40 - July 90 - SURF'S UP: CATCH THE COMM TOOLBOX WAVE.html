<i>The Macintosh Communications Toolbox provides managers and utilities that offer<br>
basic networking and communications services&nbsp;&nbsp;to applications. This article introduces<br>
you to three of the Communications Toolbox managers--the Connection Manager, the<br>
Terminal Manager, and the File Transfer Manager--as well as Surfer, a sample<br>
application that uses the Communications Toolbox to implement simple networking and<br>
communications services.</i>
</p>
<p>
Networking and communications applications running on the Macintosh are like a good<br>
pair of rose-colored shades. They filter out the harshness of antiquated architectures<br>
and conventions, and present users with a familiar, intuitive interface. The Macintosh<br>
Communications Toolbox provides a standard framework in which you can develop<br>
modular, consistent networking and communications applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a developer<br>
using the Communications Toolbox, you can write applications without having to know<br>
the complexities of each networking and communications environment your<br>
applications run in. For example, imagine writing a chess program that enables users<br>
to play opponents over any sort of data connection, without having to code for each type<br>
of connection. The Communications Toolbox makes this possible.
</p>
<h2>COMMUNICATIONS TOOLBOX CONTENTS</h2>
<p>
The Communications Toolbox consists of four managers and a set of utilities that<br>
provide basic networking and communications services. Think of these managers and<br>
utilities as an extension to the Macintosh Toolbox. Each of the managers in the<br>
Communications Toolbox--the Connection Manager, the Terminal Manager, the File<br>
Transfer Manager, and the Communications Resource Manager--handles a different<br>
aspect of networking and communications. The utilities provide routines that perform<br>
a variety of useful auxiliary functions. This article focuses on the Connection Manager,<br>
the Terminal Manager, and the File Transfer Manager. Communications Toolbox<br>
managers work with communications tools, which&nbsp;&nbsp;are self-contained software<br>
modules that provide protocol-specific services. The managers and tools perform the<br>
following functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The Connection Manager and tools are the mechanism for establishing and<br>
maintaining a data connection between machines.</li>
<li> The Terminal Manager and tools show data to users in a manner that<br>
emulates the characteristics of specific terminal types.</li>
<li> The File Transfer Manager and tools handle the protocols for sending and<br>
receiving files.</li>
<li> The Communications Resource Manager helps applications keep track of<br>
necessary resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You code to the application programming interface defined by the managers. In turn,<br>
the managers request specific services from communications tools. The interaction<br>
between the tool and the manager is invisible to your application, so when you design<br>
your application, you don't have to be concerned with what sort&nbsp;&nbsp;of data connection is in<br>
place, what kind of terminal to emulate, or what type of&nbsp;&nbsp;file transfer to perform. It's<br>
similar to the way applications deal with the Printing Manager. Applications say<br>
"Print," and the Printing Manager sends the request&nbsp;&nbsp;to the Printer Driver, which<br>
figures out how to print on a specific device.
</p>
<p>
By providing basic services, communications tools free application developers from<br>
having to learn the most heinous intricacies of communications conventions. That work<br>
is left up to those who practice the black art of writing communications tools.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Communications tools live in the Communications folder, which is in the System<br>
Folder and is created and populated when you install the Communications Toolbox.<br>
(Under System 7.0 they will reside in the Extensions folder.) A number of<br>
communications tools are available from APDA. Others, from Apple and third-party<br>
developers, will be available in the near future. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Figure 1 shows how the Communications Toolbox managers and tools fit between your<br>
application and the operating system. The application interacts with the manager,<br>
which in turn interacts with the tool. The tool, in turn, communicates&nbsp;&nbsp;with the<br>
operating system (or Communications Resource Manager), provides a specific<br>
service, and passes back to the application (through the manager) any relevant<br>
informationp.

<b>Figure 1</b> How the Communications Toolbox Fits In
</p>
<h2>USING THE MANAGERS: AN OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>
In this section we give an overview of how your application uses each manager. The<br>
sample application Surfer, discussed in detail in the next section, provides a model of<br>
how an application uses the Communications Toolbox.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;To get each of the Communications Toolbox managers ready for action, your<br>
application does the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Initializes the manager, by calling<code> InitCM</code>, <code>InitTM</code>, or<code> InitFT</code>.</li>
<li> Gets the<code> procID </code> for a specified tool (this is a tool file reference<br>
number, similar to the ones returned by the File and Resource Managers), by<br>
calling<code> CMGetProcID</code>, <code>TMGetProcID</code>, or<code> FTProcID</code>.</li>
<li> Creates a new instance of the tool, by calling<code> CMNew</code>, <code>TMNew</code>, or<code> FTNew</code>.</li>
<li> Configures the tool. You can present users with a standard tool-settings<br>
dialog box by calling<code> CMChoose</code>, <code>TMChoose</code>, or<code> FTChoose</code>, or you can set the<br>
configuration directly using a configuration string. Figure 2 shows the dialog<br>
box that is put up in response to a call to<code> TMChoose </code>while the VT 102 tool is<br>
active.</li>
</ol>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2</b> The Dialog Box for Choosing and Configuring a Terminal Tool
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Associated with each communications service (connection, terminal, and file<br>
transfer) is a data structure that the manager, tool, and application maintain. For&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br>
Connection Manager, this data structure is called the connection record; for the<br>
Terminal Manager, the terminal record; for the File Transfer Manager, the file<br>
transfer record. These records are discussed in detail in <i> Macintosh Communications</i><br>
<i>Toolbox Reference</i> . Your application refers to these records for information upon<br>
which to base decisions, similarly to how the Window Manager uses information in the<br>
window record.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;An important concept central to the architecture of the Communications Toolbox is<br>
that applications wait on events. When an application (Surfer, for example) gets an<br>
event to pass to one of the communications tools, it tells the manager, which then <br>
passes a message to the appropriate tool, along with a handle to the associated data<br>
structure (that is, connection record, terminal record, or file transfer record). The<br>
communication between the tool and the manager is done through the data structure and<br>
return codes. The section "Handling Events" goes into more detail about this.
</p>
<h2>A LOOK AT SURFER</h2>
<p>
Surfer is a simple terminal emulation package that Alex adapted from the DTS sample<br>
code sent out to developers. It uses the Communications Toolbox to implement simple<br>
networking and communications services. It provides support for data connections,<br>
terminal emulations, and file transfers; and can use new communications tools without<br>
changing one line of code. Keep in mind that you can use the Communications Toolbox to<br>
go well beyond the domain of standard terminal emulation software, to seamlessly<br>
incorporate networking and communications functionality into all kinds of programs.
</p>
<p>
Here we'll show you selected portions of Surfer to illustrate how it uses the<br>
Communications Toolbox. First we'll show you code to help you get a feel for the<br>
structure and flow of the program. Then we'll show how Surfer meets the common<br>
communications challenges of establishing and maintaining a connection, emulating a<br>
terminal, and tranferring files. Finally, we'll discuss how Surfer handles two common<br>
problems. You should examine the source code, which appears in its entirety on<br>
the<i>Developer Essentials</i> disc, to fully understand Surfer. You should also examine the<br>
connection record, terminal record, and file transfer record in Surfer. As mentioned<br>
earlier, these records are fundamental to the operation of each manager.
</p>
<p>
<b>HOW SURFER STARTS UP</b><br>
Here's Surfer's main routine:
</p>
<pre>BEGIN
    UnloadSeg(@_DataInit);  { Note that _DataInit must not be in
                              Main! }
    MaxApplZone;                  { Expand the heap so code segments
load
                              at the top. }
    Initialize;                   { Initialize the program. }
    UnloadSeg(@Initialize); { Note that Initialize must not be in
                              Main! }
    EventLoop;                    { Call the main event loop. }
END.</pre>
<p>
As with surfing, where you've got to get out the wetsuit and put the board on the Bug,<br>
Surfer has some preparation it needs to do before it calls its main event loop. The<br>
following fragment from the<code> Initialize</code>procedure shows how Surfer initializes the<br>
Communications Toolbox:
</p>
<pre>{ Does CommToolbox exist? }
IF NOT TrapAvailable(_CommToolboxTrap, OSTrap) THEN
    AlertUser('ACK!! No CommToolbox',TRUE);

{ Check for System 6.0 or better, 64K ROM. }
ignoreError := SysEnvirons(kSysEnvironsVersion, TerraMac);

WITH TerraMac DO
IF (systemVersion &lt; $0600) OR (machineType &lt; 0) THEN
AlertUser('Need System 6.0 or better',TRUE);


{ Check various memory configs. }
IF ORD(GetApplLimit) - ORD(ApplicZone) &lt; kMinHeap THEN
AlertUser('Out of Memory',TRUE);


PurgeSpace(total, contig);IF total &lt; kMinSpace THEN
AlertUser('Out of Memory',TRUE);


{ Load up the Communications Toolbox. }
{ Must initialize CRM &amp; CTBUtilities first. }
err :=  InitCTBUtilities;
err :=  InitCRM;


err := InitTM;  {Initialize the Terminal Manager.}
IF err = TMNoTools THEN
AlertUser('No terminal tools found',TRUE);


err :=  InitCM; { Initialize the Connection Manager. }
IF err = CMNoTools THEN
AlertUser('No connection tools found',TRUE);


err :=  InitFT; { Initialize the File Transfer Manager. }
IF err = FTNoTools THEN
AlertUser('No file transfer tools found',FALSE);</pre>
<p>
<b>HANDLING EVENTS</b><br>
After dealing with the initialization details, Surfer loops, waiting for events to wave<br>
through, handling them like this:
</p>
<pre>PROCEDURE EventLoop;
VAR
    gotEvent    : BOOLEAN;
    event       : EventRecord;

BEGIN
    REPEAT
          DoIdle;

          IF gHasWaitNextEvent THEN     { Put us 'asleep' forever
                                        under MultiFinder }
                 gotEvent := WaitNextEvent(everyEvent, event, 0, NIL)

          ELSE BEGIN
                 SystemTask; { Must be called if using GetNextEvent. }
                 gotEvent := GetNextEvent(everyEvent, event);
          END;

          IF gotEvent THEN BEGIN
                 AdjustCursor(event.where);    { Make sure we have the
                                               right cursor. }
                 DoEvent(event);
          END;

          AdjustCursor(event.where);
    UNTIL FALSE;            { Loop forever; we quit through an
                          ExitToShell. }
END; { EventLoop }</pre>
<p>
The procedure<code> DoEvent </code>is where much of the code surfing takes place.&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure<br>
is too long to reproduce here, but Figure 3 shows the important points schematically,<br>
and you can read the source code on the CD for more details.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/201.gif" width="584 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3</b> How Surfer Handles Events
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Events received by Surfer come in two main flavors: Surfer-owned&nbsp;&nbsp;and tool-owned. <br>
Tools can create their own windows behind Surfer's&nbsp;&nbsp;back (for instance, file transfer<br>
tools can put up a status window&nbsp;&nbsp;during a transfer), but since Surfer is in control,<br>
events destined for&nbsp;&nbsp;these windows come through Surfer's main event loop.&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily, <br>
when a tool creates its own window, it stuffs a handle to itself in the&nbsp;&nbsp;window's<code> refCon</code><br>
field.&nbsp;&nbsp;All Surfer has to do to determine who owns a&nbsp;&nbsp;window is compare the window's<br>
<code>refCon </code>to the existing tool handles.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a match is found, Surfer calls the appropriate<br>
routine (<code> TMEvent</code>,<code> CMEvent</code>, or<code> FTEvent</code>) so that the tool can handle the event. <br>
Otherwise, Surfer handles the event itself.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Even Surfer's window, though, has "guests." The terminal tool needs&nbsp;&nbsp;to receive mouse<br>
clicks and update events, and all the tools need to&nbsp;&nbsp;receive activate/deactivate and<br>
suspend/resume events.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are&nbsp;&nbsp;passed to the tool with the appropriate routine:<br>
<code>TMClick</code>,<code> TMUpdate</code>,<code> CMActivate</code>, and so on.
</p>
<p>
<b>MANAGING IDLE TIME</b><br>
The idle procedure is a little convoluted because so much is happening. Surfer has to<br>
read and send data someplace, blink cursors, and provide all the sessions time for<br>
background file transfers. It's something like the action at O'Hare Airport.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Because communications tools can display their own windows, Surfer must walk the<br>
window list to give each tool time in a session. Although idle time is provided to tools<br>
with<code> CMIdle</code>,<code> FTExec</code>, and<code> TMIdle</code>, Surfer doesn't want to send data to the terminal<br>
tool if there's a file transfer in progress and the tools are using the same channel.<br>
Another thing worth checking is the file transfer status. Did the transfer start? Has it<br>
just ended? Was it successful? Did an auto- receive sequence come across? These<br>
concerns are discussed in greater detail later in this article in the section "Doing a<br>
File Transfer."
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Surfer also needs to get data to the terminal tool. Surfer checks to see if the connection<br>
is open or data is available, and if so tells the tool to read it and stream it to the<br>
terminal:
</p>
<pre>{ Get the state of the connection. }
theErr := CMStatus(gConn, sizes, status);

IF (theErr = noErr) THEN  BEGIN
    { Route the data if we have any. }
    IF (BAND(status, cmStatusOpen + cmStatusDataAvail) &lt;&gt;  0) AND
                 (sizes[cmDataIn] &lt;&gt;  0) THEN BEGIN

          { Tell the tool to get the data. }
          theErr := CMRead(gConn, gBuffer, sizes[cmDataIn],
                            cmData, FALSE,NIL,0,flags);

          { Send data to the terminal. }
          IF (theErr = noErr) THEN
                 bytesEaten := TMStream(gTerm,gBuffer,
                            sizes[cmDataIn],flags);

          { Could check bytesEaten vs. sizes[cmDataIn]. }
    END; { Sizes &lt;&gt;  0. }
END; { Good status. }</pre>
<p>
Now that you've seen something of Surfer's main event loop, we'll look at how Surfer<br>
uses the Communications Toolbox managers.
</p>
<p>
<b>INITIATING A CONNECTION</b><br>
For two computers to talk to each other, they must establish and maintain a data<br>
connection. Applications that provide terminal emulation or file transfer services use<br>
the data connection to physically transfer the data. Before an application can open a<br>
data connection, the Connection Manager has to be properly set up. Surfer does this<br>
during initialization by calling<code> InitCM </code>to initialize the Connection Manager; calling<br>
<code>CMGetProcID </code>to get its<code> ProcID</code>; and calling<code> CMNew </code>to create a new instance of a<br>
connection tool. Note that Surfer does not explicitly configure the tool:<br>
<code>CMNew</code>automatically configures the tool to its default settings. The user can<br>
reconfigure the tool by choosing the appropriate menu item.
</p>
<p>
Here's how Surfer calls<code> CMNew</code>:
</p>
<pre>sizes[cmDataIn] := kBufferSize;
sizes[cmDataOut] := kBufferSize;
sizes[cmCntlIn] := 0;
sizes[cmCntlOut] := 0;
sizes[cmAttnIn] := 0;
sizes[cmAttnOut] := 0;

{ refCon and UserData are 0. }
gConn := CMNew(procID, cmData, sizes, 0, 0);
IF gConn = NIL THEN
    AlertUser('Can''t create a connection tool',TRUE);</pre>
<p>
Surfer supports only the data channel and asks for a 1K buffer for both input and<br>
output.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the connection tool may be unable to handle the requested buffer size,<br>
Surfer needs to look at the<code> bufSizes</code>field in the connection record and use that value<br>
to allocate space for the buffer.
</p>
<pre>gBuffer := NewPtr(gConn^^.bufSizes[cmDataIn]);
IF MemError &lt;&gt; noErr THEN
    AlertUser('Out of memory',TRUE);</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;Before Surfer initiates a connection, it checks the state of the connection with<br>
<code>CMStatus</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the connection is not already open or in the process of opening, Surfer<br>
issues a<code> CMOpen </code>call, in this case synchronously with a 0 time-out.&nbsp;&nbsp;A timeout of 0<br>
says, "Make a single attempt to open the connection."
</p>
<pre>{ Get connection info. }
theErr := CMStatus(gConn, sizes, status);
IF (theErr = noErr) THEN BEGIN
    { If it isn't already open, then open it. }
    IF BAND(status, cmStatusOpen + cmStatusOpening) = 0 THEN
          theErr := CMOpen(gConn, FALSE, NIL, 0);
END;</pre>
<p>
<b>ONCE THE CONNECTION IS OPEN . . .</b><br>
Using the Connection Manager to maintain a data connection is a lot like talking with a<br>
friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;You start off by saying hello (<code> CMOpen</code>,<code> CMAccept</code>, or <code>CMListen</code>), ask how<br>
he's doing (<code> CMStatus</code>), engage in small talk (<code>CMRead</code> and <code> CMWrite</code>), take a deep<br>
breath once in a while (<code>CMIdle</code>), and end by saying goodbye (<code> CMClose</code>).
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Surfer uses <code>CMStatus</code> a lot to return information like whether there is data waiting<br>
to be read, and whether the connection is open or closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;If<code> CMStatus </code>shows that data<br>
is available, Surfer reads it and passes the data to the terminal tool or the file transfer<br>
tool, whichever is appropriate.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Closing a connection is similar to opening one, except, of course, the logic is reversed:<br>
Surfer only closes the connection if it's open. When Surfer is done with the session, it<br>
disposes of the tool with<code> CMDispose</code> and gets rid of the buffer with <code> DisposPtr</code>.
</p>
<p>
<b>STARTING A TERMINAL EMULATION SESSION</b><br>
In Surfer, a session is a connection, terminal, and file transfer tool,&nbsp;&nbsp;along with a data<br>
buffer tied to an owning window. Surfer is limited&nbsp;&nbsp;to one window and one session. To<br>
create a new session, Surfer calls
</p>
<pre>{ Get window. }
window := GetNewWindow(rWindow, NIL, WindowPtr(-1));
SetPort(window);</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;The first thing to notice right after the<code> GetNewWindow </code>call is the<code> SetPort</code>. The<br>
terminal tool does as little port manipulation as possible&nbsp;&nbsp;and assumes that the port<br>
where it's drawing is the correct one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surfer sets the port so it can direct drawing to<br>
either a window&nbsp;&nbsp;graphics port or a printer graphics port. Be warned that the terminal<br>
tool may die ungracefully if the current port is not valid.
</p>
<p>
During initialization, Surfer gets the Terminal Manager ready for action by calling<br>
<code>InitTM</code>,<code> TMGetProcID</code>, and<code> TMNew</code>. Surfer creates a new instance of a terminal tool as<br>
follows:theRect := window^.portRect;
</p>
<pre>{ Flags set to 0; no cacheProc, breakProc, or clikLoop;  }
{ refCon and UserData are 0. }
gTerm := TMNew(theRect,theRect,0,procID,window,
          @TermSendProc,NIL,NIL,NIL,@ToolGetConnEnvirons,0,0);
IF gTerm = NIL THEN
    AlertUser('Can''t create a terminal tool',TRUE);</pre>
<p>
In<code> TMNew</code>, Surfer specifies the bounds of the drawing area, the terminal tool to use,<br>
the owning window, two internal procedures, and some application data.
</p>
<p>
When Surfer is done with the session, it disposes of the tools with<code>TMDispose</code>.
</p>
<p>
<b>ONCE THE TERMINAL SESSION HAS STARTED . . .</b><br>
The Terminal Manager handles the interaction between the host and the user during a<br>
session. Through the Terminal Manager, terminal tools can display both words and<br>
images to the user in a manner that emulates the characteristics of specific terminal<br>
types. The Terminal Manager also accepts information from the user (such as<br>
keystrokes), which is sent back to the host.
</p>
<p>
Many Terminal Manager routines are similar to TextEdit routines. Since the Terminal<br>
Manager is in charge of interacting with the user, most of the calls to the Terminal<br>
Manager that Surfer uses are event- oriented--even events like streaming data, when<br>
data becomes available, and passing data between Surfer and the tool.
</p>
<p>
The calls<code> TMIdle</code>,<code> TMStream</code>, and<code> TMKey </code>enable Surfer to provide basic terminal<br>
emulation services. Surfer calls<code> TMIdle </code>during its idle loop so, among other things,<br>
the tool can blink its cursor (similar to the way<code> TEIdle </code>works). When data becomes<br>
available from the connection tool, Surfer calls<code> TMStream </code>to stream the data to the<br>
terminal tool for drawing to the window. When a key event occurs, Surfer calls<br>
<code>TMKey</code>. The terminal tool processes the keystroke and then uses a Surfer procedure,<br>
specified in<code> TMNew</code>, to send data back to the connection. Since Surfer is in charge of<br>
this procedure, it can do some data filtering, use synchronous or asynchronous write<br>
calls, or just drop the request on the floor if it wants to.
</p>
<p>
Your application will probably support multiple sessions, making it difficult to find<br>
the connection handle associated with a particular terminal record. To help your<br>
application out, the terminal tool's<code>refCon </code>is passed along in the parameter list to <br>
<code>TMNew</code>. Your application can put the connection tool handle in this location for this<br>
purpose. Then, in<code> TermSendProc </code>(a procedure that terminal tools expect your<br>
application to provide), your application can get the connection handle back by casting<br>
the<code> refCon </code>to a<code> ConnHandle</code>. Of course, this is only one possibility; you can store<br>
whatever you want in the<code> refCon</code>.
</p>
<p>
<b>DOING A FILE TRANSFER</b><br>
The File Transfer Manager provides file transfer services for a transfer between <br>
Surfer and another computer process. The other process can be running on the same<br>
computer as Surfer or on any other type of computer. Surfer makes a request of the<br>
File Transfer Manager in&nbsp;&nbsp;order to transfer a file or perform some other file transfer<br>
related function. The File Transfer Manager then sends this request to one of the tools<br>
it manages. The tool provides the service according to the specifics of&nbsp;&nbsp;its file transfer<br>
protocol. Once the tool has finished, it passes back to Surfer any relevant parameters<br>
and return codes. It's very similar to the way the other Communications Toolbox<br>
managers work.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;During initialization, Surfer gets the File Transfer Manager ready for action by<br>
calling<code> InitFT</code>,<code> FTGetProcID</code>, and<code> FTNew</code>. Surfer uses the following code to create a<br>
new instance of a file transfer tool:
</p>
<pre>{ Flags set to 0, no read/write proc (let the tool use its own), }
{ refCon and UserData are 0.  }
gFT := FTNew(procID,0,@FTsendProc,@FTreceiveProc,NIL,NIL,
          @ToolGetConnEnvirons,window,0,0);
IF gFT = NIL THEN
    AlertUser('Can''t create a file transfer tool',TRUE);</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;For<code> FTNew</code>, Surfer specifies a send-and-receive procedure for the file transfer tool<br>
to use, if it doesn't already have one. Some file transfer tools, like ftp, handle their<br>
own connection and therefore don't use these procedures.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;To start a file transfer, either sending or receiving, Surfer calls<code>FTStart</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep<br>
the transfer going, Surfer calls<code>FTExec</code>in its idle loop. That's it. When the transfer has<br>
completed, the tool takes care of closing itself. If Surfer needs to stop during the<br>
transfer, it can call<code>FTAbort</code>, and the tool automatically cleans up its mess. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Surfer needs to handle three things during a file transfer. First, it needs to look out<br>
for an auto-receive string, a sequence of characters supported by some file transfer<br>
protocols that throws Surfer into receive mode (MacTerminal 1.1 does this). If the<br>
file transfer tool supports auto-receive strings, Surfer uses the Connection Manager<br>
routine<code> CMAddSearch </code>to tell the connection tool to look out for the auto-receive<br>
string. Incidentally, when the connection tool is looking for an auto-receive string and<br>
the user chooses a new connection tool or modifies the current one, the Connection<br>
Manager destroys the old search for this string. Surfer, therefore, needs to add the<br>
search again.
</p>
<p>
Second, Surfer needs to handle data routing. Most file transfer tools use the current<br>
connection to get data. However, if a file transfer is in progress, we don't want Surfer<br>
trying to send data to the terminal tool. Some file transfer tools establish their own<br>
connection separate from the one Surfer has established, so any data read from the<br>
connection should go to the terminal tool as usual.
</p>
<p>
Third, Surfer needs to check that the file transfer was copacetic. Here's how it does<br>
this. During a file transfer, the File Transfer Manager turns on a bit in the file<br>
transfer record called<code> ftIsFTMode</code>. By keeping track of this bit, Surfer can tell when<br>
a file transfer has completed. It can then check the<code> FTSucc </code>bit in the file transfer<br>
record to see if the file transfer went according to plan.
</p>
<p>
Two of the procedures file transfer tools use are<code>FTSendProc</code>and <code>FTReceiveProc</code>,<br>
which respectively send and receive data.&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>FTSendProc</code> and<code> FTReceiveProc</code> are<br>
similar to <code>TermSendProc</code>, except the file transfer tool can specify which connection<br>
channel Surfer should use to read or write the data.
</p>
<p>
When Surfer is done with the session, it disposes of the tools with <code>FTDispose</code>.
</p>
<p>
<b>HOW SURFER WORKS WITH AUTO-RECEIVE STRINGS</b><br>
Whenever a new file transfer tool is created, either through an<code>FTNew </code>or<code> FTChoose</code>,<br>
Surfer searches the file transfer record for an auto-receive string. If&nbsp;&nbsp;there is one,<br>
Surfer calls<code> CMAddSearch </code>to tell the Connection Manager to look for the string in the<br>
incoming data.
</p>
<pre>IF (gFT &lt;&gt; NIL) AND (gConn &lt;&gt; NIL) THEN BEGIN
    tempStr := gFT^^.AutoRec; { Do I need to add a search? }
    IF (tempStr &lt;&gt; '') THEN BEGIN
          gFTSearchRefNum := CMAddSearch(gConn,tempStr,
                  cmSearchSevenBit, @AutoRecCallback);
          IF gFTSearchRefNum = -1 THEN BEGIN
                 AlertUser('Couldn''t add stream search',FALSE);
                 gFTSearchRefNum := 0;
          END;
    END; { Can autoreceive. }
END; { Good FT and conn. }</pre>
<p>
Surfer passes a<code> procPtr </code>to<code> CMAddSearch </code>so that when the search completes, the<br>
connection tool calls Surfer's<code> AutoRecCallback</code>. If more than one search was going on<br>
simultaneously, Surfer also gets back a<code> refNum </code>to help identify the returning search.
</p>
<p>
When the file transfer tool calls<code> AutoRecCallback</code>, Surfer starts to receive a&nbsp;&nbsp;file.<br>
Unfortunately, Surfer can't call<code> FTStart </code>from the callback procedure, because that<br>
procedure may be called at interrupt time, and<code> FTStart </code>cannot be called at interrupt<br>
time because it may move memory. So Surfer does the next best
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;thing. It sets a global flag in<code> AutoRecCallback </code>that says it received the auto-receive<br>
string. During the idle loop, it then looks at the flag to see if it's time to start the file<br>
transfer.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Here's how Surfer start to receive a file transfer.
</p>
<pre>IF gFT &lt;&gt; NIL THEN BEGIN
    { Let the FT tool use its own default file info. }
    theReply.vRefNum := 0;
    theReply.fName := '';
    theReply.good := TRUE;

    gStartFT := FALSE; { Shut the flag down. }

    { We remove the search temporarily in case it comes }
    { across during the transfer. Will be re-added in the }
    { idle loop once the transfer is completed. }

    IF gConn &lt;&gt; NIL THEN
          IF (gFT^^.autoRec &lt;&gt; '') AND
                 (gFTSearchRefNum &lt;&gt; 0) THEN BEGIN
                 CMRemoveSearch(gConn, gFTSearchRefNum);
                 gFTSearchRefNum := 0; { We found it already. }
          END;

    { Start receiving the file. }
    { The rest gets transferred in the Idle loop. }

    anyErr := FTStart(gFT,ftReceiving,theReply);

    IF (anyErr &lt;&gt; noErr) THEN
          ; { File Transfer tool will alert user on an error. }
END; { Good handle. }</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;One other thing to think about is the string itself. If the string randomly came across<br>
again during the file transfer, Surfer doesn't want to start the transfer again because<br>
it's already in progress. Therefore, when starting the transfer, Surfer removes the<br>
search for the string, transfers the file, and adds the search back in the idle loop when<br>
finished.
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;HOW SURFER HANDLES TWO COMMON PROBLEMS</b><br>
Two useful routines--<code>IsAppWindow </code>and<code> FindToolID</code>--help Surfer&nbsp;&nbsp;determine the<br>
owner of a window and the<code> procID </code>for a given tool.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;As discussed earlier, a tool-owned window has a handle to the owning tool in its<br>
<code>refCon.</code> In <code>IsAppWindow</code>, Surfer makes sure the window is an application window by<br>
checking the<code> refCons </code>against all the tool handles.
</p>
<pre>IF window = NIL THEN
    IsAppWindow := FALSE

ELSE BEGIN
    theRefCon := GetWRefCon(window);
    WITH WindowPeek(window)^ DO
          IsAppWindow := ((windowKind &gt; = userKind) |
                 (windowKind = dialogKind)) &amp;
                 (gTerm &lt;&gt; TermHandle(theRefCon)) &amp;
                 (gConn &lt;&gt; ConnHandle(theRefCon)) &amp;
                 (gFT &lt;&gt; FTHandle(theRefCon));
END;</pre>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, all three managers--the Terminal, Connection, and File<br>
Transfer Managers--require a<code> procID </code>when specifying a new instance of a tool. To go<br>
from a name of a terminal tool, for instance, to a<code> procID</code>, Surfer calls<br>
<code>TMGetProcID(theName)</code> first. (You can also do this with Connection Manager and File<br>
Transfer Manager routines.) Because the<code> procID </code>is dynamic, Surfer works with the<br>
name of the tool, rather than this value.
</p>
<pre>IF (toolClass = ClassTM) THEN BEGIN
    { If it can't get the default, get the first. }
    toolName := kDefaultTermTool; {VT102 Tool}
    procID := TMGetProcID(toolName);

    IF (procID = -1) THEN BEGIN
          anyErr := CRMGetIndToolName(toolClass,1,toolName);
          IF (anyErr = noErr) THEN
                 procID := TMGetProcID(toolName);
    END;
END { ClassTM. }</pre>
<h2>THE END OR JUST THE BEGINNING?</h2>
<p>
It should be clear by now that the Communications Toolbox makes writing full-blown<br>
communications applications and adding networking and communications services to<br>
existing applications easier than it used to be. By coding to the Communications<br>
Toolbox application programming interface, you can focus on providing networking and<br>
communications services rather than worrying about support for various industry<br>
standards. Seamless and easy access to information all over the world is<br>
revolutionizing how we communicate and think about each other. The Macintosh<br>
Communications Toolbox helps application developers and users become part of this<br>
revolution.

<b>ROB BERKOWITZ'S</b> career has come a long way, despite getting off to a dubious start<br>
(he worked for the large blue corporation). His B.S. in English (emphasis on the BS,<br>
he says) from Carnegie Mellon put him on the path to his Great American Reference<br>
Manual, the <i>Macintosh Toolbox Reference.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes working at Apple because "the<br>
offices are right next to some pretty primo cycling trails" and he has "the freedom to<br>
thrash around in the dirt in the middle of the day all year round." He is a Grateful Dead<br>
enthusiast who feels that "most Deadheads are genuinely good people. It would be nice if<br>
more people were like that." Truck on, Rob.

<b>KAZ</b> doesn't know his official title, but thinks he may be a Communications Toolbox<br>
Engineer. We try to be understanding of these lapses; he's got his hands full keeping<br>
track of and remembering the names of his hundreds of colorful family members<br>
worldwide. He, himself, is an international sort; he was born in Trinidad and has lived<br>
in Toronto and Texas. He's been at Apple since 1988, after getting his degree in<br>
mechanical engineering from Rice University. He tries to stay as busy as possible,<br>
especially with sailing, skiing, gliding, cooking, dancing, and writing fiction. He likes<br>
his food extremely(!) spicy, so we suggest caution if he invites you to lunch. His goal<br>
in life is not to get convicted, and he studies karate. Again, we suggest caution if he<br>
invites you to lunch.&nbsp;&nbsp;*
