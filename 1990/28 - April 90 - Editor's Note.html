<p>
Dear Readers,
</p>
<p>
Wow!&nbsp;&nbsp;Your response to the first issue of&nbsp;&nbsp;develop was overwhelming!&nbsp;&nbsp;You sent almost<br>
two hundred letters and Links telling me what you liked, what you'd like changed, and<br>
what articles you'd like to see.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've published (and answered) a representative<br>
sampling in the Letters section and will continue to let you know what happens with<br>
your suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article-specific questions are answered (by the original authors)<br>
in the Macintosh Q &amp; A section.
</p>
<p>
This issue of <i>develop</i> revolves around object programming.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you've been reading<br>
much of what's been coming out of Apple lately, you will have noticed quite a push<br>
toward object programming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple has invested years of R &amp; D in object<br>
programming and we're working to get you to take advantage of the work we've done. 
</p>
<p>
Unless you're already an object-based programmer, this issue probably won't solve<br>
any problems you're struggling with right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm hoping, however, that it helps to<br>
convince you that object programming can save you time and effort in the long run and<br>
that it's worth the investment it will take to learn about a new environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only<br>
will object programming help you to write and to maintain today's applications, but it<br>
will also help to prepare you for tomorrow's system software.
</p>
<p>
Providing you with code and ideas that serve you well when new products come out is<br>
one of my top priorities, so look past today and into tomorrow and use the code and<br>
ideas we give you.
</p>
<p>
Keep those cards and letters coming!
</p>
<p>
