<h2>POLYMORPHIC CODE RESOURCES IN C++</h2>

<h1>PATRICK C. BEARD</h1>
<p>
<i>The C++ programming language supports data abstraction and object programming.</i><br>
<i>Until now, using C++ to its full capacity in stand-alone code has not been possible.</i><br>
<i>This article demonstrates how you can take advantage of two important features of</i><br>
<i>C++, inheritance and polymorphism, in stand-alone code. An example shows how to</i><br>
<i>write a window definition function using polymorphism.</i>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In object programming, polymorphism gives programmers a way to solve problems by<br>
beginning with the general and proceeding to the specific. This process is similar to<br>
top-down programming, in which the programmer writes the skeleton of a program to<br>
establish the overall structure and then fills in the details later. Polymorphism<br>
differs from top-down programming, however, in that it produces designs that are<br>
reusable outside the context of the original structure. The attractiveness of reusable<br>
code is one of the reasons object programming is catching on. 
</p>
<p>
The shape hierarchy shown in Figure 1 is one of the most frequently cited examples of<br>
polymorphism.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/132.gif" width="404 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1</b>Shape Hierarchy
</p>
<p>
The most general concept is the shape; all objects in the hierarchy inherit attributes<br>
from the shape. Area, perimeter, centroid, and color are attributes common to all<br>
shapes. Notice that the hierarchy proceeds from the general to the specific:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Polygons are shapes with a discrete number of sides.</li>
<li> Rectangles are polygons that have four sides and all right angles; squares<br>
are rectangles having all equal sides.</li>
<li> Ellipses are shapes that have a certain mathematical description; circles<br>
are ellipses&nbsp;&nbsp;whose widths equal their heights.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In C++, concepts are represented as classes. The more abstract the concept, the higher<br>
in the inheritance hierarchy the concept resides. Two key C++ features support<br>
polymorphism: inheritance and virtual member functions. We can use these to develop<br>
more concretely specified shapes and ask questions of any shape about its area,<br>
perimeter, or centroid.
</p>
<p>
The virtual functions provide a protocol for working with shapes. Here is an example<br>
of the shape hierarchy as it could be represented in C++:
</p>
<pre>class Shape {
public:
    virtual float area();       // Area of the shape.
    virtual float perimeter();  // Its perimeter.
    virtual Point centroid();   // Its centroid.
};

class Ellipse : public Shape {
public:
    virtual float area();       // Area of the shape.
    virtual float perimeter();  // Its perimeter.
    virtual Point centroid();   // Its centroid.
private:
    Point center;           // Center of ellipse.
    float height;           // How high.
    float width;            // How wide.
};

class Circle : public Ellipse {
public:
    virtual float area();       // Area of the shape.
    virtual float perimeter();  // Its perimeter.
    virtual Point centroid();   // Its centroid.
};</pre>
<p>
In this implementation, a circle is an ellipse with the additional constraint that its<br>
width and height must be equal.
</p>
<p>
Once an object of a type derived from<code> Shape </code>has been instantiated, it can be<br>
manipulated with general code that knows only about shapes. The benefit is that, having<br>
written and debugged this general code, you can add more kinds of shapes without<br>
having to alter the general code. This eliminates many potential errors.
</p>
<h2>IMPLEMENTATION IN MPW C++</h2>
<p>
MPW C++ is a language translator that translates C++ to C. Programs are compiled by<br>
first being translated to C, after which the MPW C compiler takes over and compiles<br>
the C to object code.
</p>
<h2>IMPLEMENTATION OF VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>
As noted, polymorphism is accomplished by using inheritance and virtual member<br>
functions. How does the C++ compiler decide which function should be called when an<br>
instance of unknown type is used? In the current release of MPW C++, every instance<br>
of an object in an inheritance hierarchy has a hidden data member, which is a pointer<br>
to a virtual function table. Each member function is known to be at a particular offset<br>
in the table. The member functions for the different classes in an inheritance chain are<br>
stored in different tables. The table pointed to is determined at the time of object<br>
creation. (See the sidebar called "Layout of Objects and Their Virtual Functions in<br>
Memory.")So far, nothing in the implementation of virtual functions seems to<br>
preclude their use in nonapplication contexts. Once an object is instantiated, the code<br>
needed to call a virtual function can be executed from any context, including<br>
stand-alone code resources. However, MPW C++ does not currently support a<br>
mechanism to allocate storage for, or to initialize, the virtual function tables in<br>
nonapplication contexts.
</p>
<h2>CODE RESOURCE SUPPORT FOR POLYMORPHISM</h2>
<p>
As noted above, virtual function tables are required for polymorphism in C++. To<br>
support virtual function tables in stand-alone code, two issues must be resolved:
</p>
<ul>
<li> How to allocate the virtual function tables.</li>
<li> How to initialize the virtual function tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>GLOBAL VARIABLES IN CODE RESOURCES</b><br>
In MPW C++, virtual function tables live in C global variable space.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately,<br>
the MPW languages do not support the use of global variables in stand-alone code.<br>
However, Technical Note #256, Stand- Alone Code,<i>ad nauseam</i> , shows how to add<br>
support for global variables in standalone code resources. In simple terms, this<br>
involves allocating storage for the globals, initializing the globals, and arranging for<br>
the proper value to be placed in machine register A5. These functions can be neatly<br>
expressed as a class in C++. The following class, called<code> A5World</code>, provides these<br>
services. 
</p>
<pre>class A5World {
public:
    A5World();      // Constructor sets up world.
    ~A5World();     // Destructor destroys it.

    // Main functions:  Enter(), Leave().
    void Enter();   // Go into our world.
    void Leave();   // Restore old A5 context.

    // Error reporting.
    OSErr Error()   { return error; }

private:
    OSErr error;    // The last error that occurred.
    long worldSize; // How big our globals are.
    Ptr ourA5;      // The storage for the globals.
    Ptr oldA5;      // Old A5.
};</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;To use globals, a code resource written in C++ merely creates an instance of an<br>
<code>A5World </code>object. Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>// Hello_A5World.cp
// Simple code resource that uses global variables.

#include "A5World.h"

// Array of characters in a global.
char global_string[256];


void main()
{
    // Temporarily create global space.
    A5World ourWorld;

    // Check for errors.
    if(ourWorld.Error() != noErr)
        return;

    // We got it; let's go inside our global space.
    ourWorld.Enter();

    // Use our global variable.
    strcpy(global_string, "Hi there!");
    debugstr(global_string);

    // Time to go home now.
    ourWorld.Leave();

    // The destructor automatically deallocates
    // our global space.
}</pre>
<p>
The full implementation of class<code> A5World </code>appears on the <i>Developer Essentials </i> disc<br>
(Poly. in Code Resources folder). By itself, this is a useful piece of code.
</p>
<p>
<b>INITIALIZING THE VIRTUAL FUNCTION TABLES</b><br>
As noted, MPW C++ is implemented as a language translator (called CFront) that<br>
translates C++ to C. As you might guess, classes are implemented as structs in C, and<br>
member functions are just ordinary C functions. As also noted, the virtual function<br>
tables are implemented as global variables. We have solved the problem of having<br>
globals in stand-alone code, so the remaining issue is how to initialize these tables<br>
with the proper pointers to the member functions.
</p>
<p>
The initialization of a global variable with a pointer to a function is not supported in<br>
stand-alone code written in MPW languages. This initialization is normally done by the<br>
linker, which creates a jump table, and the current version of the MPW Linker will<br>
not generate jump tables for stand- alone code. Therefore, the only way to initialize<br>
global variables with pointers to code is manually at run time.
</p>
<p>
To understand the solution to this problem, let's take a look at what CFront does when<br>
it sees a hierarchy of classes with virtual functions. Here is a simple hierarchy of two<br>
classes, <code> Base </code>and<code>Derived</code>:
</p>
<pre>class Base {
public:
    Base();
    virtual void Method();
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived();
    virtual void Method();
};</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When MPW C++ sees these class definitions, it emits the following C to allocate and<br>
initialize the virtual function tables:
</p>
<pre>struct __mptr __vtbl__7Derived[]={0,0,0,
0,0,(__vptp)Method__7DerivedFv,0,0,0};
struct __mptr *__ptbl__7Derived=__vtbl__7Derived;
struct __mptr __vtbl__4Base[]={0,0,0,
0,0,(__vptp)Method__4BaseFv,0,0,0};
struct __mptr *__ptbl__4Base=__vtbl__4Base;</pre>
<p>
The variables __<code>vtbl</code>__<code>4Base[] </code>and __<code>vtbl</code>__<code>7Derived[] </code>are the virtual function<br>
tables for the classes <b><code>Base</code></b> and <b><code>Derived</code></b>. To support polymorphism in stand-alone<br>
code, this code must be split into two parts: a declaration part and an initialization<br>
part. The initialization part is simply a C function that initializes the tables. The<br>
following code shows how the tables might be transformed for use in stand-alone code:
</p>
<pre>struct __mptr __vtbl__7Derived[3];
struct __mptr *__ptbl__7Derived;
struct __mptr __vtbl__4Base[3];
struct __mptr *__ptbl__4Base;

void init_vtbls(void)
{
    __vtbl__7Derived[1].d = 0;
    __vtbl__7Derived[1].i = 0;
    __vtbl__7Derived[1].f = (__vptp)Method__7DerivedFv;
    __ptbl__7Derived=__vtbl__7Derived;
   
    __vtbl__4Base[1].d = 0;
    __vtbl__4Base[1].i = 0;
    __vtbl__4Base[1].f = (__vptp)Method__4BaseFv;
    __ptbl__4Base=__vtbl__4Base;
}</pre>
<p>
What we end up with is a declaration of global variables and a simple C function that<br>
must be called before the virtual functions are called. The code transformation shown<br>
is easy to implement. The<i>Developer Essentials </i> disc contains a simple MPW Shell<br>
script and two MPW tools that perform this function. The script is called<br>
<code>ProcessVTables</code>, and the tools are called<code> FixTables </code>and<code>FilterTables</code>.
</p>
<p>
<b>COMBINING THE CONCEPTS</b><br>
What remains is to combine the concepts of allocating global variables and initializing<br>
virtual function tables into a single construct. The following code, class<br>
<code>VirtualWorld</code>, based on class<code>A5World</code>, provides these two services.
</p>
<pre>class VirtualWorld : public Relocatable {
public:
    // Constructor sets up world.
    VirtualWorld(Boolean worldFloats);
    // Destructor destroys it.
    ~VirtualWorld();
   
    // Main functions; Enter sets A5 to point to
    // our world.
   
    // Go into our world.
    void Enter();
    // Restore old A5 context.
    void Leave();
   
    // Error reporting.
    OSErr Result()  { return error; }

private:
    // The last error that occurred.
    OSErr error;
    // Whether we have to call the vtable init.
    Boolean codeFloats;
    // How big our globals are.
    long worldSize;                    

    // The storage for the virtual world.
    Ptr ourA5;                         
    // Old A5.
    Ptr oldA5;                         
};</pre>
<p>
The constructor for class<code> VirtualWorld </code>requires one parameter,<code> worldFloats</code>, a<br>
Boolean value that tells whether or not the code resource floats between calls. This flag<br>
is used to decide whether or not the virtual function tables need reinitializing on every<br>
call to the code resource. Code resources such as <code>WDEF</code>s do float, and can even be<br>
purged, so this flag is essential. If<code> worldFloats</code>is false, the virtual function tables<br>
are initialized once in the constructor. This initialization is performed by calling the<br>
function<code> init_vtables()</code>, shown earlier.
</p>
<p>
The<code> Enter() </code>and<code> Leave() </code>member functions set up and restore the A5 global space,<br>
respectively. If the member variable<code> codeFloats </code>is true, <code>Enter() </code>calls<br>
the<code>init_vtables() </code>each time.
</p>
<p>
As in the<code> A5World </code>class, the<code> Error() </code>member function reports error conditions,<br>
which should be checked before assuming the world is set up correctly.
</p>
<h2>EXAMPLE: AN ICONIFIABLE WINDOW DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
To show off this really cool technique, I have written one of everybody's favorite code<br>
resources, a window definition function, or<code> WDEF</code>, that uses polymorphism. The<br>
example demonstrates how to define a base class for windows that is easy to inherit<br>
from--so you can add a feature to a window while leaving the original window code<br>
untouched.
</p>
<p>
<b>CLASS WINDOWDEFINITION</b><br>
Class<code> WindowDefinition </code>forms the template for all other window definitions. Here<br>
is its interface:
</p>
<pre>class WindowDefinition : public Relocatable {
public:
    // Initialize window.
    virtual void New(WindowPeek theWindow)
        { itsWindow = theWindow; }
    // Destroy window.
    virtual void Dispose() {}                              
    // Compute all relevant regions.
    virtual void CalcRgns() {}
    // Draw the frame of the window.
    virtual void DrawFrame() {}
    // Draw the goaway box (toggle state).
    virtual void DrawGoAwayBox() {}
    // Draw window's grow icon.
    virtual void DrawGIcon() {}
    // Draw grow image of window.
    virtual void DrawGrowImage(Rect&amp; growRect) {}
    // Do hit testing.
    virtual long Hit(Point&amp; whereHit)
        { return wNoHit; }
protected:
    // Window we are keeping track of.
    WindowPeek itsWindow;
};</pre>
<p>
<code>WindowDefinition </code>uses methods to respond to all the messages to which a<code> WDEF </code>is<br>
expected to respond. All the methods are just placeholders here, as<br>
<code>WindowDefinition </code>is an <i>abstract</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;base class.
</p>
<p>
Class<code> WindowDefinition</code>'s superclass, <code>Relocatable</code>, provides services to all<br>
handle-based classes, such as locking<code> this</code>, moving it high, and unlocking it. This<br>
class makes the casts to type<code>Handle </code>that are normally necessary and makes dealing<br>
with handle-based classes pleasant--and safer.
</p>
<p>
<b>CLASS WINDOWFRAME</b><br>
The next class to look at is<code>WindowFrame</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>WindowFrame</code>implements a basic window that<br>
can be resized, moved, and shown in highlighted or unhighlighted state. 
</p>
<pre>class WindowFrame : public WindowDefinition {
public:
    virtual void New(WindowPeek theWindow);
    virtual void Dispose();
    virtual void CalcRgns();
    virtual void DrawFrame();
    virtual void DrawGrowImage(Rect&amp; growRect);
    virtual long Hit(Point&amp; whereHit);

private:
    // Border between content and structure
    // boundaries.
    RgnHandle itsBorderRgn;
};</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The code that makes this window work is included in the full source example on the <br>
<i>Developer Essentials </i> disc.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/133.gif" width="521 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3 </b>Class WindowFrame's Window on the Desktop
</p>
<p>
<b>CLASS ICONWDEF</b><br>
To implement a window that is iconifiable, we can derive from the class <code>WindowFrame</code>,<br>
and modify its behavior, without having to rewrite the code that implements the<br>
window. All an icon has to do is respond to clicks and be dragged around. So, the class<br>
<code>IconWDef </code>just has to worry about keeping track of whether the window is iconified or<br>
not, and lets the<code> WindowFrame </code>part take care of being a window. Here is the interface<br>
to class<code> IconWDef</code>.
</p>
<pre>class IconWindowDef : public WindowFrame {
public:
    // Window methods.
    virtual void New(WindowPeek theWindow);
    // We have different regions when iconified.
    virtual void CalcRgns();
    // We draw an icon if in the iconified state.
    virtual void DrawFrame();
    virtual long Hit(Point&amp; whereHit);
private:
    // State of our window.
    Boolean iconified;
    // If we've ever been iconified.
    Boolean everIconified;
    // Flag that says we want to change our state.
    Boolean requestingStateChange;
    // How many times CalcRgns has been called.
    short calcRgnsCount;
    // Place to hit to iconify window.
    Rect iconifyRect;  
    // Where to put when iconified.
    Point iconifiedLocation;
};</pre>
<p>
The decision about when to iconify the window is made in the<code>IconWDef</code>'s<code> Hit()</code>method.<br>
In the current implementation, if the window's zoom box is hit with the Option key<br>
held down, the window toggles between being an icon and being a window. 
</p>
<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>
This article has shown how to use polymorphism--the combination of inheritance and<br>
run-time binding of functions to objects--in the context of stand-alone code<br>
resources. Issues that had to be resolved were how to provide support for globals in<br>
stand-alone code and how to arrange for the initialization of virtual function tables.
</p>
<p>
Although the code for the example shows how to use polymorphism for window<br>
definition functions, you can use the same technique to write any type of code resource:<br>
menu definitions, list definitions, control definitions, and even drivers.
</p>
<p>
<b>ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT</b><br>
The code could be improved in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li> By using handles to allocate the A5 globals and passing in a parameter to<br>
tell<code> VirtualWorld </code>that the data can float.</li>
<li> By removing the QuickDraw-specific code and placing it in a subclass of<br>
<code>VirtualWorld</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>CAVEATS</b><br>
A couple of words of warning are in order. The tools that process the virtual function<br>
tables depend&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the way CFront generates the tables. If AT&amp;T or Apple ever decides<br>
to change the way these&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tables are generated (probably unlikely), the tools<br>
described in the example will probably break.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it would not be difficult to<br>
modify the tools if changes were made.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Classes inherited from class<code> PascalObject </code>are not supported by the techniques<br>
described in this article. This is because these classes do not implement run-time<br>
binding using virtual function tables. This is not a problem since<code> PascalObject</code>s<br>
were intended only for use with MacApp, and (for now) MacApp can be used only for<br>
applications.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Look at the code on<i> Developer Essentials </i> for more information, and good luck!
</p>
<h2>&nbsp;LAYOUT OF OBJECTS AND THEIR VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS IN<br>
MEMORY</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;For a typical class such as class<code> foo</code>, how does the compiler generate code to call the<br>
proper virtual function at run time? The following class and diagram show how this is<br>
accomplished.
</p>
<pre>class foo {
public:
    virtual void method1 ();
    virtual void method2 ();
private:
    int member1;
    int member2;
};</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;As shown by the figure, an instance of class<code> foo </code>has three data members.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the<br>
members,<code> member1</code> and<code> member2</code>, are part of the class definition,&nbsp;&nbsp;while a third<br>
member we'll call<code> pVTable </code>is a hidden member automatically created by the<br>
compiler.<code> pVTable </code>is a pointer to a table of function pointers (also automatically<br>
generated by the compiler) that holds pointers to all the functions in the class that are<br>
declared virtual. The code that is generated to call a virtual function is therefore<br>
something like this:
</p>
<pre>// Code written in C++:
myFoo-&gt;method1();
/* Becomes this code in C: */
(*myFoo-&gt;pVTable[0])();</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;This is the memory layout for a virtual function table used in single inheritance. For<br>
multiple inheritance, the structures used are more complicated.
</p>

<b>Figure 2</b> Calling Virtual Functions at Run Time
</p>
<h2>HANDLE-BASED CLASSES</h2>
<p>
The C++ default storage strategy is to create objects as pointers. As we all know, using<br>
pointers to allocate storage on the Macintosh makes memory management a lot less<br>
efficient. The ability to store data in relocatable blocks allows the Macintosh to use<br>
more of its memory since relocatable blocks can be shuffled around to make space.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, Apple has extended C++ in a way that allows us to take advantage of the<br>
Macintosh Memory Manager by adding the built-in class<b><code>HandleObject. </code></b>The only<br>
restrictions placed on handle-based objects is that they can be used only for<br>
single-inheritance hierarchies. Most object programming tasks, however, can be<br>
handled using single inheritance.&nbsp;&nbsp;To make handle-based objects easier to work with,<br>
here is class<b><code> Relocatable</code></b>, a class derived from<b><code>HandleObject</code></b>. Class<br>
<b><code>Relocatable </code></b>provides functions for manipulating handle-based objects without the<br>
hassle of all those casts.
</p>
<pre>class Relocatable : HandleObject {
protected:
    void Lock()             {HLock((Handle)this);}
    void Unlock()           {HUnlock((Handle)this);}
    void MoveHigh()         {MoveHHi((Handle)this);}
    SignedByte GetState()   {return HGetState((Handle)this);}
    void SetState(SignedByte flags)
        {HSetState((Handle)this, flags);}
};</pre>
