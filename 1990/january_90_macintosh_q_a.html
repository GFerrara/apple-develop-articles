<h2>MACINTOSH Q&amp;A</h2>
<h1>MACINTOSH DEVELOPER TECHNICAL SUPPORT</h1>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>I'm drawing into a large offscreen bitmap (PixMap), but anything drawn outside the</i><br>
<i>640 by 480 pixel screen area doesn't get written to the PixMap. Why not?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>When you create a new port with OpenPort or OpenCPort the visRgn is initialized to<br>
the rectangular region defined by screenBits.bounds (IM I:163). If your port has a<br>
large portRect, any drawing will be clipped to the visRgn and you will lose any<br>
drawing outside of the screenBits.bounds rectangle.
</p>
<p>
To correct this set the visRgn of the port to coincide with your port's portRect after<br>
creating the port.
</p>
<p>
Also note that OpenPort initializes the clipRgn to a wide-open rectangular region<br>
(-32768, -32768, 32767, 32767). Some operations (i.e.OpenPicture) can fail<br>
with this setup, so you should try setting clipRgn to a smaller rectangle.clipRgn to a<br>
wide-open rectangular region (-32768, -32768, 32767, 32767). Some operations<br>
(i.e.OpenPicture) can fail with this setup, so you should try setting clipRgn to a<br>
smaller rectangle.

<b>Q </b><i>What is Printing Manager error -8133?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Printing Manager error -8133 occurs when the PostScript interpreter of the<br>
LaserWriter (or any other PostScript printer) generates a PostScript error. 
</p>
<p>
A description of the PostScript command that caused the error will be displayed in the<br>
status window. This error often occurs when an application is sending PostScript<br>
directly to the printer, and that PostScript contains an error. To debug this kind a<br>
problem, you should look at the PostScript generated by the driver. To do this, hold<br>
down the Command-F key right after clicking okay in the Print dialog. A file named<br>
PostScript0 will be created in the current directory.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>I'm confused about the changes to FPRead in AFP version 2.0. How do I use the</i><br>
<i>NewLine mask?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The difference between AFP 1.1 and AFP 2.0 as far as the NewLine Mask is concerned<br>
is that, in AFP 1.1 the only legal values of Newline Mask are $00 and $FF, whereas in<br>
AFP 2.0, all values of Newline Mask are allowed. The Newline Mask is logically ANDed<br>
with a copy of each byte read. If the result matches the Newline char, the read<br>
terminates. The Newline character is returned as the last byte of data that was read<br>
from the fork.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>How do I implement file range locking?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>HFS doesn't provide for file-range locking. AppleShare has additional structures to<br>
implement locking, but there is no way for you to implement locking with HFS. We are<br>
working on this limitation.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>Why does enabling fractional font widths with FractEnable(TRUE) disable Font</i><br>
<i>Substitution?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>When you call FractEnable(TRUE), you are telling the Printing Manager that you<br>
always want to use the fractional width information in the FOND resource of a font.<br>
This fractional information is specified for a 1 point font, and can be scaled for any<br>
desired size. When you tell the Printing Manager to use this width information, the<br>
normal font width information (stored in the ROM of the LaserWriter) is ignored. Font<br>
Substitution provides the ability to substitute high quality PostScript fonts for fonts<br>
that have no PostScript equivalent. For example, a document laid out in Geneva will be<br>
printed with Helvetica if Font Substitution is enabled. When this substitution occurs,<br>
the Printing Manager makes adjustments to the intercharacter spacing of the line to<br>
make the printed Helvetica version match the width of the Geneva version displayed on<br>
the screen. When you enable fractional font widths for a document that uses Geneva,<br>
the Printing Manager is being told to print Helvetica characters on the printer using<br>
fractional widths from the Geneva screen font. If the Printing Manager placed the<br>
Helvetica characters using the fractional widths, formatting problems could occur. For<br>
example, some of the Helvetica characters may be wider than their Geneva equivalents,<br>
causing character collisions. To avoid this problem, the LaserWriter driver disables<br>
the Font Substitution option when fractional fonts ar enabled. This way, WYSIWYG is<br>
maintained. If you want to use fractional fonts, then you should format your document<br>
using fonts that have PostScript versions available on the LaserWriter.

<b>Q </b><i>Inside Mac says that there is a 3K limit on CopyBits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this still true?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The CopyBits limit is obsolete; there is no longer a 3K limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The limit depends on<br>
the amount of RAM in your system.&nbsp;&nbsp;CopyBits tries to use the stack to do all of the<br>
copying.&nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases CopyBits is able to copy entire screen shots at one time. You<br>
might run into problems if you don't have enough stack to hold two times the rowBytes<br>
of your source, but even in this case CopyBits will attempt to find the memory it<br>
needs.

<b>Q </b><i>How do I order an MCP card and software?&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I get when I order it?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>You can order the Macintosh Coprocessor Platform (MCP) card and software through<br>
Apple Software Licensing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The card comes with the MCP platform and software which<br>
contains the appropriate libraries and header files.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the card is the 68000, ROM<br>
(256K), RAM (512K), and the NuBus Logic to drive the card in both master and slave<br>
modes.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also blank space on the board, left there for your communications<br>
hardware.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic documentation is also included.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>Can I get a list of all board IDs?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>No-that information is confidential.&nbsp;&nbsp;MacDTS registers board ID and functional<br>
sResource equates so developers don't use equates that are already in use, but they<br>
can't distribute the list because the&nbsp;&nbsp;database contains information on unreleased<br>
products.
</p>
<p>
However, even if the list could be distributed, any program that depended on the<br>
information in it would be obsolete as soon as a new board came out.
</p>
<p>
It is recommended you use the Slot Manager's ability to find certain cards or functions.<br>
That way, you only need to write your code once, and it will work with newer boards.<br>
That's why QuickDraw can find video cards years after it was frozen in ROM. It does so<br>
by calling the Slot Manager and looking for boards that perform the QuickDraw<br>
compatible video function.

<b>Q </b><i>How do you catch a penguin?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Before we answer that question, perhaps a little biology is in order.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penguins, by<br>
necessity, must be both water and air tight, or they would freeze their little bergies<br>
off in the Antarctic seas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that's a problem if you happen to be warm blooded,<br>
because there's really no way to sweat (since penguins don't have hands, they were<br>
never able to invent Gor-tex&#174;).&nbsp;&nbsp;To handle this problem, they have capillaries in<br>
their feet that swell when warm and act as a radiator.
</p>
<p>
So, to catch a penguin, all you have to do is chase it across the ice. The running will<br>
heat the penguin, which in turn, will heat the penguin's feet. Once the penguin gets hot<br>
enough, he will stick to the ice (what scientists call "the tongue to the sled effect"). All<br>
you have to do then is walk over and pick them up.
</p>
<p>
PLEASE NOTE: When picking a penguin up we can't overemphasize how critical it is to<br>
use slightly warm water to thaw the feet first. Penguin podiatrists are expensive, and<br>
very hard to find.

<b>Q </b><i>I'd like to write James Brown in jail. Where do I write to?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>You can write the Godfather of Soul at:<br>
James Brown, prisoner ID #155413<br>
Broad Rivers Correctional Institute<br>
4460 Broad Rivers Road<br>
Columbia, SC&nbsp;&nbsp;29210
</p>
<p>
Brown is serving concurrent six year and six year &amp; 3 month terms for a wild, <br>
two-state car chase which happened September 24, 1988. He won't be eligible for<br>
parole until 1992.
