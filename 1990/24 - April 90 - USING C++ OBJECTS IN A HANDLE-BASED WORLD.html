<h2>USING C++ OBJECTS IN A HANDLE-BASED WORLD</h2>
<img src="img/151.gif" width="203 px"></img><br>
<h1>ANDY SHEBANOW</h1>
<p>
<i>Although C++ is a powerful and flexible language, its image of the world inside your<br>
computer was shaped by operating systems that were a bit more "traditional" than the<br>
Macintosh's. As a result, C++ routines that work fine for MPW tools can cause severe<br>
problems when used in a Macintosh application. But there are ways around these<br>
problems. This article describes a technique that allows you to use normal C++<br>
objects in your Macintosh applications without undue discomfort. </i>
</p>
<p>
Using C++ objects in the handle-based world of the Macintosh Memory Manager can<br>
get pretty tricky at times. The Apple extension to C++ that solves the memory<br>
allocation problems you're bound to run into can create other headaches for you if you<br>
need to use one or more of several important C++ features in your program. In this<br>
article, you'll learn about the memory allocation problems you can expect to encounter<br>
when you create objects in C++. You'll also learn how to get around these problems<br>
while still retaining the use of important C++ features, by creating a&nbsp;&nbsp;special class<br>
<code>PtrObject</code>. You'll see a sample program that uses <code>PtrObject</code>, and you'll learn how to<br>
implement the class.
</p>
<h2>PROBLEMS WITH MEMORY ALLOCATION FOR OBJECTS IN C++</h2>
<p>
In C++, objects are created dynamically with the <code>new</code> operator, and disposed of with<br>
the <code>delete</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;operator when you've finished with them, like this:
</p>
<pre>TMyObject* aMyObjectRef;
aMyObjectRef = new TMyObject;       // Create a TMyObject object.
aMyObject-&gt;AReallyCoolRoutine(); // Do something useful...
delete aMyObject;                   // Delete the object.</pre>
<p>
When you use these operators, C++ transforms them into calls to <code>operatornew</code> and<br>
<code>operator delete</code>. The default versions of <code>operatornew</code>and <code>operatordelete</code>provided<br>
in the C++ library use the C Standard Library routines <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>,<br>
respectively, to allocate and deallocate the memory needed to store the object.<br>
(Actually, the <code>calloc</code> routine is called to allocate the memory,&nbsp;&nbsp;but <code>calloc</code>just turns<br>
around and calls <code>malloc</code> to do the real work.)
</p>
<p>
These routines work fine for MPW tools, but they can cause the following severe<br>
problems when used in a Macintosh application:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Heap fragmentation.</i>  Nonrelocatable memory for your objects can be<br>
allocated in the middle of your heap, preventing the Mac's Memory Manager<br>
from compacting memory properly.</li>
<li><i>Heap space permanently wasted. </i> Because calloc and free manage their own<br>
list of free memory blocks and never return unused space to the Mac's<br>
Memory Manager, if you create a lot of C++ objects your program can run out<br>
of memory and crash even though you have plenty of free memory available.<br>
(See the sidebar "Everything You Didn't Want to Know About <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>"<br>
for more information on malloc internals.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Fortunately, you can override the default versions of <code>operatornew</code>and<br>
<code>operatordelete</code> in your own classes to get explicit control over memory allocation.<br>
To help you do this, Apple extended C++ to include a predefined base class called<br>
<code>HandleObject</code>. If classes you define inherit from <code>HandleObject</code>, the Mac's<br>
<code>NewHandle</code> and <code>DisposHandlet</code>raps are called instead of the default <code>operator new</code><br>
and <code>operator delete</code> routines.
</p>
<p>
While this solves the memory problems just mentioned, it also precludes the use of<br>
several important C++ features. Here is a partial list of the restrictions that apply<br>
when classes&nbsp;&nbsp;you define inherit from<code>HandleObject</code>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It is an error to declare global variables, local variables, arrays,<br>
members, or param- eters of handle-based classes (rather than pointers to<br>
them).</li>
<li>Multiple inheritance cannot be used with handle-based classes.</li>
<li>Handle-based objects can be created only by the <code>new</code> operator. The only<br>
use of a dereferenced handle-based class pointer (for example, <code>*x</code>) is to refer<br>
to a field in the class (for example, <code>*x.y</code> or <code>x</code>-&gt;<code>y</code>).</li>
<li>It is not possible to allocate an array of handle-based objects--for<br>
example, <code>new-&gt;MyObjects[10]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
As you can see, there are quite a few useful things you can't do in C++ if you use<br>
<code>HandleObject</code>. Most programs should be able to live with these restrictions, but if<br>
your program needs to use multiple inheritance or arrays of objects, a different<br>
solution is called for.
</p>
<h2>EVERYTHING YOU DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT MALLOC AND
FREE</h2>
<p>
Why do the <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> routines wreak so much havoc in a Macintosh<br>
application? The main reason is that these routines were originally written for UNIX<br>
systems, which have no built-in memory allocation facilities. So these library<br>
routines ended up doing everything themselves, including free list management.
</p>
<p>
This isn't all bad, since these routines are simpler and faster than their Macintosh<br>
Memory Manager equiva- lents, but they can cause the severe problems listed earlier<br>
in this article for a Macintosh application. The worst part is that these problems can<br>
occur even if your application doesn't call<code>malloc</code> directly. In many situ- ations, C++<br>
calls<code>malloc</code> for you, as do many of the other routines in the standard library.
</p>
<p>
Here's how it all works (in MPW, at least):
</p>
<p>
When you request some memory from<code>malloc</code>, it rounds the size up to the nearest<br>
power of 2 (8-byte mini- mum, ID checked at the door). If you ask for more than<br>
2048 bytes, <code>malloc</code> just calls <code>NewPtr</code> to allocate the memory, and <code>DisposPtr</code> to get<br>
rid of it. Otherwise,<code>malloc</code> checks its internal free list looking for blocks of the<br>
specified size. If it doesn't find any blocks of that size, it allocates a chunk of memory<br>
with <code>NewPtr</code> big enough to hold 2K worth of blocks (plus 2 bytes overhead per block),<br>
and adds the new blocks to the free list for that size. It then returns you the first block<br>
off of the free list.
</p>
<p>
When you dispose of memory with the <code>free</code> routine, it looks at the block header to<br>
determine which free list to put the block in, and inserts it into the list (sorted by<br>
block address to allow for more intelligent freestore management in the future).<br>
Here's what a small free list looks like:
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/152.gif" width="507 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
MPW (and other Mac development systems) provides versions of these routines to<br>
make life easier for people who are porting code from UNIX systems (or MS-DOS,<br>
OS/2, etc.). However, since the <code>malloc</code>routine calls <code>NewPtr</code> rather indiscrimately, it<br>
can cause blocks to be allocated in very inconvenient places inside your heap, and once<br>
these blocks have been allocated, they are never disposed of.
</p>
<p>
In just one possible scenario, the user opens a large document with your program<br>
SuperOOPWrite and cre- ates 1000 standard C++ objects (each allocated by <code>malloc</code>)<br>
to represent the elements of the document, each about 100 bytes long.&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>malloc</code> asks<br>
<code>NewPtr</code> to create 63 blocks of memory (about 2K each), and you have about 100K less<br>
free memory than you used to. Now the user closes the document, and you dutifully<br>
dispose of all of your objects. Guess what? You still have 100K less memory available<br>
to you as far as the Mac's Memory Manager is concerned, your heap is chock full of 2K<br>
nonrelocatable blocks, and you don't have any way to preflight memory for the next<br>
time the user wants to open a document.
</p>
<p>
By the way, if this algorithm sounds familiar to you, it's because the MPW code is<br>
based on a public domain version of <code>malloc</code> written by Chris Kingsley.
</p>
<h2>THE SOLUTION: CREATING A SPECIAL CLASS PTROBJECT</h2>
<p>
The solution to memory allocation problems when you can't use <code>HandleObject</code> is to<br>
create a special class <code>PtrObject</code> analogous to the <code>HandleObject</code> class. This class<br>
overrides both <code>operatornewand operatordelete</code>, so that real Memory Manager<br>
pointers are used instead of the pointers returned by the default <code>operatornew</code>. <br>
<code>PtrObject</code>also supports the allocation of objects into a separate heap, which further<br>
reduces memory fragmentation.
</p>
<p>
The method functions of the class <code>PtrObject</code> are as follows:
</p>
<p><table border="0"><tr><td><code>AllocHeap</td><td></code>This function creates a separate heap. All descendants of class</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><code>PtrObject</code> cre- ated after calling this function will use this</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>heap. If you do not call this function in your program, the</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>default (application) heap will be used.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>DisposeHeap</td><td></code> This function disposes of the heap allocated by a previous call</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>to <code>AllocHeap</code>. You should call this function before quitting</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>your application. Any <code>PtrObject</code>s created inside the heap</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>will be invalid, so make sure that you aren't using any of</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>those objects anymore (neither <code>operatordelete</code> nor the</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>destructor for these objects will be called).</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>FreeMemory</td><td></code> This function returns the amount of free space in the</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><code>PtrObject</code> heap, as returned by the trap <code>FreeMem</code>. If no </td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>separate heap exists, this function will return the amount of</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>free memory in the default (application) heap.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>MaxMemory</td><td></code> This function returns the size of the largest free block in </td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>the <code>PtrObject</code> heap, as returned by the trap <code>MaxMem</code>. If no</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>separate heap exists, this function will return the amount of</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>free memory in the default (application) heap.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>operator new</td><td></code>This function is called by the C++ compiler to allocate</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>memory for <code>PtrObject</code>s. You never need to call it directly.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>operator delete</td><td></code>This function is called by the C++ compiler to deallocate</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>memory used by<code> PtrObject</code>s. You never need to call it</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>directly. </td></tr></table></p>
<p>
Here is the class declaration for <code>PtrObject</code>, which would normally be found in the<br>
header file PtrObject.h.
</p>
<pre>class PtrObject {
public:
    static OSErr    AllocHeap(size_t heapSize);
    // Create a heap heapSize bytes long to allocate
    // objects in.
   
    static void DisposeHeap();
    // Free up the heap allocated by a previous call
    // to AllocHeap.

    static long FreeMemory();
    // Return the total amount of free space in the heap.

    static Size MaxMemory();
    // Return the size of the largest free block in the heap.
   
    void*       operator new(size_t size);
    void        operator delete(void* p);
    // These are our special allocation and
    // deallocation operators.

private:
    static THz  fZone; 
    // Our private zone pointer.
};</pre>
<p>
Notice that the <code>AllocHeap</code>, <code>DisposeHeap</code>, <code>FreeMemory</code>, and <code>MaxMemory</code>calls are all<br>
<i>static member functions, </i> and that the <code>fZone</code> variable is a <i>static data member</i> . In<br>
C++, static members are shared across all instances of a class. You should use static<br>
members in place of global variables and functions whenever possible, since they have<br>
limited scope (which means fewer name conflicts) and they are logically tied to the<br>
class in which they are declared (which means more readable source code). To call a<br>
static member function, the syntax is
</p>
<pre>ClassName::StaticFunctionName(/* parameters, if any */);</pre>
<h2>A SAMPLE PROGRAM USING PTROBJECT</h2>
<p>
Now that you've seen the interface to the <code>PtrObject</code> class, here is a small sample<br>
application that uses it. This program isn't very useful-- all it does is define a<br>
subclass of <code>PtrObject</code>, create an instance of that object, and call one of its methods.
</p>
<p>
The first thing we have to do is the standard setup for a Macintosh application, which<br>
in this case means including all of the needed header files for the Macintosh Toolbox<br>
and the C Standard Library:
</p>
<pre>// TestPtrObject.cp
#include &lt;Types.h&gt;
#include &lt;QuickDraw.h&gt;
#include &lt;Fonts.h&gt;
#include &lt;SegLoad.h&gt;
#include &lt;Events.h&gt;
#include &lt;Windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;Menus.h&gt;
#include &lt;TextEdit.h&gt;
#include &lt;Dialogs.h&gt;
#include &lt;Memory.h&gt;
#include &lt;OSUtils.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;</pre>
<p>
Next we include the header file for the <code>PtrObject</code> class (just shown), and define a <br>
new class <code>TLout</code> that is derived from it:
</p>
<pre>#include "PtrObject.h"

// A small class that contains some data and a constructor,
// but spends all of its time on street corners cadging
// cigarettes instead of doing useful work.

class TLout : public PtrObject {
public:
    TLout() { DoCadge(); }; // Our constructor.
    virtual void    DoCadge();  // A rude member function.
private:
    char        fArray[256];
};

void TLout::DoCadge()
{
    strcpy(fArray,"Hey buddy, spare a cig?");
}</pre>
<p>
That's all it takes to define a class with the correct memory management behavior.<br>
Here is the main&nbsp;&nbsp;program, which uses our newly defined <code>TLout</code> class:
</p>
<pre>void InitToolbox();     // Forward declaration.

main()
{
    // We need this much space to store the objects
    // we're going to initialize - in this case, 16KBytes.
    const size_t kDefaultHeapSize = 0x4000;
   
    InitToolbox();  // Initialize Mac Toolbox (ho hum).
   
    // Create a heap for PtrObjects to live in.
    OSErr heapErr = PtrObject::AllocHeap(kDefaultHeapSize);
   
    // If we got an error, quit - this isn't a real
    // application, so we don't need error handling, right?
    if (heapErr != noErr)
       ExitToShell();  

    // Create an object - will go in separate heap automatically.
    TLout* aLout = new TLout;   // Do that voodoo that TLouts do&#8230;
    if (aLout != nil)
     {
        aLout-&gt;DoCadge();
        delete aLout;      
              // Delete our object now that we have finished with it.
     }

    // Dispose of the heap.
    PtrObject::DisposeHeap();
    ExitToShell();
}</pre>
<p>
One important thing needs to be pointed out here: you need to<br>
call<code>PtrObject::AllocHeap</code> as early in&nbsp;&nbsp;your program as possible, or the newly<br>
created heap may fragment your application heap. Finally, just for completeness,<br>
here's the implementation of the <code>InitToolbox</code> routine, which makes sure that all of<br>
the necessary pieces of the Mac Toolbox are initialized:
</p>
<pre>voidInitToolbox()
{
    //StandardMacintoshinitialization.
    InitGraf((Ptr)&amp;qd.thePort);
    InitFonts(); InitWindows();
    InitMenus();
    TEInit();
    InitDialogs(nil);
    InitCursor();
    MaxApplZone();
}</pre>
<h2>THE SAMPLE PROGRAM'S MAKEFILE</h2>
<pre># TestPtrObject.make
# by Andrew Shebanow (with some help from the CreateMake script)

OBJECTS = &#8706;
    PtrObject.cp.o &#8706;
    TestPtrObject.cp.o

    -o TestPtrObject

PtrObject.cp.o &#402; PtrObject.cp PtrObject.h
TestPtrObject.cp.o &#402; TestPtrObject.cp PtrObject.h</pre>
<h2>IMPLEMENTING PTROBJECT</h2>
<p>
Now that we've seen how to use class <code>PtrObject</code>, we need to implement it. We must<br>
first include all the necessary header files and allocate our static member data:
</p>
<pre>// PtrObject.cp
#include &lt;Memory.h&gt;
#include &lt;Errors.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;
#include "PtrObject.h"

// Static data members actually need to be declared outside of the
// class definition in order to have space allocated.
THz PtrObject::fZone = nil;</pre>
<p>
Next we have the <code>AllocHeap</code>function.
</p>
<pre>OSErr PtrObject::AllocHeap(size_t heapSize)
{
    // By default, the heap gets kNumDfltMasters master pointers.
    // A small number, but it shouldn't matter, since we will only
    // be allocating Ptrs in this heap and Ptrs don't use master
    // pointers.
    const short kNumDfltMasters = 16;

    // This magic number from Inside Mac, vol. II, chapter 1, is
    // the amount of space required for the zone header and trailer,
    // and the master pointer block. We add this to the requested
    // heap size to compensate.
    const size_t kZoneOverhead =
        64 + 8 + (sizeof(long) * kNumDfltMasters);

    heapSize += kZoneOverhead;      // Factor in overhead.

    // Allocate space for the zone.
    Ptr zonePtr = NewPtr(heapSize);
    if (!zonePtr)           // if alloc fails, return error
        return MemError();  // Get a pointer to the end of the heap.

    Ptr limitPtr = (Ptr) (((ptrdiff_t) zonePtr) + heapSize);
   
    // Initialize the zone.
    InitZone(nil, kNumDfltMasters, limitPtr, zonePtr);

    // Save the zone pointer in our static class variable.
    fZone = (THz) zonePtr;
    return noErr;
}</pre>
<p>
The <code>DisposeHeap</code> member function is much simpler. It just checks to see if we<br>
allocated a zone in the past, and if so, it disposes of the heap's memory. This will<br>
destroy any objects that were allocated inside the heap, which could be dangerous, so<br>
be careful when you call this routine.
</p>
<pre>void PtrObject::DisposeHeap()
{
    // If zone actually exists, dispose of it.
    if (fZone)
     {
        DisposPtr((Ptr) fZone);
        fZone = nil;
     }
}</pre>
<p>
Next we have the <code>FreeMemory and MaxMemory</code>functions. We'll show them together,<br>
since they are almost identical. The only thing of note here is the way we switch in our<br>
special heap if it exists.
</p>
<pre>long PtrObject::FreeMemory()
{
    THz savedZone;
                    // Before we can return the amount of free
                    // memory, we need to switch to the correct zone.
    if (fZone)
     {
        savedZone = GetZone();      // Save current zone.
        SetZone(fZone);         // Make our zone current.
     }

    long free = FreeMem();      // Get total free space.

    if (fZone)
      SetZone(savedZone);       // Restore previous zone.
    return free;
}

Size PtrObject::MaxMemory()
{
    THz savedZone;
                    // Before we can return the maximum block size,
                    // we need to switch to the correct zone.
    if (fZone)
     {
        savedZone = GetZone();      // Save current zone.
        SetZone(fZone);         // Make our zone current.
     }

    Size tSize;             // We know the heap can't grow,
                            // but we have to have a temp
                        // variable to satisfy the Toolbox.
    Size max = MaxMem(&amp;tSize);      // Get size of biggest block.
    if (fZone)
      SetZone(savedZone);       // Restore previous zone.
    return max;
}</pre>
<p>
Now we get to the heart of the class, the <code>operator new</code> function. Like the <code>FreeMemory</code><br>
call, <code>operator new</code>switches to our private heap before it actually allocates memory,<br>
and restores the previous heap when it is done.&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual memory allocation is done<br>
by a call to everyone's favorite Macintosh trap, <code>NewPtr</code>.
</p>
<pre>void* PtrObject::operator new(size_t size)
{
    THz savedZone;

    // before we can allocate memory, we need to switch to the
    // correct zone
    if (fZone)
     {
        savedZone = GetZone();  // Save current zone.
        SetZone(fZone);         // Make our zone current.
     }
    Ptr p = NewPtr(size);       // Allocate memory for object.
    if (fZone)
      SetZone(savedZone);       // Restore previous zone.
    return p;
}</pre>
<p>
Last, we have the <code>operator delete</code> function. All it does is dispose of the memory<br>
occupied by the object. We don't need to swap in the private heap here, since the<br>
Memory Manager keeps track of the heap that the pointer belongs to for us.
</p>
<pre>void PtrObject::operator delete(void* p)
{
    DisposPtr((Ptr) p);         // This works regardless of the zone
                                // the pointer was allocated in.
}</pre>
<p>
That's all there is to the <code>PtrObject</code> class. If you wish to explore the stranger side of<br>
C++ (multiple inheritance and so on), you should use it, since it allows your<br>
creations to live in the complicated world of the Macintosh Memory Manager.
