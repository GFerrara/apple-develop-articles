<h2>APPLE II Q &amp; A</h2>
<h1>APPLE II DEVELOPER TECHNICAL SUPPORT</h1>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>In the previous issue of</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;d e v e l o p<i> , an answer said that anyone doing a Close with</i><br>
<i>reference number zero will close New Desk Accessory resource forks. Does this mean</i><br>
<i>my NDA can't use resources?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>No. It means that your NDA can't open its resource fork at DAInit time and expect it<br>
to always be open. You can use resources in an NDA by opening the resource fork when<br>
your DA is opened and closing it when your DA is closed. Although an application could<br>
still close your resource fork while your DA window is open but&nbsp;&nbsp;not active, this is not<br>
likely.

<b>Q </b><i>Matt, I found your caching article to be very informative, but I'm confused about the</i><br>
<i>driver level of caching. You say that if the cachePriority word on GS/OS direct page is</i><br>
<i>zero, the driver should not write the block to the cache. If the block was already in the</i><br>
<i>cache, won't this mean the disk has a different block than is in the cache, messing</i><br>
<i>things up drastically?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Thanks, and yes. When a driver is supposed to ignore the cache on a write call<br>
(because the cachePriority field is zero), it still must deal with the possibility that<br>
the block may already be in the cache. When writing with cachePriority zero, drivers<br>
may not add new blocks to the cache but must update blocks that are <i>already </i> in the<br>
cache. This step is necessary because the next time someone reads with caching<br>
enabled, the block in the cache will be returned. Next time I forget something, I<br>
promise that it will be&nbsp;&nbsp;less important.

<b>Q </b><i>I did a SelectMember2 on an extended list control, and the list was drawn at a funny</i><br>
<i>place in my window. What gives?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The current port was not set to the window that the list control was in. Most List<br>
Manager calls, and many other toolbox calls, require that the current grafPort be<br>
explicitly set. Before you call SelectMember2, set the current port to your window<br>
with a SetPort call. Remember the note in the<i>Apple IIGS Toolbox Reference,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;volume 2,<br>
under the NewWindow call-- "Important: NewWindow does not set the current port,<br>
but many routines require that a current port exist. Use the QuickDraw II routine<br>
SetPort to set the current port." Using SetPort can prevent toolbox confusion and<br>
reduce your debugging time.

<p>
<b>Q </b><i>Someone told me that there's an easier way of keeping track of double and triple</i><br>
<i>clicks in System Software 5.0 and later. What is it? </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The extended Task Record introduced in System Software 5.0 includes a new field<br>
called wmClickCount, at offset $1C. If you're using TaskMaster in your application, set<br>
bit 19 of your wmtaskMask (the tmMultiClick bit) and TaskMaster will keep the<br>
wmClickCount field updated. Every time there is a mouse-down event within the limits<br>
set by the user in the control panel setting 'Double Click', TaskMaster will increment<br>
wmClickCount by 1. If you're interested in double or triple clicks, check<br>
wmClickCount on every mouse-down-related event.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it's at 2, then a double click<br>
was the last mouse-down result, three, it was a triple click. In fact, you can track as<br>
many closely spaced clicks as you like--quintuple, sextuple, on up--if you really<br>
want to get silly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple recommends not going further than triple-clicking since<br>
more clicks become quite unwieldy.

<b>Q </b><i>What the heck is the resource ID for a control color table, and why is it so hard to</i><br>
<i>find in the Types.Rez interface file?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The resource ID for control color tables is $800D, and is referenced in Types.Rez as<br>
resource name r_BBBB. It is listed under its regular name (rCtlColorTable) in<br>
Appendix E of the <i> Apple IIGS Toolbox Reference, </i> volume 3. The obscure name in<br>
Types.Rez and the lack of a resource structure either in Types.Rez or Appendix E is<br>
caused by the structure being variable, depending on the control type associated with<br>
the color table.

<b>Q </b><i>ACE compression and expansion don't work consistently for me. I can compress (or</i><br>
<i>expand) one sound correctly, but the next time I try it the results are all wrong. What</i><br>
<i>gives?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>You forgot to call ACECompBegin or ACEExpBegin between different compressions or<br>
expansions. ACE maintains information on the current operation in its direct page<br>
space to allow you to do multipart expansions or compressions. When you start<br>
working with a new sound sample, you have to call either ACECompBegin or<br>
ACEExpBegin to inform ACE that you're starting a new operation, and all the internal<br>
data should be reset.&nbsp;&nbsp;More information can be found in the ACE chapter of the <i>Apple</i><br>
<i>IIGS Toolbox Reference, </i> volume 3.

<p>
<b>Q </b><i>Do I need to purchase APW Tools &amp; Interfaces if I already bought Programming Tools</i><br>
<i>&amp; Interfaces for APW? </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Yes! The original <i>Programming Tools &amp; Interfaces </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;utilities did not correctly<br>
support ORCA/Pascal and ORCA/C. Also, every tool in the package has been updated and<br>
enhanced. A new C library, used to build some of the tools, had bugs fixed in it (and<br>
will be available separately later). The new package also includes completely revised<br>
Apple II GS interfaces for APW C and the APW/ORCA assembler. The new <i>APW Tools &amp;</i><br>
<i>Interfaces </i> package is a class 1 product that may be ordered from Developer Tools<br>
Express; the previous class 2 product is no longer supported.
