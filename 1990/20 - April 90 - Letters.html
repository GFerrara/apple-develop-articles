<h2>LETTERS</h2>
<b>THE GOOD</b><br>
Wow!<br>
--Jim Russell<br>
<p>
We just received the first issue of&nbsp;&nbsp;develop.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just what we need.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it couldn't<br>
come at a better time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, please continue to do it--we need it!&nbsp;&nbsp;Great idea, great<br>
layout, great topics, etc....<br>
--Daniel Tapie
</p>
<p>
Thanks a lot for the complimentary first issue of&nbsp;&nbsp;develop.&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes me feel healthy<br>
with the funny introduction of the authors, wealthy with its luxury, and happy for<br>
your name is nicer than ever on the first page.<br>
--Philippe
</p>
<p>
I believe you have a winner here!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;develop has helped me in just the first 10 minutes.<br>
I needed help with the Palette Manager and I found it here!
</p>
<p>
Might I suggest that the CD-ROM envelope be perforated?&nbsp;&nbsp;This would allow easy<br>
removal of the packet and alleviate the "now I have the CD-ROM out, but the packet is<br>
still in the way when I flip through the pages" syndrome.<br>
--Bryan Carter
</p>
<p>
Fantastic idea!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep up the good work.&nbsp;&nbsp;This first issue was FULL of good, timely, and<br>
useful advice (code).&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your efforts to help developers.<br>
--Ken Duncan
</p>
<p>
Excellent magazine!&nbsp;&nbsp;I really enjoyed the articles, source code examples, backgrounds<br>
on the authors, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;I predict that develop will establish a new standard of excellence<br>
in technical support literature. But please find a better font for the source code<br>
listings; the font is so faint that I found myself suffering from eye strain after a short<br>
while.<br>
--Ken Friedenbach
</p>
<p>
What a fantastic idea!&nbsp;&nbsp;The graphic design in&nbsp;&nbsp;develop is so good that it almost distracts<br>
from the content.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep up the good work and please send the next issue (this one was<br>
stolen...).<br>
--Jean-Michel Karr
</p>
<p>
<b>THE BAD</b><br>
develop has NOTHING to offer an Apple II owner/developer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple no longer has my<br>
respect as the founder of the home computing and friendly interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want a<br>
Mac and the way I feel at this moment I would not have a Mac if you gave it to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes,<br>
I am angry!<br>
--R. L. Woodworth
</p>
<p>
The outstanding quality of the premier issue of&nbsp;&nbsp;develop was overshadowed by its<br>
content.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have been appropriate in a premier issue to devote approximately<br>
equal space to BOTH Apple lines of computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple II support in&nbsp;&nbsp;develop would<br>
surely help Apple and encourage those who acknowledge the IIs as very respectable<br>
computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;May the Apple II and Macintosh lines BOTH enjoy continued and increasing<br>
success in their respective markets!<br>
--Steven Gozdziewski
</p>
<p>
<i>Like other commodities,</i> develop<i>is influenced by the laws of supply and demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;I<br>
publish articles based on what I have and on what I believe the development community<br>
needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a definite need for Apple II information, and</i> develop<i>will continue to be<br>
a forum in which to meet that need, but the mix of Apple II and Macintosh articles will<br>
continue to reflect the mix of developers and their needs (and available articles),<br>
rather than an absolute 50-50 balance.<br>
--Louella</i>
</p>
<p>
The situation on technical information has just gotten worse with&nbsp;&nbsp;develop.&nbsp;&nbsp;We now<br>
have <i> Inside Macintosh</i> , Technical Notes, the Q &amp; A stack,&nbsp;&nbsp;develop, and many other<br>
documents available through APDA.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these have information not found anywhere<br>
else.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a total nightmare when I want to find all the information on a particular<br>
topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really, really, REALLY would like ALL Macintosh technical information in one<br>
regularly updated reference.&nbsp;&nbsp;Get rid of all the others.<br>
--Tim Fredenburg
</p>
<p>
<i>Would you settle for having all of the pivotal information in one place (like a CD-ROM<br>
disc, for example), and for working toward an indexing scheme that would let you find<br>
out all of the documents (and pieces of sample code) that related to your topic of<br>
interest?&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the documents deserve (and need) to have lives of their own<br>
to address the needs of the folks who don't want to know absolutely everything about<br>
everything, but we also believe that an intelligent indexer would simplify things<br>
immensely.&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue's CD- ROM disc contains much of the information you'd like to<br>
see combined, and the next issue will have our first crack at the intelligent indexer. <br>
All comments and suggestions welcome.<br>
--Louella</i>
</p>
<p>
I'm curious to find out WHY Apple decided to go with a CD-ROM disc.&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that<br>
the disc holds gobs of data (which I would imagine goes mostly unused every issue);<br>
however, I wonder HOW MANY of the Mac and Apple II developers actually own a<br>
CD-ROM drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple may be trying to encourage developers to utilize this<br>
technology, but at the moment it looks like they are just flapping their wings in the<br>
breeze.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got a great idea!&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who can't use the CD-ROM disc should mail it<br>
back to Apple.&nbsp;&nbsp;A small, silent protest.&nbsp;&nbsp;:-)<br>
--Lynda
</p>
<p>
<i>The CD-ROM gives us room to archive all of the old issues of&nbsp;&nbsp;develop (which allows us<br>
to update and to correct mistakes every quarter), to publish code that would never fit<br>
in our hundred-some pages, and to explore what can be done when space is not a<br>
problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue of&nbsp;&nbsp;develop, the disc includes not only&nbsp;&nbsp;develop and all of its<br>
associated code, but also SpInside Macintosh (a HyperCard stack-based version of<br>
Inside Macintosh volumes I-V), the Macintosh Technical Notes stack, and the<br>
Macintosh DTS Q &amp; A stack, and of course, the ever-popular audio track. <br>

<b>THE UNCLASSIFIABLE</b><br>
Egad!&nbsp;&nbsp;I received my developer's package this noontime and found <i>develop</i> included in<br>
the package.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I haven't had quite the time I wanted to examine the material, I did<br>
notice two serious technical errors.&nbsp;&nbsp;To whit:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Louella, you've got to be under forty!  That pale gray print for the listings<br>
is--at least to my forty+ eyes, well nigh invisible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please take pity on us old<br>
codgers and not blind us!</li>
<li>Catching penguins is far easier than you suggest.  When I was stationed at<br>
McMurdo Sound a few decades ago, we simply recorded the sound of the local<br>
pod of Orcas and set up large speakers on three sides of a square.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we<br>
turned the recordings on, the poor pennies thought their mortal enemies were<br>
coming ashore and accordingly raced out of danger--right into our nets!</li>
</ol>
<p>
This boiled the bejabbers out of the biologists, but made our day!&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever see a penguin<br>
race?<br>
--Robert Smith
</p>
<p>
<i>I'm afraid I'm guilty on both counts: I am under forty (although I hope the code in this<br>
issue is easier on your eyes), and I did not fully test all of the questions and answers. <br>
In the future, I'll try to convince management that testing penguin-catching techniques<br>
is worth the trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure your letter will help.<br>
--Louella</i>
</p>
<p>
I noticed on page 2 that two "Spirit Guides" were listed.&nbsp;&nbsp;While trying to figure out<br>
what these might be, I thought of three possibilities: continuity editors (insure that<br>
each article adheres to a common theme); channelers or spiritists (as in New Age,<br>
religion, occult); or testers of wines or vineyards.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, now that I've had my guesses,<br>
could you tell me what the real answer is and what relation they have to your<br>
magazine?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is it all just a joke to see who REALLY reads your journal?<br>
--Rex Bontrager
</p>
<p>
<i>Margery and Lou both contributed immensely to actually getting develop into print;<br>
without the two of them, it would probably still be a bunch of manuscript pages sitting<br>
in my office and I'd still be thinking that printing was the opposite of cursive.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for<br>
the heading, they both make me smile and so does calling them Spirit Guides.&nbsp;&nbsp;(And it is<br>
good to see who's actually reading the masthead.)<br>
--Louella</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>QUESTIONS</b><br>
I like develop.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what's the deal with the code contained therein (on<br>
CD-ROM)?&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we use it?&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we distribute it?&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of those (at least the first)<br>
would seem to be the intent ofdevelop.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the lawyer's funfest at the back would seem<br>
to say otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wondered about this before I saw the article in MacWeek, but now<br>
I'm really confused.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is use of code contained on the CD-ROM as limited as seems to be<br>
implied by the CD-ROM container's text?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or what?<br>
--Robert
</p>
<p>
<i>You can freely use, copy, and distribute the code that's included in&nbsp;&nbsp;develop.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many<br>
thanks to Teri Drenker in Apple's software licensing group for this issue's revised<br>
licensing agreement.<br>
