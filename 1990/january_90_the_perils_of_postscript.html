<h2>THE PERILS OF POSTSCRIPT</h2>
<h1>SCOTT "ZZ" ZIMMERMAN</h1>
<p>
<i>Letting your application rather than the LaserWriter driver&nbsp;&nbsp;convert QuickDraw</i><br>
<i>commands into PostScript is simple in most cases, yet when you use direct PostScript</i><br>
<i>to print documents, subtle interactions between the QuickDraw and PostScript imaging</i><br>
<i>models can cause problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;This article will help you in two important areas: using a</i><br>
<i>font from PostScript while selecting it using QuickDraw and preserving your</i><br>
<i>PostScript state while using QuickDraw to select fonts.</i>
</p>
<p>
When selecting a PostScript font from QuickDraw, an application first calls GetFNum<br>
(see Inside Macintosh, volume I, page 223 [IM I-223]) to get the Font Family ID for a<br>
particular font.&nbsp;&nbsp;It then calls TextFont (IM I-171) to actually select it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The name<br>
passed to GetFNum is the name of the font as seen in the Font menu (for example,<br>
Helvetica). 
</p>
<p>
In PostScript, fonts are selected by name using the findfont (see PostScript Language<br>
Reference Manual, page 156 [PLRM 156]) and setfont (PLRM 215) operators.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the<br>
application attempts to select a font named Helvetica&#174;, however, it will find that this<br>
font doesn't exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because the LaserWriter performs a special operation on the<br>
font called encoding.&nbsp;&nbsp;Font encoding is the process of mapping missing characters into<br>
another font. 
</p>
<p>
For example, a character like &#248; may not exist in the standard Helvetica font.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order<br>
to provide that character, the LaserWriter driver will modify the Helvetica font,<br>
inserting a reference to the &#248; character in the Symbol font.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this is done, the font<br>
is no longer standard Helvetica, so it is renamed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual name is something like<br>
|_____Helvetica, but this naming convention is not standard and could change in the<br>
future.
</p>
<p>
So if you don't know the font's name, how can you select it?&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple, let QuickDraw do<br>
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you select a font via TextFont and then use it via one of the QuickDraw text<br>
drawing routines (such as DrawChar or DrawString [IM I- 172]), the LaserWriter<br>
driver handles the complex task of selecting an appropriate font on the PostScript<br>
device.&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes downloading and encoding the font if necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Using QuickDraw<br>
to select the font not only saves you a lot of work, but also improves compatibility. <br>
The process of font downloading and character encoding could change in the future, and<br>
if your application does it internally, it will have to be revised.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use QuickDraw<br>
to download the font, your application will be immune to changes in the font<br>
downloading mechanism.
</p>
<h2>PICK A FONT, ANY FONT</h2>
<p>
Now let's look at the code to actually select a font.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following procedure will select<br>
a font for any device, QuickDraw or PostScript:
</p>
<pre>PROCEDURE  SetFont;(fontName: Str255; fontSize: INTEGER;
    fontStyle: Style);
VAR
    theFontID:  INTEGER;
    thePenLoc:  Point;
BEGIN
    GetFNum(fontName, theFontID);   (* Get the font ID. *)
    TextFont(theFontID);    (* Set it *)
    TextSize(fontSize); (* Set the size *)
    TextFace(fontStyle);    (* ...and the style. *)
    GetPen(thePenLoc);  (* Save the current pen position. *)
    DrawChar(' ');  (* Draw a space so the font gets downloaded.*)
    MoveTo(thePenLoc.h, thePenLoc.v);   (* Restore original pen *)
                (* position. *)
END;</pre>
<p>
There are two important things to note in the SetFont procedure above.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the<br>
procedure uses the GetFNum trap to get the Font ID.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is essential to make sure that<br>
you get the correct font.&nbsp;&nbsp;(See Technical Note #191, Font Names for more<br>
information.) Second, the SetFont procedure calls DrawChar to draw a space.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is<br>
required to force the font selection on PostScript devices, since the TextFont call only<br>
changes the txFont field of the GrafPort. By actually using the font (via DrawChar) the<br>
LaserWriter driver's StdText GrafProc is called, and selects the font on the printer. <br>
Subsequent calls to the PostScript show (PLRM 222) operator will use this font. <br>
Since DrawChar will change the pen position, it is saved (via GetPen [IM I-169]) and<br>
restored (via MoveTo [IM I-170]).
</p>
<h2>ON WITH THE SHOW</h2>
<p>
Now that we have a font selected, we need to actually draw something with it. For now,<br>
as an example, let's say that we want to draw some text with the show operator.&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll<br>
send our PostScript using the following procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although convenient for sending<br>
PostScript in our example, this method is very inefficient and should not be used in an<br>
application.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's the code:
</p>
<pre>PROCEDURE SendPostScript(theComment: Str255);
    VAR
        PSCommand   : Str255;
        CommandHdl  : Handle;
        CRString    : Str255;
        theError    : OSErr;
    BEGIN
        CRString := ' ';
        CRString[1] := CHR(13);
        PSCommand := theComment;
        PSCommand := CONCAT(PSCommand, CRString);
        theError := PtrToHand(POINTER(ORD(@PSCommand) + 1),
            CommandHdl,LENGTH(PSCommand));
        if theError &lt;&gt; noErr THEN BEGIN
            (* Handle the error! *)
        END;
        PicComment(PostScriptHandle,
            LENGTH(PSCommand), CommandHdl);
        DisposHandle(CommandHdl);
    END;</pre>
<p>
The procedure simply takes a string of text, adds a carriage return at the end of it, and<br>
converts it into a handle.&nbsp;&nbsp;The handle is then passed to the PostScriptHandle picture<br>
comment, which actually sends it to the printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this procedure created the<br>
handle, the procedure also disposes of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this is not how a normal application<br>
would do it, but it keeps things nice and localized for this example.&nbsp;&nbsp;So now that we can<br>
send PostScript, consider the following:
</p>
<pre>SetFont('Helvetica', 14, [bold]);
PicComment(PostScriptBegin, 0, NIL);       
        (********************************************)
        (*** QuickDraw representation of graphic. ***)
        (********************************************)
    (* These calls are only executed by QuickDraw *)
    (* (i.e. non-PostScript) devices.   *)
        MoveTo(50, 50);
        DrawString('This is some gray text.');
        PenPat(ltGray);
        MoveTo(100, 100);
        LineTo(300, 300);
        (*********************************************)
        (*** PostScript representation of graphic. ***)
        (*********************************************)
    (* These calls will only be executed by PostScript devices.*)
    SendPostScript('50 50 moveto (This is some gray text.) show');
    SendPostScript('.10 setgray');
    SendPostScript('100 100 moveto 300 300 lineto stroke');
PicComment(PostScriptEnd, 0, NIL);</pre>
<p>
In this fragment, the call to SetFont sets the PostScript currentfont to be Helvetica. <br>
The PostScriptBegin comment is used to suppress QuickDraw calls on PostScript<br>
devices, and vice versa.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the LaserWriter sees PostScriptBegin, it ignores all<br>
QuickDraw drawing calls, and just executes picture comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a PostScriptEnd<br>
is received, the LaserWriter will once again interpret QuickDraw calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>
LaserWriter driver will ignore the QuickDraw representation, and begin executing the<br>
SendPostScript calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one draws a string of text, the second one changes the<br>
default gray level of the printer from 100% black to 10% black using the setgray<br>
(PLRM 216) operator, and the third one draws a diagonal line using the new gray<br>
level.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the QuickDraw representation for a gray level is handled by using<br>
PenPat (IM I-170).
</p>
<h2>SAVE THE POSTSCRIPT STATE</h2>
<p>
The fragment we just looked at illustrates a good method for sending both QuickDraw<br>
and PostScript.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also demonstrates a new problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the PostScriptBegin<br>
comment is sent, the LaserWriter driver performs a PostScript gsave (PLRM 166)<br>
operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;This saves the current graphics state required for QuickDraw printing. <br>
The application can then do what it needs to the state without having to worry about<br>
side effects on the QuickDraw environment. When the LaserWriter driver receives a<br>
PostScriptEnd comment, it performs a grestore (PLRM 165) operation to restore the<br>
QuickDraw state.&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally this is exactly what you would want.&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are cases<br>
when an application may want to execute some QuickDraw commands without losing the<br>
PostScript state is has setup.
</p>
<p>
For example, the above code fragment set the gray level of the printer to 10%. At the<br>
time we did the PostScriptEnd comment, the gray level was restored to 100%.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we<br>
then want to change the font size, and redraw the text, we would have to resend the<br>
setgray operator.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would look like this:
</p>
<pre>   (* Change the font size.*)
    SetFont('Helvetica', 24, [bold]);
    PicComment(PostScriptBegin, 0, NIL);       
        (********************************************)
        (*** QuickDraw representation of graphic. ***)
        (********************************************)
        (* These calls are only executed by QuickDraw *)
        (* (i.e. non-PostScript) devices.*)
        (* The QuickDraw state is unaffected, so there&#8217;s *)
        (* no need to call PenPat again. *)
        MoveTo(250, 50);
        LineTo(750, 50);

        (*********************************************)
        (*** PostScript representation of graphic. ***)
        (*********************************************)
        (* These calls only executed by PostScript devices. *)
        (* Since the PostScript state was cleared, we need *)
        (* to resend the setgray operator. *)
        SendPostScript('.10 setgray');
        SendPostScript('250 50 moveto 750 50 lineto');
    PicComment(PostScriptEnd, 0, NIL);</pre>
<p>
Although resending the setgray operator isn't difficult, an application may have set a<br>
lot more attributes.&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid the overhead of resending this state, a new comment may<br>
be used.&nbsp;&nbsp;This comment is #196--PostScriptBeginNoSave.
</p>
<p>
When PostScriptBeginNoSave is used with PostScriptEnd, the gsave and grestore<br>
operations are not performed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the application is completely<br>
responsible for the graphics state of the printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are doing all of your imaging<br>
via PostScript this is not a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you plan on mixing PostScript and QuickDraw,<br>
you must be very careful.&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes to attributes like line width and the transformation<br>
matrix will have a significant effect on QuickDraw drawing operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the comment<br>
is used for the above example, the code will look like this:
</p>
<pre>   (* Now illustrate the use of the PostScriptBeginNoSave  *)
    (* PicComment. *)
    PicComment(PostScriptBeginNoSave, 0, NIL);
        PenPat(ltGray);
        SendPostScript('.10 setgray');
    PicComment(PostScriptEnd, 0, NIL);
   
    (* At this point, the gray level of the device is 10% black *)
    (* Now draw something using this state. *)
    (* Draw a light gray line using QuickDraw. *)
    MoveTo(50, 400);
    Line(100, 100);
   
    (* At this point, the gray level is still 10%, so we must *)
    (* reset it  to black. *)
    PicComment(PostScriptBeginNoSave, 0, NIL);
        PenPat(black);  (* Reset QuickDraw gray level.  *)
        SendPostScript('1.0 setgray');  (* Reset PostScript gray*)
                                (* level.   *)
    PicComment(PostScriptEnd, 0, NIL);</pre>
<p>
Note that instead of sending PostScriptBegin as the first operation, we now send<br>
PostScriptBeginNoSave.&nbsp;&nbsp;We then change the gray level to light gray in the QuickDraw<br>
world, and 10% black for PostScript.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we used PostScriptBeginNoSave, sending<br>
PostScriptEnd does not effect the state of the printer (i.e. the gray level remains at<br>
10%).&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we want to draw something with the new state.&nbsp;&nbsp;We first send the<br>
PostScriptBegin comment, which saves the state we set up, as well as disabling the<br>
QuickDraw calls on PostScript devices. 
</p>
<p>
We then send a QuickDraw representation of the line, followed by PostScriptEnd.&nbsp;&nbsp;On<br>
QuickDraw devices, the line will be drawn using the ltGray pen pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;On PostScript<br>
devices, the line will be drawn using 10% black. After the line has been drawn, we<br>
need to reset the state of the device for subsequent drawing operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is done by<br>
once again sending the PostScriptBeginNoSave comment, followed by the commands to<br>
reset the gray level, as well as any other attributes of the printer.
</p>
<p>
In summary, we have looked at two ways of avoiding the perils of PostScript. The first<br>
was how to use a font from PostScript while choosing it using QuickDraw.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>
supported method for this was demonstrated by the SetFont procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second was<br>
how to preserve your PostScript state while still using QuickDraw to select fonts.
