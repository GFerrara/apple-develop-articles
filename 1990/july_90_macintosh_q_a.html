<h2>MACINTOSH Q &amp; A</h2>
<h1>MACINTOSH DEVELOPER TECHNICAL SUPPORT</h1>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>How can I keep track of a file the next time my application is launched?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Technical Note #238, Getting a&nbsp;&nbsp;Full Pathname, documents the recommended method<br>
for "remembering" a file's location.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;. . . you should remember the DirID of the directory the file is in along with its name.<br>
This way, you will still be able to find your file even if the directory has been moved.<br>
Under System 7.0 or later, save the file's unique 32-bit ID number as well, so that<br>
you can also find the file even if its name has changed.
</p>
<p>
To remember a file's location, keep&nbsp;&nbsp;the volume name, DirID, and filename. This<br>
information is all you need to locate any file. Standard File returns the DirID of the<br>
file in CurDirStore&nbsp;&nbsp;or the wdRefNum in the vRefNum field of the reply.record. Note<br>
that Technical Note #238 mentions how&nbsp;&nbsp;to get a file's DirID while in Standard File.<br>
Given the working directory, you can find its vRefNum and DirID by calling<br>
_GetWDInfo. Refer to <i>Inside Macintosh,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;volume IV. Volume references and working<br>
directories are dynamic; they change every time the system is booted, so you cannot<br>
use the vRefNum or wdRefNum. Typically, the volume name and filename are not<br>
changed. The DirID will not change unless the user deletes the folder. Renaming the<br>
folder does not change its DirID.
</p>
<p>
First ask the user to locate the file by calling SFGetFile. Keep the volume name, DirID,<br>
and filename for this file. The next time you want to locate the file, use this same<br>
information. If you do not find the file, then again call SFGetFile asking the user to<br>
locate it.
</p>
<p>
DTS has an example application, SC.018.StdFile, which you may find helpful. You can<br>
find this in the Sample Code folder on the enclosed <i>Developer Essentials</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;disc.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>How can I determine the size of my application's MultiFinder partition?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>It's really difficult to find the exact&nbsp;&nbsp;size of the memory partition that the<br>
application is running under. If it can be determined, I doubt that the effort would be<br>
worth the trouble. I think the real concern you have is the size of the available stack<br>
and heap, but not the entire partition. Since there is little that an application can do to<br>
change&nbsp;&nbsp;its partition size (except to change&nbsp;&nbsp;the 'SIZE' resource and then force a<br>
relaunch), the real concern would be&nbsp;&nbsp;to find the size of the available stack and heap.<br>
Included in the application's partition are the application parameters, jump table,<br>
application globals, and QuickDraw globals. The size of the partition is not easily<br>
determined. The only portions of an application's memory use that are adjustable at<br>
run time are the stack and the heap.The stack and heap sizes are fixed within the<br>
boundaries of the entire application partition. Increasing one decreases the other.<br>
There are Memory Manager calls to change the size of the heap. To increase the stack<br>
size, you decrease the heap's size.

<b>Q </b><i>In earlier versions of the Chooser, there was a limit of 16 volumes per server for</i><br>
<i>AppleShare servers. Has this limit changed in System 6.0.4?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The limit of 16 volumes per server in the Chooser has not changed with System<br>
6.0.4. We hope to have&nbsp;&nbsp;a new version of the Chooser for System 7.0.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>How do I force the Finder to update its windows after my application has changed a</i><br>
<i>file's FndrInfo?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>There is no direct way to tell the Finder to update the desktop. The Finder will<br>
synchronize the desktop file's appearance after it detects that&nbsp;&nbsp;the volume's<br>
modification date has changed. Whenever you create or delete a file, or move it to<br>
another folder, the hierarchical file system (HFS) will change the modification date of<br>
the volume and that folder. When the Finder has noticed the volume's modification date<br>
has changed, it begins scanning about&nbsp;&nbsp;once every 10 seconds for changes&nbsp;&nbsp;in all of the<br>
open folders.&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the file's FndrInfo or renaming it is not going to change the<br>
modification date. As a suggestion for an installer program, you can initially create a<br>
temporary file. Once all the files are installed you can delete the temporary file.<br>
Deleting this temporary file as a last step will cause the Finder's window to be updated.

<p>
<b>Q </b><i>My little application has two handles in memory that have been allocated. I want to</i><br>
<i>lock one handle high in memory and the other one low in memory. I noticed that the</i><br>
<i>Mac toolbox has the functionality to lock a handle high (MoveHHi); however, I did not</i><br>
<i>notice any routine that would move the block low in memory, before a lock. I'm looking</i><br>
<i>for a MoveHLow routine. Does one exist? If not, how would I go about doing this?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>There is no similar functionality for locking a handle low. The best way to go about<br>
doing this is to use NewPtr, which automatically allocates the block as low as possible.<br>
Of course, it's not a handle, but it's still a locked block as low in the heap as possible.
</p>
<p>
Another way to do this is to use ResrvMem which, as Inside Macintosh, volume 2, page<br>
39 says, "will try every available means to place the block as close as possible to the<br>
bottom of the zone, including moving other blocks upward, expanding the zone, or<br>
purging blocks from it." Then make your call to NewHandle with the same size as<br>
requested in ResrvMem. That'll allocate the handle as low as possible.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>How can I support multiple HFS partitions on a SCSI device?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>If at all possible, avoid trying to support partitions. We'll warn you up front that an<br>
ejectable drive that contains multiple HFS partitions is not going to be anything less<br>
than difficult. You'll be betteroff not attempting to support multiple HFS partitions. It<br>
greatly complicates the code, and there are user interface problems too. What if the<br>
user ejects one of the partitions? What should happen? This is technically difficult for<br>
the driver to handle.
</p>
<p>
If the user ejects a partition, then the driver might eject the media and mark all of its<br>
remaining partitions as off-line. If the user drags a partition to the trash, this should<br>
unmount only that partition (but then how would the user unmount the entire<br>
media?). The remaining partitions should be marked off-line and the user will see<br>
them as gray icons on the desktop. If users want to access one of these partitions,<br>
they'll get the Disk Switch alert. They need to insert the proper cartridge and the<br>
device will then post a disk insert event for every partition (because it cannot<br>
determine exactly which partition is really needed). This will again bring all<br>
partitions back. The trap _Offline should take care of all this for you, but it cannot be<br>
called at interrupt time. Therefore, the driver will need to use accRun calls to use<br>
_OffLine.
</p>
<p>
Again, the system doesn't support multiple HFS partitioned drives. It only expects to<br>
find one HFS partition on a volume. The system will attempt to read from the first HFS<br>
partition and then stop. If the first one is not bootable, then that device cannot be a<br>
startup device. If you attempt to put more than one partition on a device, then you have<br>
to perform additional hacks to mount them. Be warned that hacking this feature into<br>
your drive involves a compatibility risk. 
</p>
<p>
All the work will be up to the driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will have to find the extra partitions and<br>
mount them. Each partition will have a drive queue entry having each element<br>
reference the same driver. When your driver's open routine is called, you call<br>
_AddDrive for each partition. This calls _Enqueue and installs each element into the<br>
drive queue. Once the driver is closed, you should remove each of the queue elements<br>
with _Dequeue.

<b>Q </b><i>I would like to write James Brown in jail, but now that he is on work release, where</i><br>
<i>do I write?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>You can write the Godfather of Soul at<br>
Lower Savannah Work Center<br>
Route 4, Box 50<br>
Aiken, SC 29801
</p>
<p>
Brown is serving concurrent six-year and six-year-and-three month terms for his<br>
involvement in a wild, two-state car chase in September of 1988. He won't be eligible<br>
for parole until 1992.
