<h2>ACCESSING CD-ROM AUDIO TRACKS FROM YOUR<br>
APPLICATION</h2>

<h1>ERIC MUELLER</h1>
<p>
<i>CD-ROM opens up the possibility of providing the user of your application with a new</i><br>
<i>dimension of sound feedback, in full digitally reproduced stereo. Coaxing the sound out</i><br>
<i>of the AppleCD S C&#174; drive, however, is not as simple as prompting the user to "press</i><br>
<i>PLAY on your CD-ROM drive now." This article explains the intricacies of controlling</i><br>
<i>the audio functions of the AppleCD SC from an Apple II application.</i>
</p>
<p>
Imagine how you might use CD-ROM audio tracks to make your software burst with<br>
sound: language software that pronounces each lesson as it teaches it; reading programs<br>
that speak words instead of just displaying them; almost any kind of program adapted<br>
with audio cues for an audience with reading disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CD-ROM is also the answer<br>
for applications that require lengthy music tracks or background music that simply<br>
won't fit on the program disk in a digitized format.
</p>
<p>
In this article, you'll learn about the capabilities of the AppleCD SC drive, and the<br>
kinds of calls you can make to the drive to control the audio features. The article also<br>
covers basic information about how audio tracks are stored on CD-ROM. (While the<br>
primary focus of this article is the Apple II, this section applies to the Macintosh as<br>
well.) Finally, it covers the specifics of playing audio tracks via the GS/OS<i>&#174;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;SCSI CD<br>
driver and the five major audio control calls.
</p>
<h2>AN OVERVIEW OF THE AUDIO CAPABILITY</h2>
<p>
You make the AppleCD SC do your bidding by sending it the GS/OS device calls<code> DStatus</code><br>
and<code>DControl </code>via the GS/OS SCSI CD driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;These calls enable you to control all<br>
features of the drive.
</p>
<p>
You get information about the contents of the disc in the drive and the current status of<br>
the drive with two<code> DStatus </code>subcalls:<code> ReadTOC </code>and<code> AudioStatus</code>.
</p>
<p>
You control audio play with five<code> DControl </code>subcalls:<code> AudioPlay</code>,<code> AudioPause</code>,<br>
<code>AudioScan</code>,<code>AudioStop</code>, and<code> AudioSearch</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These calls start and stop the disc from<br>
spinning inside the AppleCD SC, and position the laser.
</p>
<p>
We'll look at each of these functions in greater detail in the sections that follow, and<br>
illustrate them with code for a CD Remote classic desk accessory (CDA).&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll find<br>
the complete source code on the <i>Developer Essentials</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;disc in Merlin 16+ format.&nbsp;&nbsp;This<br>
code serves three purposes: first, it enables you to experiment with the AppleCD SC<br>
drive and see how it responds to certain calls. Second, it documents the exact steps<br>
necessary to make audio calls. Finally, you can modify and extend it with your own test<br>
code.
</p>
<h2>TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE DRIVE</h2>
<p>
Your Apple II application can communicate with the AppleCD SC through calls built<br>
into either the SmartPort or the GS/OS SCSI CD driver. Accessing the AppleCD SC's<br>
audio features via the Smartport or from the Macintosh side of things is very well<br>
documented, while documentation about using the GS/OS SCSI CD driver is not as<br>
complete (yet).&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll focus here on how to access the AppleCD SC via GS/OS.
</p>
<p>
Issuing CD SC commands from your program is a two-step process: first you must<br>
locate the drive with a<code> DInfo </code>call, and then you can use<code> DStatus </code>and<code> DControl </code>to<br>
check the status and control the device. The control data you send will be parameter<br>
lists for the audio calls; the status data you receive will be information about the disc<br>
in the drive.
</p>
<p>
<b>DINFO</b> Locating the drive with<code> DInfo </code>is fairly straightforward: you step through<br>
each of the available devices until you find one that has a<code> deviceIDNum </code>of $0007<br>
(SCSI CD ROM drive). If your<code>DInfo </code>call returns an error $11, that means that<br>
you've hit the end of the device chain, and that no CD SC drive is hooked up.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example from the sample program of how to locate the attached AppleCD SC<br>
drive:
</p>
<pre>FindCDRom
         lda   CDROMDev   ;Have we found it before?
         bne   :leave     ;Yes - leave now.

:look                     ;Start looking for drive.
         jsl   GSOS
         dw    DInfo      ;Make GS/OS DInfo call.
         adrl  :devParm
         bcs   :err       ;Leave if error.

         lda   devID      ;Get device ID.
         cmp   #$0007     ;Is it a SCSI CD-ROM device?
         beq   :found     ;Yes - found it.

         inc   devNum     ;No - move to next device . . .
         bra   :look      ;and keep looking.

:found   lda   devNum
         sta   CDROMDev
         sta   DCdevNum   ;Store device number for all control calls.
         sta   DSdevNum   ;Store device number for all status calls.

         beq   :none      ;Yes - no CD-ROM drive found!
         ~WriteCString #:error ;No - some other weird error.
         bra   :1

;quit. &#8216;0700

         adrl  nameBuffer ;Pointer to buffer for device name.

         dl    0          ;TotalBlocks.
         dw    0          ;SlotNum.
         dw    0          ;UnitNum.
         dw    0          ;Version.
devID    dw    0          ;Device ID: $0007 = SCSI CD-ROM.

nameBuffer dw  31         ;Max length.
         ds    33         ;Storage for device name.</pre>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;DSTATUS AND DCONTROL</b> Once you've found the drive, exchanging information<br>
with&nbsp;&nbsp;it is simply a matter of<code> DStatus </code>and<code> DControl </code>calls.<code> DStatus </code>enables you to<br>
receive status data from the drive;<code> DControl</code> enables you to send control data to the<br>
drive.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The main parameter table for<code> DControl </code>and<code> DStatus </code>contains a parameter count,<br>
the device number you're working with, the control (or status) code, a pointer to the<br>
command data, a request count (used for status calls), and a transfer count.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The command data information is a parameter list of 18 bytes (see Figure 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>
first two are reserved and must be 0; the following byte is the SCSI command (which<br>
is the same as the control/status code low byte). Next is a block of 11 bytes: these are<br>
specific to each call. Finally, the command data parameter list ends with a long pointer<br>
to another buffer, where SCSI data is returned from the status calls.
</p>

<h2>TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE DISC IN THE DRIVE</h2>
<p>
The AppleCD SC has two important calls for finding out more about the disc in the<br>
drive:<code>ReadTOC </code>(to read the table of contents) and<code> AudioStatus </code>(to find out exactly<br>
what the drive is doing). These calls are useful immediately after the user has inserted<br>
a new (foreign) disc, to ascertain the disc's layout and whether the disc is currently<br>
playing, searching, paused, or muted. They are also useful in the case where you've<br>
placed one application on several different discs, each with a different audio track<br>
layout. 
</p>
<p>
<b>READTOC</b><br>
The<code> ReadTOC </code>call can return data in three ways, known as types $00, $01, and $02.<br>
You specify the type in the<code> ReadTOC </code>parameter list.
</p>
<p>
A type $00 table of contents returns the value of the first and last tracks available on<br>
the disc. Tracks are numbered consecutively, starting with 1, and the type $00 table<br>
of contents always returns $01 as the value for the first track on the disc.
</p>
<p>
Type $01 gives you the disc lead-out time in minutes, seconds, and blocks. (The<br>
lead-out time is the total time of all tracks on the disc, including the data track, if one<br>
exists.)
</p>
<p>
Finally, type $02, the most flexible of the three, returns starting address information<br>
(control field, minutes, seconds, and blocks) for each track on the disc. You can<br>
specify how many bytes the call will return and which track to start on, which makes<br>
it possible to find out about a single track instead of all of the tracks on the disc.
</p>
<p>
Examples of using the<code> ReadTOC </code>call can be found in the "NewDisc" and "Play" routines<br>
of the accompanying source code.
</p>
<p>
<b>AUDIOSTATUS</b>The<code> AudioStatus </code>call returns the current status of the drive, the<br>
current play mode, the control field of the current track, and the Q Subcode for either<br>
the next track on the disc (if a track is currently playing) or the current track (if a<br>
track is not currently playing).
</p>
<p>
The current status of the drive is reported as one of six messages: AudioPlay operation<br>
in progress, Pause operation in progress, Muting On operation in progress, AudioPlay<br>
completion status, Error during AudioPlay operation status, or AudioPlay operation<br>
not requested.
</p>
<p>
The play mode is how audio will be output.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has the following possible values:
</p>
<p><table border="0"><tr><td><b>Bits</b></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>3210</td><td></b>Effect</td></tr>
<tr><td>0000</td><td> Muting on (no audio)</td></tr>
<tr><td>0001</td><td> Right channel through right channel only</td></tr>
<tr><td>0010</td><td> Left channel through right channel only</td></tr>
<tr><td>0011</td><td> Both channels through right channel only</td></tr>
<tr><td>0100</td><td> Right channel through left channel only</td></tr>
<tr><td>0101</td><td> Right channel through left and right channel</td></tr>
<tr><td>0110</td><td> Right channel through left channel, left channel through</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>right channel (reversed)</td></tr>
<tr><td>0111</td><td> Right channel through left channel, both channels through</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>right channel</td></tr>
<tr><td>1000</td><td> Left channel through left channel only</td></tr>
<tr><td>1001</td><td> Left channel through left channel, right channel through</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>right channel (stereo)</td></tr>
<tr><td>1010</td><td> Left channel through left and right channels</td></tr>
<tr><td>1011</td><td> Left channel through left channel, both channels through</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>right channel</td></tr>
<tr><td>1100</td><td> Both channels through left channel</td></tr>
<tr><td>1101</td><td> Both channels through left channel, right channel through</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>right channel</td></tr>
<tr><td>1110</td><td> Both channels through left channel, left channel through</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>right channel</td></tr>
<tr><td>1111</td><td> Both channels through left channel, both channels through</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>right channel (mono)</td></tr></table></p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The control field describes the format of the current track, and has the following<br>
possible values:
</p>
<p><table border="0"><tr><td><b>Bits</b></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>3210</td><td></b>Effect</td></tr>
<tr><td>00x0</td><td> Two audio channels without preemphasis</td></tr>
<tr><td>00x1</td><td> Two audio channels with preemphasis</td></tr>
<tr><td>10x0</td><td> Four audio channels without preemphasis</td></tr>
<tr><td>10x1</td><td> Four audio channels with preemphasis</td></tr>
<tr><td>01x0</td><td> Data track</td></tr>
<tr><td>01x1</td><td> Reserved</td></tr>
<tr><td>11xx</td><td> Reserved</td></tr>
<tr><td>xx0x</td><td> Digital copy prohibited</td></tr>
<tr><td>xx1x</td><td> Digital copy permitted</td></tr></table></p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The Q Subcode is the absolute address of either the next track on the disc (if a track is<br>
currently playing) or the current track (if a track is not currently playing). It<br>
consists of the track starting address in minutes, seconds, and blocks. With the Q<br>
Subcode, you can quickly tell where the laser is positioned.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Here is a short example of getting the drive status and reporting it to the user:
</p>
<pre>Status
         ~WriteCString #:stat

         jsr   ZeroParamList ;Zap old parameter list.

         lda   #$0006        ;Get six bytes from AudioStatus.
         sta   DSrequest
         lda   #AudioStatus  ;Make this call.
         jsr   DoDStatus
         shortacc
         lda   buffer        ;Get audio status.
         longacc
         cmp   #5+1
         bge   :bad
         asl                 ;*2 so offset into table is correct.
         tay

<h2>TO PLAY AUDIO TRACKS</h2>
<p>
Five main audio calls are available to the programmer to control the audio features of<br>
the AppleCD SC drive:
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p><table border="0"><tr><td><code>AudioPlay </td><td></code> This call enables you to start the drive on an audio playback</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>operation (you pass it the play mode), or to specify a stop</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>address for audio playback.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>AudioStop</td><td></code> Like<code> AudioPlay</code>, this call enables you to specify a stop</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>address for audio playback.<code> AudioStop </code>can be used to set up</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>a stop address prior to issuing an<code> AudioPlay </code>call starting</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>playback.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>AudioPause</td><td></code> This call enables you to temporarily stop the audio playback</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>operation by turning on muting and holding the laser over the</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>same Q Subcode address. <code> AudioPause </code>also enables you to</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>resume the audio playback operation after it has been stopped</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>with a previous<code> AudioPause </code>operation. This call is useful if</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>you wish to pause audio playback on the fly and resume it</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>instantly, without any delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>AudioSearch</td><td></code> This call enables you to position the laser over an address on</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>the disc (a specified track or Q Subcode). This can be useful if</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>it is crucial that your application be able to start playback at</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>a certain time: you can first search to the specific track and</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>then hold the disc there, later issuing an<code> AudioPlay</code></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>command (which will begin play immediately).</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><code>AudioSearch </code>can also be set to start playing as soon as the</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>specified address is located.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>AudioScan</td><td></code> This call causes a fast-forward or fast-reverse scan</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>operation,&nbsp;&nbsp;starting from the address passed to it.</td></tr></table></p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The steps to play an audio track from your application are fairly straightforward:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the last track you wish to play and set it with the<code>AudioStop</code><br>
command.</li>
<li>Choose the first track you wish to play and pass it to<code>AudioPlay</code> with the<br>
stop flag set to 0.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you wish to play a single track, pass the same track number for both commands. If<br>
you want to simply start playback on a given track and allow the disc to play to the end,<br>
pass the last track number to<code> AudioStop </code>and the track to begin playback on to<br>
<code>AudioPlay.</code> (The last track number can be retrieved with a type $00<code> ReadTOC</code><br>
command.)
</p>
<p>
The<code> AudioScan </code>call is useful if you're allowing the user to directly control the disc<br>
from the application; otherwise, there is little need to fast-forward or fast-rewind<br>
when your program is already aware of the layout of the disc.<code> AudioPause </code>and<br>
<code>AudioSearch </code>are two practical ways to prepare the disc for playback without delay,<br>
and then pause and resume it. By using<code>AudioSearch </code>before your program needs to<br>
begin playback, you can have the disc spinning and the laser positioned exactly where<br>
it needs to be.
</p>
<h2>TO SUM IT ALL UP</h2>
<p>
By now, you're familiar with the many advantages and possibilities that CD-ROM audio<br>
access can provide your application. You know the layout of an audio track on CD-ROM<br>
and how to find out more about the track from your application.
</p>
<p>
You know the five major audio calls and a handful of supporting calls. You know what<br>
they can do for you and why you might want to use them.
</p>
<p>
You're ready to produce an application that takes full advantage of the AppleCD SC<br>
drive, equipping your program with the ability to produce sound and music of<br>
unequaled quality.
</p>
<h2>ABOUT CD-ROM AUDIO TRACK FORMAT</h2>
<p>
Audio data on a CD-ROM is stored in tracks. A CD can have a maximum of 99 tracks.<br>
Each track is broken down into minutes, seconds, blocks, frames, and finally, bytes, as<br>
shown in Figure 2. Tracks are numbered consecutively starting with 1, while<br>
minutes, seconds, blocks, and frames are numbered consecutively starting with 0. 
</p>
<p>
This format enables exact specification of a location on a CD-ROM.&nbsp;&nbsp;A location can be<br>
specified by absolute block number (for example, start playing at absolute block<br>
1,234,567 from the start of the disc), or by absolute minute, second, and block<br>
number (for example, start playing at minute 42, second 30, block 15 on the disc),<br>
or by logical track number (for example, start playing&nbsp;&nbsp;at track 2).
</p>
<p>
Note that blocks are often referred to as frames in&nbsp;&nbsp;CD-ROM industry documentation;<br>
following that lead, you'll see references to disc data in minute-second- frame format<br>
in my source code when it's truly in minute-second-block format. There is no way to<br>
access individual frames (1/98th of a block) or bytes of the disc with the AppleCD SC<br>
drive; however, for audio playback, it is unnecessary and presents no handicap.

lists for each of the CD SC status and control calls.
</p>
<p>
(Note that on page 64 of the<i>GS/OS Reference</i> , volume 2, in the parameter list for<br>
the<code>AudioPause</code> call, the value for start pause in the pause flag byte [$02] should be<br>
$10, not $40.) The<i>AppleCD SC Developers Guide</i> gives an explanation of every call. <br>
The<i>GS/OS SCSI Driver (General) External ERS</i> (not presently available from APDA)<br>
contains the most up-to-date and correct parameter lists for the audio calls. *
