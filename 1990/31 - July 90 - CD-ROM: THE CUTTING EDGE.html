<h1>CD-ROM: THE CUTTING EDGE</h1>

<h1>MARK B. JOHNSON</h1>
<p>
<i>Just as applications changed when hard disks became widely available, they are<br>
beginning to change again to take advantage of the newest storage technology to go<br>
mainstream: CD-ROM. The acronym, which stands for Compact Disc--Read Only<br>
Memory, doesn't begin to tell how the technology can liberate your applications from<br>
the currently established limitations of magnetic media. This article discusses the ups<br>
and downs of CD-ROM and looks at simple and creative ways developers can take<br>
advantage of this new medium.</i>
</p>
<p>
With its advantages over traditional magnetic media, CD-ROM can help you establish a<br>
real difference between your products and those of your competitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;It can enable you<br>
to produce ground-breaking applications at an affordable cost, unconstrained by disk<br>
space limitations. Although it does have its own limitations,&nbsp;&nbsp;its advantages and the<br>
possibilities they offer should be enough to convince you to make the investment in<br>
this competitive weapon.
</p>
<h2>THE CD-ROM EDGE</h2>
<p>
CD-ROM puts traditional magnetic media to shame in more ways than one. Beyond the<br>
obvious advantages of high capacity and low cost, no magnetic media can match CD-ROM<br>
in the areas of versatility, durability, portability, and interchangeability.
</p>
<p>
<b>Capacity.</b> Optical encoding of digital data enables storage of up to 660 MB of<br>
information on a single 120-mm CD-ROM disc. It would take more than 800 floppy<br>
disks to hold the same amount of information. Although some recording techniques<br>
limit CD-ROM discs to 550 MB, even a disc with this lower limit holds more<br>
information than hundreds of floppy disks.
</p>
<p>
<b>Economy.</b> You would think that with its capacity and durability, CD-ROM would be<br>
quite expensive. On the contrary, when you need to distribute at least 10 MB of data to<br>
100 or more people, CD- ROM is a very cost-effective medium. Large numbers of<br>
discs (over 1,000 units) can be produced for near two dollars per disc, almost as low<br>
a cost as for producing a standard 800K floppy disk.
</p>
<p>
<b>Versatility.</b> A CD-ROM disc can contain both digital data and high-quality digital<br>
audio tracks (usually copied directly from a digital audio tape). Thus, this technology<br>
opens the door to newcombinations of data and sound on a single medium. See Eric<br>
Mueller's article "Accessing CD- ROM Audio Tracks From Your Application" in this<br>
issue for insight into how such things are done.
</p>
<p>
<b>Durability.</b> Because CD-ROM is a read-only medium, a disc has a high degree of data<br>
integrity once it is pressed. Users cannot erase or overwrite the data, nor can they<br>
accidentally infect the disc with the latest virus. CD-ROM discs are mostly comprised<br>
of, and completely coated by, durable plastic. This construction, combined with the fact<br>
that the data encoding method used today provides its own error correction, makes<br>
CD-ROM a highly stable and durable medium, resistant to the handling and magnetic<br>
damage that commonly affect other types of media. (To prove this point a few years<br>
ago, an Apple engineer buried some CD-ROM discs in his cat's litter box for a week. He<br>
then wiped the discs clean and successfully read all the data from them.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Portability.</b> Another advantage of optical technology is its portability. Unlike most<br>
sealed hard disk platters, CD-ROM discs can be removed from a CD-ROM drive. This<br>
feature gives the user a virtually unlimited amount of storage space without locking<br>
him or her into a single type of information from minute to minute.
</p>
<p>
<b>Interchangeability.</b> Any CD-ROM player can read any CD-ROM disc at the bit level,<br>
since all CD- ROM discs, whether they contain data, audio, or both, share a common<br>
physical format. To go one step farther, developers can use a standard file system<br>
format to enable users to access a disc on a variety of hardware configurations under<br>
several different operating systems. Brian Bechtel's article "The Ins and Outs of ISO<br>
9660 and High Sierra" in this issue explores the two standard file system formats.<br>
Developers can also mix partitions on a disc so that it can be read by both the<br>
Macintosh &#174; operating system and ProDOS &#174;, as explained in Llew Roberts's article<br>
"How to Create a Mixed- Partition CD-ROM" in this issue.
</p>
<h2>SO WHAT'S THE CATCH?</h2>
<p>
All this for one low price? There must be a catch. Not exactly. Some minor limitations,<br>
yes--in the areas of speed, inability to write on the medium, and cost&nbsp;&nbsp;of a CD-ROM<br>
drive--but no show-stoppers.
</p>
<p>
<b>Speed. </b>Due to the mass of the optical read head and the data encoding methods used,<br>
reading from a CD-ROM disc is slower than reading from a good hard disk, but still<br>
faster than reading from a floppy. The speed of reading from disc, which is 150K per<br>
second, is sufficient for just about anything but uncompressed, full-motion color<br>
video, but any application that requires a lot of disc access (for example, HyperCard)<br>
suffers some performance degradation if run directly from CD- ROM instead of from a<br>
hard disk. Of course, if you are just using CD-ROM as a means of distributing your<br>
software, then speed really is not a problem since users are most likely going to copy<br>
your software to their hard disks or file servers to use. But even in cases where speed<br>
does matter, there are things you can do to address this concern; see the sidebar<br>
"Maximizing CD-ROM Speed."
</p>
<p>
<b>Inability to write. </b>The read-only feature that makes CD-ROM so durable is<br>
considered by some to be a disadvantage to this technology. Since you cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;erase or<br>
overwrite CD-ROM, it is not a replacement for magnetic media.&nbsp;&nbsp;Optical technologies<br>
that allow writing as well as reading are coming to the market--including read- only<br>
and erasable-optical discs, laser videodiscs, and WORM (write once, read many)<br>
discs--but none of these can currently match the cost-effectiveness of CD-ROM for<br>
electronic publishing and distribution.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cost of a drive.</b> Although Apple recently cut the price of the AppleCD SC to be<br>
comparable to that of an average-sized hard disk, many developers still consider the<br>
cost prohibitive for the mainstream user, and therefore do not consider a CD-ROM<br>
drive a mainstream peripheral. It is true that today's installed base of CD-ROM drives<br>
is small, but it is beginning to grow at a faster rate as more and more new titles<br>
appear on the market. Here we have the familiar chicken-or-egg problem: developers<br>
want to wait for the installed base to reach a certain point before they develop for CD-<br>
ROM, and users want to wait for the number of useful CD-ROM products to reach a<br>
certain point before they buy a CD-ROM drive.
</p>
<p>
Still, the fact is that it may only take a single blockbuster CD-ROM to motivate many<br>
people to buy. For example, when Apple's Developer Technical Support group produced<br>
the original <i> Phil &amp; Dave's Excellent CD </i> (now a collector's item), many developers<br>
found it reason enough to buy a CD-ROM drive. If your product is good enough, people<br>
will purchase the necessary hardware to use it. And remember that competition is<br>
forcing the cost of CD-ROM drives and discs ever downward, so you can bet that by the<br>
time you get your product to market, price will be less of a limiting factor than it is<br>
now.
</p>
<h2>A WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES</h2>
<p>
Thanks to its advantages over other technologies and despite its minor limitations,<br>
CD-ROM opens up a world of new possibilities to the developer. CD-ROM is especially<br>
suited to
</p>
<ul>
<li> distributing large products</li>
<li> creating new or enhanced versions of products</li>
<li> distributing application environments</li>
<li> enabling collaborative products</li>
<li> distributing information products</li>
<li> enabling interactive media products</li>
<li> enabling user interaction in a learning environment</li>
</ul>
<p>
We'll look at some examples of each of these kinds of uses.
</p>
<p>
As we look at these examples, keep in mind that although building a CD-ROM is<br>
essentially as easy as cloning a hard disk, building in a look and feel that takes full<br>
advantage of the medium is a more challenging task. You must pay attention to simple<br>
things like data organization and window size and position on the disc. If&nbsp;&nbsp;a CD-ROM is<br>
not well organized, your user might as well be dealing with 825 individual floppy<br>
disks. Ideally, you want to present a consistent interface and make it as visually<br>
appealing as possible to the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>DISTRIBUTING LARGE PRODUCTS</b><br>
The simplest way to use CD-ROM is as a distribution medium for relatively large and<br>
complex software products. Development system environments and other<br>
comprehensive products like them are perfect candidates for CD-ROM distribution.<br>
With the increased disk space, you can include several different preconfigured<br>
versions that a user need only copy to a hard disk without going through a complicated<br>
installation procedure.
</p>
<p>
If your product requires a specific version of Apple's system software, you can license<br>
the software from Apple Software Licensing (20525 Mariani Avenue, M/S 38-I,<br>
Cupertino, CA 95014, 408/974- 4667) and include it on the CD-ROM to make sure<br>
your users have everything they need to run your product when they acquire it.For<br>
Apple, products like MPW &#174;, MacApp&#174; , and System Software 7.0 are great<br>
candidates for CD- ROM distribution, but the real win with CD-ROM technology&nbsp;&nbsp;is to<br>
create products that you may not have even thought possible prior to the availability of<br>
this medium.
</p>
<p>
<b>CREATING NEW OR ENHANCED VERSIONS OF PRODUCTS</b><br>
CD-ROM gives developers the opportunity to produce new or enhanced versions of<br>
their products that just would not be feasible with floppy disk-based distribution.<br>
These enhancements can include expanded help systems (since basic on-line help<br>
should already be in every good application), full- blown tutorials that use graphics,<br>
sound, and animation to provide users with a rich learning environment, advanced<br>
technical or support information, and any other supplemental components that add<br>
value to the original product. Developers can even include past versions of the product<br>
to facilitate upgrade compatibility and file exchange.
</p>
<p>
Highlighted Data's new electronic version of the <i> Merriam-Webster's Ninth New</i><br>
<i>Collegiate Dictionary</i> would not have been possible without CD-ROM technology. It<br>
features digitally recorded pronunciations of more than 160,000 entry words, as well<br>
as the full text and graphics of the print edition.
</p>
<p>
The <i>Manhole </i> CD-ROM by Mediagenic, the industry's first CD-ROM entertainment<br>
product for the Macintosh, is a great example of an enhanced product. It was developed<br>
from the popular HyperCard-based fantasy adventure. On the CD-ROM, enhanced<br>
graphics and animation combine with original music to bring the characters of this<br>
adventure to life.
</p>
<p>
<b>DISTRIBUTING APPLICATION ENVIRONMENTS</b><br>
Some developers are taking advantage of CD-ROM to produce and distribute "complete"<br>
application environments for business and other uses. The concept behind an<br>
application environment is simple: combine several individual products that<br>
complement each other, in a way that appears seamless to the user. The resulting<br>
savings on packaging and distribution costs can be passed along to users.
</p>
<p>
With the data encryption techniques already available for CD-ROM, you can include<br>
your entire line of software on a single CD-ROM and distribute it with different<br>
decryption keys. When a user decides to add another component, he or&nbsp;&nbsp;she purchases<br>
the key to decrypt another application from the same CD-ROM.
</p>
<p>
To date, the best-known example of an application environment is the Microsoft Office.<br>
Microsoft bundles their four most popular business applications--Word, Excel,<br>
PowerPoint, and Mail--on a CD-ROM with on-line documentation, HyperCard-based<br>
navigational tools, popular templates and clip art, and several third-party<br>
applications that add even more value to the suite of applications. 
</p>
<p>
<b>ENABLING COLLABORATIVE PRODUCTS</b><br>
A related area with a great deal of potential for CD-ROM is cooperative or<br>
collaborative works put together by multiple developers or a publisher and several<br>
developers. The idea is for a publisher or group of developers to combine several<br>
related applications, texts, graphic images, sounds, or animations into a user<br>
environment that the individual developers would not have considered producing, or<br>
could not have produced, individually. This approach can work especially well for<br>
smaller developers who cannot lavish money on product packaging and promotion.<br>
Collaborative works also have a great deal of potential for users, since they get the<br>
combined efforts of several developers who have worked together on a single product. 
</p>
<p>
<b>DISTRIBUTING INFORMATION PRODUCTS</b><br>
Information products are natural candidates for distribution on CD-ROM, as this<br>
technology very easily lends itself to storing immense libraries of information that<br>
can be indexed, cross-referenced, and searched electronically. The data in these<br>
libraries can be text, sound, graphics, animation, or anything else you happen to<br>
fancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple is seriously investigating producing a CD-ROM of its entire technical<br>
library for developers, including the Technical Notes series, <i>Inside Macintosh,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;and<br>
MacApp documentation. The <i>Developer Essentials</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;disc is just the tip of the proverbial<br>
iceberg; see Corey Vian's sidebar for details. OCLC (On-Line Computer Library<br>
Corporation) publishes an entire line of CD-ROMs for use in libraries around the<br>
world. The <i> MacroMind CD-ROM</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;by MacroMind, Inc., includes over 100 megabytes of<br>
VideoWorks and MacroMind Director animations, guided tours, and clip art. These are<br>
all first- generation examples of the use of CD-ROM to distribute information<br>
products.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Developers have just begun to scratch the surface of what is possible when a local<br>
CD-ROM archive is combined with up-to-date on-line data, a combination that offers<br>
users both the storage advantage of CD-ROM and the timeliness that only an on-line<br>
system can offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normally high cost and slow speed of on-line system searching<br>
is negated by the presence of the local CD-ROM archives. The "AppleLink Offline" stack<br>
produced by DTS, currently distributed to Apple Partners and Associates, is a good<br>
prototype of this combination. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Beyond these archives, or knowledgebases, there is also great potential for<br>
combination CD-ROM and on-line applications where large amounts of data could be<br>
stored locally on CD-ROM and the code for interacting with other on-line users and<br>
accessing the data on the CD-ROM could be stored on an on-line system.
</p>
<p>
<b>ENABLING INTERACTIVE MEDIA PRODUCTS</b><br>
Because CD-ROM stores all of its information in digital format, it's an excellent<br>
medium for combining text, graphic images, sound, animation, and any other type of<br>
data for interactive media. The only real limitation is retrieval speed from the disc,<br>
and at 150K per second, CD-ROM is fast enough for just about anything but<br>
uncompressed, full-motion color video.
</p>
<p>
To date the largest uses of interactive media on CD-ROM have involved HyperCard,<br>
which has proven worthy of the task. With HyperCard 2.0, it is even easier to author<br>
stacks that combine sound, color graphics, animation, and related data for use on<br>
CD-ROM; and the new features of HyperCard 2.0 stacks are no longer limited by disk<br>
space.
</p>
<p>
<i>Audio Notes #1: "The Magic Flute," </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;produced by Warner New Media, is an excellent<br>
example of interactive media on CD-ROM. This product, the first in a Music Discovery<br>
series, fills three CD- ROM discs with both HyperCard stacks and&nbsp;&nbsp;CD-ROM audio<br>
content on Mozart's <i> The Magic Flute.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger Englander, the television producer of<br>
Bernstein's Young People's Concerts, provides music commentary to go with the<br>
original German libretto and the English translation. In addition, this CD-ROM set<br>
includes newly recorded sidebars about the music, the symbolism, and opera forms.
</p>
<p>
<i>Ludwig Van Beethoven, Symphony No. 9, </i> another example of interactive media, is a<br>
part of the Voyager CD Companion Series from the Voyager Company. This product by<br>
Robert Winter is a commercially produced audio CD-ROM with accompanying floppy<br>
disks of data and HyperCard stacks. These stacks not only teach the user about<br>
Beethoven and the symphony itself, but also about music theory in general.
</p>
<p>
<b>ENABLING USER INTERACTION IN A LEARNING ENVIRONMENT</b><br>
Imagine a CD-ROM about film that enables you to direct your own scenes with different<br>
camera angles and effects; or a CD-ROM that guides you through the city of your choice<br>
as it looked or will look at a specified time period; or a CD-ROM that gives you the<br>
complete works of French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal in both French<br>
and English (or any other language) with pictures of his surroundings at the time of<br>
his writings; timelines of the major events during his life; excerpts from popular<br>
music, literature, and architecture of the period; and critiques and comments from his<br>
contemporaries.
</p>
<p>
Although it may have the greatest potential for both instructional and general use, the<br>
area of&nbsp;&nbsp;"userviews" is one of the least developed at this time. The idea of a user view is<br>
that the developer provides the user with an environment in which he or she is guided<br>
by interactive tutorials and interpretive simulations through the data, and then<br>
enables the user to build his or her own "views" of the same data. At any time the user<br>
can switch between the different types of available data and the selected view. CD-ROM<br>
is the ideal medium for this type of thing, since it can contain texts, graphic images,<br>
sounds, statistics, timelines, and animations.
</p>
<h2>WHAT NOW?</h2>
<p>
This article has given you a few ideas to get you started thinking about how you can<br>
best benefit from CD-ROM technology, and you can probably think of many more. The<br>
point is that CD-ROM opens a lot of doors and removes a lot of assumed barriers to<br>
product development. This technology offers you a rare opportunity to let your<br>
imagination run wild; however, what you choose to do with it is up to you.
</p>
<h2>MAXIMIZING CD-ROM SPEED</h2>
<p>
If you are writing CD-ROM-based software, there are many steps you can take to<br>
ensure the maximum possible speed from your product.
</p>
<p>
First, organize your files in a way that makes it easy for both the user and the Finder<br>
to work. Avoid burying important files six or seven folders from the root level of the<br>
file system, and conversely, avoid putting 1,000 files into a single folder or at the<br>
root level. Once you have the master hard disk organized, look for opportunities&nbsp;&nbsp;to<br>
precompute and store information to speed up your application. Take advantage of the<br>
660 MB of space at your disposal--it is less expensive than CPU cycles for your<br>
users.
</p>
<p>
Take full advantage of the static nature of CD-ROM; if&nbsp;&nbsp;it helps, use absolute filenames<br>
in your applications&nbsp;&nbsp;or HyperCard stacks if they are to be run only on the disc.<br>
However, note that if you decide to use absolute filenames, you should provide a<br>
mechanism such as a preferences file in the user's Preferences folder to enable users<br>
to change the location of your applications and data. One method for doing this is<br>
hard-coding only default pathnames and prompting the user (saving the resulting<br>
choices to a preferences file) if the files the user needs are not found in the default<br>
locations.
</p>
<p>
The best method for gaining speed on the CD-ROM is to thoroughly test the entire<br>
contents on different machine configurations until you find the optimal configuration.<br>
Then go back and test it again to make sure you have not missed anything. Different<br>
layouts, default memory configurations, and pathnames can produce different results,<br>
especially for HyperCard &#174; stacks. If possible, test the hard disk as a locked volume on<br>
a file server or on a CD-ROM simulator (usually available at your local disc<br>
mastering company); these tests give a more accurate reflection of how the final<br>
CD-ROM should perform than testing on a locally connected hard disk.
</p>
<p>
Finally, before you master the CD-ROM, optimize the hard disk that you will use for<br>
the mastering process. You can either use a third-party optimization program (be<br>
sure to back up your disk first) or even better, copy the entire contents to a freshly<br>
formatted hard disk. This process guarantees that your files are written (and will be<br>
read) contiguously on the disk and also rebuilds the desktop resource file or desktop<br>
database files that the Finder needs. When you finish this process, unmount the hard<br>
disk and use a disk editor to zero the boot blocks on the hard disk. This final process<br>
speeds the time it takes the CD-ROM to mount and also ensures that it is not mistaken<br>
for a boot volume.
</p>
<p>
If you do these things, you will have done everything you can to make your CD-ROM<br>
product as fast as possible.
</p>
<h2>INSIDE AN ELECTRONIC d e v e l o p</h2>
<p>
by Corey Vian, Apple Developer Press
</p>
<p>
Electronic publishing is relatively unexplored territory and so invites both innovation<br>
and disaster. When&nbsp;&nbsp;we decided to take d e v e l o p electronic, we&nbsp;&nbsp;knew we would see a<br>
little of each. Initially we thought that the electronic version should precisely match<br>
the printed version. Our reasons for wanting to maintain parallelism between the<br>
printed and electronic version had to do with spatial orientation and translation<br>
efficiency.
</p>
<p>
Some of us remember the location of the content we have read. We remember that a<br>
reference was on the lower-right portion of a left-hand page near the end&nbsp;&nbsp;of the<br>
magazine, for example. If we read it first in the printed version and later want to find<br>
it in the electronic version, this spatial parallelism makes switching media much<br>
easier.
</p>
<p>
The idea of taking a printed magazine--of any format-- and making a page-by-page<br>
translation into electronic form is attractive in that it generalizes the process of<br>
translation and eliminates some production time by reusing work already done on the<br>
printed version. We imagined that any publication could be translated into electronic<br>
form using a standard, nearly automatic conversion process.
</p>
<p>
<b>How We've Done It. </b>We created the first issue of&nbsp;&nbsp;d e v e l o p by printing<br>
PageMaker documents to&nbsp;&nbsp;glue files, converting the glue files to PICT files, and pasting<br>
them into SuperCard. We ran into numerous problems because the PICT files were<br>
being interpreted differently at each step. Some PICT interpreters make a single<br>
object out of an entire line of text, while others make individual objects out of each<br>
word in an attempt to preserve spacing when fonts are changed. If the original font<br>
used in the PICT is not available, a substitute font is used. We copied the text for each<br>
page into an invisible field in its corresponding card so that when you searched for<br>
text, you were taken to the appropriate card. The drawback was that we could not<br>
highlight the text once found, since it was embedded in the PICT.
</p>
<p>
We explored the possibility of writing XCMDs that would actually search a PICT file<br>
and highlight the found string, which seemed doable but only addressed a small part of<br>
the problem. Neither the process nor product&nbsp;&nbsp;for the first issue were turning out<br>
quite as we had envisioned. It was too slow, it displayed its pages without respect for<br>
the size of the screen it was being viewed on, PICT files were misinterpreted in the<br>
translation process, and the pages were difficult to read overall. After all, they were<br>
designed to be printed at 1200 dpi. Basically, the publication showed no respect for<br>
the medium it was being translated into. So we decided to take a step back and<br>
reevaluate our approach. With deadlines looming, we agreed on a slightly improved<br>
interim remedy and began the process of designing a more elegant, long-term solution.
</p>
<p>
For the second issue, we scrapped the full-page PICT approach. Instead, we copied the<br>
text into SuperCard fields, copied the pictures individually, restyled the text, and then<br>
placed the pictures to approximate the layout of the journal. This was surprisingly<br>
easy and took only a day or two.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also gave us more readable text and the ability to<br>
search and highlight the actual text you were reading. We still included full-page<br>
PICTs elsewhere in the application, used for printing.
</p>
<p>
For the third issue, we have reformatted the previous issues in this same way and<br>
included them all in one file so that all articles are directly accessible from a single<br>
application. We will handle subsequent issues this way until we have worked out a<br>
design that better addresses key problems inherent in electronic publishing.
</p>
<p>
<b>Where We're Headed.</b> As with life, one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;most basic problems associated with<br>
an electronic publication is the unknown. When we distribute a printed publication,<br>
the content, presentation hardware, and interface are all bundled together under our<br>
control. With electronic publications, there are many variables over which we have<br>
little or no control--primarily screen size, resolution, and color limitations, as well<br>
as processing speed. This places severe restrictions on&nbsp;&nbsp;the design process.
</p>
<p>
Should we design for the lowest common denominator and flush innovation down the<br>
toilet? Should we design for the average platform and irritate many subscribers? Or<br>
can we design a presentation that will work well in the various environments and still<br>
let us exploit the extraordinary capabilities of the computer? After all, we could<br>
simply put all the articles up on AppleLink and call it a day. The challenge is to develop<br>
a standardizable framework that will work for users and have a minimal impact on<br>
creative options.
</p>
<p>
Most media have arrived at some consistent format. Some constraints are put in place<br>
to provide context and a familiar, and therefore comfortable, entry into the content,<br>
like the frame around a painting, the form of a musical fugue, or the size of a magazine<br>
as compared, say, to a dictionary. Yet within those constraints, substantial creativity<br>
is possible. A balance can be struck between the need for consistency and the need for<br>
creativity. We are struggling to find this balance in the realm of electronic<br>
publications, but the rich and rapidly changing nature of the medium resists our<br>
efforts. 
</p>
<p>
<b>What We've Learned. </b>We've learned that page- for-page translation is probably<br>
not a good idea. Formatting that is left- or right-handed makes no sense on a screen<br>
that displays a single page at a time--if that. Using scroll bars to push an image<br>
around in&nbsp;&nbsp;order to see the whole thing is at best a work-around. Magazine print is too<br>
small to be viewed at 72 dpi without enlarging. A solution that takes full advantage of,<br>
yet respects the limitations of, the electronic environment will feel far more natural<br>
than trying to dress a print man in a cathode-ray suit.
</p>
<p>
It is a mistake to think of the printed version of&nbsp;&nbsp;d e v e l o p as the basic product to be<br>
recast in an electronic form. d e v e l o p, or any other publication, is not essentially a<br>
collection of printed pages. Rather, it is a specific domain of information, knowledge if<br>
you like, that can be conveyed by a variety of media. Effective use of the electronic<br>
environment demands a fresh look at what publishing can be.
</p>

<b>MARK B. JOHNSON</b> (emphasis on the "B") has been driving people crazy at Apple<br>
and DTS for two years. This Hoosier native came here from Notre Dame, where he<br>
spent three and a half years in the snow, getting for his trouble only a 1986 B.A. in<br>
French and computer applications (a CS/MIS sort of thing) with a concentration in<br>
philosophy. However, he liked the seasons there (and the White Castle hamburgers) so<br>
much that he convinced them to let him stay and slave for another three years doing<br>
Apple support and development in user services. Mark does a lot of the "unofficial"<br>
projects in DTS. He has had a hand in <i> Phil &amp; Dave's Excellent CD TM, SpInside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i> , and the Apple FTP Internet site. He also stays up nights figuring out how to<br>
best hide Technical Note #31.

In his rare moments away from the office, he loves watching Notre Dame beat USC in<br>
football, participating in a variety of sports, collecting&nbsp;&nbsp;French wine, playing in his<br>
recently rediscovered kitchen, and working on and driving fast cars (very useful,<br>
since he is rumored to own a 1975 Bricklin SV-1). Mark claims to be addicted to<br>
adrenaline and electronic mail, but from the 550 (and counting) Coke cans stacked in<br>
his office window, we know what his <i> real</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;addictions are. *
