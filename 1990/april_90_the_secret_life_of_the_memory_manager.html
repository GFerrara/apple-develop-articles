<h2>THE SECRET LIFE OF THE MEMORY MANAGER</h2>
<h1>RICHARD CLARK</h1>
<p>
<i>The Macintosh Memory Manager has changed in some subtle ways since it was</i><br>
<i>documented in Inside Macintosh</i> .<i> This, combined with the difficulty of observing what</i><br>
<i>the Memory Manager actually does, has led to a general misunderstanding of how the</i><br>
<i>Memory Manager works. This article first discusses some common myths about the</i><br>
<i>Memory Manager, then describes some ways to avoid memory-related errors and</i><br>
<i>control fragmentation without sacrificing execution speed.</i>
</p>
<p>
Few parts of the Macintosh operating system raise as many questions as the Memory<br>
Manager. Since the contents of RAM change dynamically, it's hard to really examine the<br>
Memory Manager's behavior. This, combined with the unusual concept of relocatable<br>
blocks and the fact that the Memory Manager is used by most of the operating system,<br>
has left many Macintosh programmers confused about the behavior of the Memory<br>
Manager and, more important, about the impact of this behavior on their applications.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>MYTHS ABOUT THE MEMORY MANAGER</h2>
<p>
Several myths have grown up around the Memory Manager, serving to increase the<br>
confusion about its real behavior. Three of the most prevalent--but mistaken--<br>
beliefs are that (1) the Memory Manager will move and delete blocks, and otherwise<br>
mangle the heap, at random; (2) using nonrelocatable blocks will cause serious heap<br>
fragmentation; and (3) if you use Virtual Memory you don't need to worry about the<br>
Memory Manager. We'll demolish each of these myths in turn.
</p>
<p>
<b>MYTH 1: THE MEMORY MANAGER WILL MOVE AND DELETE BLOCKS,&nbsp;&nbsp;AND</b><br>
<b>OTHERWISE MANGLE THE HEAP, AT RANDOM</b><br>
This simply isn't so. The Memory Manager is in fact quite predictable. It only moves<br>
blocks under these circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
<li> When your application calls a routine that allocates new blocks  or<br>
enlarges existing ones, when you request that blocks be moved, or when your<br>
application calls a routine that in turn calls a ROM routine that may trigger<br>
block relocation. Appendix A of the <i>Inside Macintosh XRef</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;lists all routines <br>
defined in<i> Inside Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;that may cause blocks to move.</li>
<li> When the called routine is in a different segment from the code that<br>
makes the call, or when the called routine is in the same&nbsp;&nbsp;segment as the<br>
caller, but the called routine calls a routine or&nbsp;&nbsp;routines in a different<br>
segment. If a called routine lies in a&nbsp;&nbsp;different code segment, the Segment<br>
Loader may need to call&nbsp;&nbsp;the code segment in from disk and/or move it to the<br>
top of the heap. Either of these actions can cause blocks to move.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>MYTH 2: USING NONRELOCATABLE BLOCKS WILL CAUSE&nbsp;&nbsp;SERIOUS</b><br>
<b>MEMORY FRAGMENTATION</b><br>
This is a half-truth at best. The Memory Manager actually does a good job of allocating<br>
nonrelocat- able blocks, but can fragment the heap when these blocks are deallocated<br>
and new ones allocated. Similar problems can happen when you start locking<br>
relocatable blocks.
</p>
<p>
This myth actually has a basis in reality, as the earliest versions of the Memory<br>
Manager did a poor job of allocating nonrelocatable blocks. Before the 128K ROMs<br>
(introduced with the Macintosh 512Ke and Macintosh Plus), the Memory Manager<br>
would not move a relocatable block around a nonrelocatable block in its quest to<br>
allocate a new nonrelocatable block. This made the heap into a patchwork of relocatable<br>
and nonrelocatable blocks, and caused general fragmentation problems, as illustrated<br>
in Figure 1.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/147.gif" width="533 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 1. Fragmentation of Free Space</b>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;But that has long since changed, as <code>NewPtr</code> will now move a relocatable block around a<br>
nonrelocatable block when allocating memory. This tends to partition the heap into two<br>
active areas, with all of the nonrelocatable blocks at the bottom of the heap, and the<br>
relocatable blocks located immediately above. (See the sidebar "How the Memory<br>
Manager Allocates Heap Space" for further details.)
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;On the other hand, for all of the improvements in allocation of nonrelocatable blocks,<br>
there is still a problem with<i>de</i> allocation of these blocks. Since the Memory Manager<br>
uses a "find the first free block that fulfills the request" strategy (as opposed to "find<br>
a block that fits the request exactly"), if you allocate a subsequent block that is<br>
smaller than the block you just deleted, the heap will become fragmented and the<br>
amount of usable memory will likely decrease, as illustrated in Figure 3. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3. The Effect of Deallocating and Reallocating a Nonrelocatable</b><br>
<b>Block</b>
</p>
<p>
Locking too many relocatable blocks can cause the same kind of fragmentation<br>
problems as deallocating and reallocating nonrelocatable blocks. A well-trained<br>
programmer uses the call<code>MoveHHi</code>to move a relocatable block to the top of the heap<br>
before locking it. This has the effect of partitioning the heap into four areas, as shown<br>
in Figure 4. The idea of using<code>MoveHHi</code> is to keep the contiguous free space as large as<br>
possible. However,<code>MoveHHi</code> will only move a block upward until it meets either a<br>
nonrelocatable block or a locked relocatable block. Unlike<code>NewPtr</code><br>
(and<code>ResrvMem</code>),<code>MoveHHi</code> will not move a relocatable block around one that is not<br>
relocatable. 
</p>
<p>
Even if you succeed in moving a relocatable block to the top of the heap, your problems<br>
are far from over. Unlocking or deleting locked blocks can also cause fragmentation,<br>
unless they are unlocked beginning with the lowest locked block. In the case illustrated<br>
in Figure 4, unlocking and deleting blocks in the middle of the locked area has resulted<br>
in heap fragmentation. The relocatable blocks thus trapped in the middle won't be<br>
moved until the locked block below them is unlocked.

<b>MYTH 3: IF YOU USE VIRTUAL MEMORY, YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY</b><br>
<b>ABOUT THE MEMORY MANAGER</b><br>
Many people believe that the wide availability of Virtual Memory will remove the need<br>
for careful memory management. Wrong! The Virtual Memory system is based on a<br>
series of "pages" of memory that can be swapped to and from the disk, rather than on<br>
individual blocks of memory. If you fragment RAM, you also "fragment" the contents of<br>
the swap file and gain nothing. In fact, Virtual Memory makes careful memory<br>
management even more critical, for two reasons. First, fragmenting the swap file will<br>
degrade system performance worse than fragmenting physical memory will, since disk<br>
access speeds are obviously slower than the RAM access speed. Second, the combination<br>
of Virtual Memory and MultiFinder encourages users to run more programs at the<br>
same time than they used to, and users often reduce the partition sizes of their<br>
applications to squeeze in "one more program."
</p>
<h2>THE EXPERT'S GUIDE TO MEMORY MANAGEMENT</h2>
<p>
Now you know that the Memory Manager moves blocks of memory only at certain<br>
well-defined times; that nonrelocatable blocks can be allocated without causing serious<br>
fragmentation in the heap, although deallocation and reallocation of these blocks, and<br>
locking too many relocatable blocks, can cause problems; and that use of Virtual<br>
Memory makes careful memory management even more important. It's time to put this<br>
knowledge into action. In this section, you'll learn how you can work cooperatively<br>
with the Memory Manager to increase the efficiency and robustness of your<br>
applications.
</p>
<p>
<b>TO AVOID DANGLING POINTERS</b><br>
As every programmer learns early on, the gravest side effect of the Memory Manager's<br>
penchant for moving blocks of memory is the peril of dangling pointers. (For a<br>
refresher on how these come about, see the sidebar entitled "A Primer on Handles and<br>
Their Pitfalls" in Curt Bianchi's article "Using Objects Safely in Object Pascal" in this<br>
issue.) And the best defense against having to spend hours--or days--debugging<br>
errors caused by dangling pointers is to anticipate situations in which block movement<br>
might occur, and if it does occur, will throw a monkey wrench into the works. In these<br>
situations, much grief can be saved by using a temporary local or global variable to<br>
store a duplicate of the relocatable block. (Note, though, that this trick only works<br>
properly if the block can stand on its own--that is, it's not part of a linked list.)
</p>
<p>
Some of the situations that might get you into trouble are well documented, such as the<br>
use of the WITH statement in Pascal. Other dangerous situations are less obvious, so<br>
we'll explore them here.
</p>
<p>
<b>Be careful when evaluating expressions. </b>There are times when evaluating a<br>
seemingly innocent expression might have serious side effects. For example, look at<br>
the following code:
</p>
<pre>TYPE
    windowInfoHdl = ^windowInfoPtr;
    windowInfoPtr = ^windowInfo;
    windowInfo = RECORD
        aControlHdl: ControlHandle;
        aWindowPtr: WindowPtr;
    END;

VAR
    myHandle : windowInfoHdl;

BEGIN
    myHandle := windowInfoHdl(NewHandle(sizeof(windowInfo)));
    { The next 2 statements have problems. }
    myHandle^^.aWindowPtr := GetNewWindow(1000, NIL, WindowPtr(-1));
    myHandle^^.aControlHdl :=
        GetNewControl(1000, myHandle^^.aWindowPtr);
END;</pre>
<p>
In Pascal, the above statements would probably cause a run-time error. The problem<br>
is in the expression "<code> myHandle^^.something :=</code>" as the compiler evaluates<br>
expressions from left to right and calculates the address on the left side of the<br>
assignment statement <i> before </i> making the toolbox call. When <code>GetNewWindow</code> is called,<br>
<code>myHandle^^ </code>is moved (we passed in <code>NII</code> to force a call to <code>NewPtr</code>) <i>and the address on</i><br>
<i>the left- hand side is no longer valid! </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the returned <code>WindowPtr</code>will be<br>
written into the wrong area of memory, and the program will probably crash.
</p>
<p>
While both statements suffer from the same basic problem, the first one is more<br>
likely to cause a crash than the second one and is therefore easier to debug. Why is<br>
this? 
</p>
<p>
The statement containing <code>GetNewWindow</code> will make a call to <code>NewPtr</code> to allocate a<br>
nonrelocatable block at the bottom of the heap, forcing relocatable blocks upward in<br>
the process. The other statement, containing <code>GetNewControl</code>, allocates a relocatable<br>
block, which usually appears above the existing blocks, with block movement<br>
happening only if a compaction is required.
</p>
<p>
While this problem occurs most frequently in Pascal, C programs are not immune.<br>
Most C compilers on the Macintosh evaluate the right- hand side of an assignment<br>
before the left-hand side--which avoids this problem entirely--<i>but the order of</i><br>
<i>evaluation is not guaranteed by the ANSI standard.</i>
</p>
<p>
This problem can be solved easily by using a temporary variable. The following code<br>
avoids the problem:
</p>
<pre>VAR
 myHandle:    windowInfoHdl;
 aWindowPtr:   WindowPtr;        { This is allocated on the }
                                 { stack, so it won't move. }
 aControlHandle: ControlHandle;  { Also on the stack. }

BEGIN
 myHandle := windowInfoHdl(NewHandle(sizeof(windowInfo)));

 { Copy the result into a temporary variable, then copy }
 { that into the relocatable block. }
 aWindowPtr := GetNewWindow(1000, NIL, WindowPtr(-1));
 myHandle^^.aWindowPtr := aWindowPtr;

 aControlHandle := GetNewControl(1000, aWindowPtr);
 myHandle^^.aControlHdl := aControlHandle;
END;</pre>
<p>
<b>Be careful when using callback routines. </b>When you pass pointers to your<br>
routines, say as a ROM callback routine, and your routines are in multiple segments,<br>
you need to be careful.
</p>
<p>
The following code is fine now, but we'll soon edit it to demonstrate the problem:
</p>
<pre>{$S Main }
PROCEDURE MyCallback(ctl: ControlHandle; part: INTEGER);
{ This represents a callback routine used for continuous }
{ tracking in controls. }
BEGIN
 { Do whatever you need to do. }
END;

PROCEDURE HandleMyControl(theControl: ControlHandle;
             pt: Point);
BEGIN
 part := TrackControl(theControl, pt, @MyCallback);
END;</pre>
<p>
The expression <code>@MyCallback</code>pushes the address of the callback routine onto the stack<br>
before calling <code>TrackControl</code>. If the two routines are in the same segment, as in the<br>
preceding example, all is fine. The segment is locked in memory when <code>@MyCallback</code> is<br>
both evaluated and used; therefore, the address is valid. If the two routines are in<br>
different segments, this also works, as the compiler takes the address of the jump<br>
table entry for <code>MyCallback</code>.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, and especially in C, you may choose to set up a table of procedure<br>
addresses. But if you store the address of the routine into a variable, strange things<br>
may happen. Take a look at the following code:
</p>
<pre>{ ----------------------------- }
{ For an example, we'll place the addresses of two control }
{ tracking routines into an array, then use them. }

VAR
 gCallbackArray: ARRAY [1..2] OF ProcPtr;

{ ----------------------------- }
{$S Segment1 }

 PROCEDURE MyVScrollCallback(theControl: ControlHandle;
               part: INTEGER);
 BEGIN
  { This will get called if our control is a vertical }
  { scrollbar. }
 END;


 PROCEDURE MyVScrollCallback(theControl: ControlHandle;
               part: INTEGER);
 BEGIN
  { This will get called if our control is a horizontal }
  { scrollbar. }
 END;

 PROCEDURE InitCallbackArray;
 { Fill in the addresses in the global &#8220;Callback&#8221; array. }
 BEGIN
  { Problem: Since we're in the same segment, these aren't }
  { addresses of the jump table entries, but are absolute }
  { locations in RAM! If the segment moves (i.e., if }
  { UnloadSeg is called), the addresses will be invalid. }
  gCallbackArray[1] := @MyVScrollCallback;
  gCallbackArray[2] := @MyHScrollCallback;
 END;
END.

{ ----------------------------- }
{$S Main }

PROCEDURE HandleAScrollbar(theControl: ControlHandle;
             pt: Point);
{ We'll call this if the user clicks in our scrollbar (except }
{ if she clicks in the thumb, which uses a different kind of }
{ callback.) If it's a vertical scrollbar, use one callback; }
{ if horizontal, use the other. }
VAR
 part:    INTEGER;
 theCallback: ProcPtr;
 isVertical: Boolean;
 aRect:    Rect;
 cntlWidth:  INTEGER;

BEGIN
 aRect := theControl^^.cntrlRect;
 cntlWidth := aRect.right - aRect.left;
 isVertical := cntlWidth = 16;
 IF isVertical THEN
  part := TrackControl(theControl, pt, gCallbackArray[1])
 ELSE
  part := TrackControl(theControl, pt, gCallbackArray[2])
 { The TrackControl calls will probably crash if }
 { Segment1 has been unloaded since the table was built. }
 { You'll have a wonderful time trying to find the bug! }
END;</pre>
<p>
When setting up a table of such procedure addresses, or even a single global variable,<br>
you should do one of the following things: (1) make sure that the setup procedure is in<br>
a different segment from the procedures being called, thus insuring that you get the<br>
address of a jump table entry; (2) keep <i>everything </i> in one segment and never unload<br>
it; or (3) always load the segment and build the table before using any of the addresses<br>
(and make sure that the segment doesn't get unloaded in the meantime).
</p>
<p>
<b>Be careful when passing parameters.</b> Another problem area occurs when you<br>
pass parameters to routines that allocate or move memory. Can you spot the problem<br>
in the following code?
</p>
<pre>PROCEDURE ValidateControl(theControl: ControlHandle);
BEGIN
    ValidRect(theControl^^.contrlRect);
END;</pre>
<p>
<code>ValidRect</code> receives the address of a rectangle, which is pushed onto the stack before<br>
the trap is called. The problem is that before<code>ValidRect</code> uses the rectangle's address,<br>
it often allocates memory of its own, which can cause <code>theControl^^</code> to move and<br>
therefore invalidate the rectangle's address.
</p>
<p>
This problem happens when you pass (1) any parameter larger than four bytes, or <br>
(2) any <code>VAR</code> parameter. Again, the solution requires a temporary variable:
</p>
<pre>PROCEDURE ValidateControl(theControl: ControlHandle);
VAR
    r : Rect; { r is stack-based, so it doesn't move. }
BEGIN
    r := theControl^^.contrlRect;
    ValidRect(r);
END;</pre>
<p>
Pascal compilers often avoid this problem for user-defined functions by making a<br>
local copy of&nbsp;&nbsp;non-<code>VAR</code> parameters that are passed by address. The ROM doesn't make<br>
such a copy, so you need to be careful. This is discussed at length by Scott Knaster in <br>
<i>How to Write Macintosh Software</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2nd ed. (Hayden Books, 1988).
</p>
<p>
<b>TO CONTROL HEAP FRAGMENTATION</b><br>
As you will recall, heap fragmentation can be caused by (1) deallocating and<br>
reallocating nonrelocatable blocks, and (2) locking too many relocatable blocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;To<br>
keep heap fragmentation under control, follow a few simple rules.
</p>
<p>
<b>Use nonrelocatable blocks sparingly. </b>To avoid the potential problems that<br>
deallocation and reallocation of nonrelocatable blocks can cause, you should<br>
theoretically use relocatable blocks for everything. However, in practice, there are<br>
areas where you<i> must</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;use nonrelocatable blocks, such as for<code>GrafPorts</code> and<br>
<code>WindowRecords</code>. In light of this reality, here are three suggestions to help you control<br>
fragmentation.
</p>
<p>
First, remember that you should not choose to use nonrelocatable blocks lightly. Use<br>
them only when the Macintosh operating system requires them, or when you can <br>
<i>demonstrate</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;a severe performance penalty for using relocatable blocks.
</p>
<p>
Second, avoid allocating nonrelocatable blocks unless they will never be deleted. If you<br>
know about such blocks ahead of time, then you can allocate them at program start-up.<br>
This works well if you'll have a single large "image buffer" or the like, or a limit on<br>
the number of available windows. In these cases, allocating your large fixed blocks at<br>
start-up time will avoid potential fragmentation problems.
</p>
<p>
Third, if you must allocate and deallocate nonrelocatable blocks on demand, you can add<br>
some additional memory management code of your own. When you want to deallocate a<br>
block of RAM, you can add it to a linked list of free blocks (that you maintain), and<br>
then check this list for a free block of the exact size you need each time you want to<br>
allocate a new block. Of course, this works best if the range of block sizes you support<br>
is limited, and you still have to decide what to do if the block you want doesn't fit any of<br>
the free blocks exactly. If you have to allocate a large number of nonrelocatable blocks,<br>
or have other special needs, you should consider allocating a large block of memory and<br>
doing your own memory management within that. Donald Knuth's book<i>The Art of</i><br>
<i>Computer Programming,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;volume 2, 2nd ed. (Addison-Wesley, 1973) contains a<br>
useful overview of memory management techniques under the heading "Dynamic<br>
Storage Allocation" (pp. 435-55 and 460-61). 
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Note that this strategy of reusing nonrelocatable blocks works best under the 128K<br>
ROM (and later) Memory Manager, since that version does the best job of allocating<br>
nonrelocatable blocks. If you plan to write software under the 64K ROMs (Macintosh<br>
128K or 512K), you should consult Scott Knaster's <i>How to Write Macintosh Software</i> <br>
, which describes a strategy that does a better job with the old Memory Manager than<br>
this strategy does.
</p>
<p>
<b>Lock selectively and consider alternatives. </b>Fear of dangling pointers often<br>
drives new programmers to lock down everything in sight, quickly fragmenting the<br>
heap and impeding the application's performance. More experienced programmers try<br>
to avoid locking relocatable blocks, preferring instead to predict when the Memory<br>
Manager will move blocks of memory and then only locking a relocatable block if they<br>
must. If done infrequently, locking has a negligible impact on your application.
</p>
<p>
If you must lock a relocatable block, you should unlock it as soon as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will<br>
lessen the probability of another block being moved in underneath (by <code> MoveHHi</code>) and<br>
locked. Also, if you move and lock several blocks together, you should unlock all of<br>
them together, or at least in the reverse of the order in which they were moved high.<br>
This will help ensure that the free area is kept together in the heap.
</p>
<p>
As an alternative to locking relocatable blocks, consider using temporary variables.<br>
We've already seen the use of temporary variables for such small items as window<br>
pointers and rectangles, but this approach can also be used for entire structures.<br>
Using temporary variables can simplify your code by removing the need for <code>HLock</code><br>
and <code>HUnlock</code> calls. For example, many programs use a window's reference constant<br>
(<code>RefCon</code>) field to hold a handle to a data structure. Programs that do so look something<br>
like this:
</p>
<pre>TYPE
 windowInfoHdl = ^windowInfoPtr;
 windowInfoPtr = ^windowInfo;
 windowInfo = RECORD
  rectArray: ARRAY [1..10] OF Rect;
 END;

PROCEDURE UpdateWindow(wp: WindowPtr);
{ The window's RefCon contains a handle to the data structure shown }
{ above. The rectArray field contains an array of rectangles that }
{ we want to draw. }

VAR
 myHandle: windowInfoHdl;
 count:   INTEGER;

BEGIN
 { Get the window information, then lock the block so that it }
 { doesn't move while drawing the rectangles. }
 myHandle := windowInfoHdl(GetWRefCon(wp));
 MoveHHi(Handle(myHandle));
 HLock(Handle(myHandle));

 BeginUpdate(wp);
 FOR count := 1 TO 10 DO
  { Working with the heap-based window information, draw each }
  { rectangle. }
  FrameRect(myHandle^^.rectArray[count]);
 EndUpdate(wp);
 HUnlock(Handle(myHandle));
END;</pre>
<p>
Notice that we had to perform several type casts, and use <code>MoveHHi</code>,<code>HLock</code>, and<br>
<code>HUnlock</code>. Now, let's see how this would look using a temporary variable:
</p>
<pre>{ Type declarations omitted for brevity. }

PROCEDURE GetWindowInfo (wp: WindowPtr; VAR info: windowInfo);
{ Utility routine to make a copy (usually stack-based) of our }
{ window information structure. }
VAR
 myHandle: windowInfoHdl;

BEGIN
 { First, do a little error checking. }
 IF (wp  NIL) THEN BEGIN
  myHandle := windowInfoHdl(GetWRefCon(wp));
  { You can incorporate extra error checking here. For example, }
  { this is a good place to compare the handle&#8217;s size to the }
  { window information structure&#8217;s size, or to verify that the }
  { contents of the block are legal values. }
  {                              }
  { Next, go ahead and copy the contents of the relocatable }
  { block to the specified location. We don&#8217;t have to lock }
  { things down, since BlockMove won&#8217;t cause compaction. }
  BlockMove(Ptr(myHandle^), @info, sizeof(windowInfo));
 END;
END;

PROCEDURE UpdateWindow(wp: WindowPtr);
VAR
 info: windowInfo;  { This storage is on the stack, therefore it }
                    { won&#8217;t move. }


BEGIN
 GetWindowInfo(wp, info);  { Get a copy of the window information. }
 BeginUpdate(wp);
 FOR count := 1 TO 10 DO
  { Working with the stack-based copy of the window information, }
  { draw each rectangle. }
  FrameRect(info.rectArray[count]);
 EndUpdate(wp);
END;</pre>
<p>
This approach has two major advantages: safety and code simplification. If you have one<br>
central routine that gets the window information (and another similar one to set it),<br>
you can add quite a bit of error checking and catch a large number of potential errors.<br>
Speed shouldn't be a problem, as the single <code>BlockMove</code> operation is generally faster<br>
than the corresponding <code> MoveHHi</code> since the latter may need to move an old relocatable<br>
block out of the way first.
</p>
<p>
Of course, you have to be<i>extremely</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;careful when using this technique, as it is easy to<br>
exceed the stack size limit when using recursive or heavily nested procedures. If you<br>
have a series of nested procedures that all use the window information structure, you<br>
can get the structure in the topmost procedure and pass the block down as a<code>VAR</code><br>
parameter (pass-by-address in C) so that an extra copy of the data structure isn't<br>
made. 
</p>
<h2>FINAL WORDS OF ADVICE</h2>
<p>
In this article, we've taken a quick look inside the Memory Manager, but we have not<br>
been able to cover everything. If you want to have a fuller understanding of Macintosh<br>
memory management, there are a few things you can do. First, reread chapter 3 of <br>
<i>Inside Macintosh</i> , volume I, and chapter 1 of <i>Inside Macintosh</i> , volume II. Next, take a<br>
look at Scott Knaster's <i> How to Write Macintosh Software</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;, mentioned earlier, which<br>
has an excellent discussion of memory management. (In fact, I recommend the book<br>
highly to anybody who wants a better understanding of developing and debugging<br>
Macintosh software.) Finally, examine the Memory Manager's behavior in real-life<br>
situations.develop, the disc, contains the source and object code for the Heap Demo<br>
application, which sets up a small heap independent of the main application heap and<br>
allows you to manipulate handles and pointers in that environment. If you do these<br>
things, you'll be well on the way to mastering the Memory Manager.
</p>
<h2>HOW THE MEMORY MANAGER ALLOCATES HEAP SPACE</h2>
<p>
The Memory Manager uses two basic techniques to create space for blocks on the heap:<br>
compaction and reservation. It uses compaction to create space for new relocatable<br>
blocks, and reservation to create space for new nonrelocatable blocks.
</p>
<p>
When your application (or the operating system) calls <code>NewHandle</code> to allocate a new<br>
relocatable block, the Memory Manager first looks for a large enough space to hold a<br>
block of the requested size. If a large enough space is found (and it need not be a perfect<br>
fit), the block is allocated. If there is not enough free space to satisfy the request,<br>
compaction takes place--relocatable blocks are moved downward (toward low<br>
memory) to make space for the new block. As a rule, the Memory Manager allocates<br>
new relocatable blocks as low in the heap as possible without compaction. If the heap<br>
must be compacted, the Memory Manager begins with the lowest blocks and gradually<br>
works its way upward until it has created a large enough free space to accommodate the<br>
new relocatable block or until the entire heap has been compacted.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;On the other hand, when your application (or the operating system) calls <code>NewPtr</code> to<br>
allocate a new nonrelocatable block, the Memory Manager calls <code>ResrvMem</code> to create an<br>
empty space at the bottom of the heap for the new nonrelocatable block. This technique<br>
is&nbsp;&nbsp;known as reservation (after the call), although you won't&nbsp;&nbsp;find this term anywhere<br>
in <i>Inside Macintosh.</i>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The Memory Manager always allocates nonrelocatable blocks as low as possible on the<br>
heap, even if it means that other blocks have to be moved. In the case shown in Figure<br>
2, the Memory Manager has to move a relocatable block twice when the user allocates<br>
two nonrelocatable blocks. Note that each time the 4KB relocatable block is moved, it<br>
leaves a 4KB space behind. This is a result of the way the Memory Manager reserves<br>
memory. It first moves the block upward into the first free area above its former<br>
position large enough to hold it, then uses the old space for the new block.

<p>
&nbsp;In summary, allocating a new nonrelocatable block is likely to move other<br>
(relocatable) blocks upward, while&nbsp;&nbsp;allocating a new relocatable block may cause<br>
compaction, which moves relocatable blocks downward.

<h2>ABOUT LOCAL AND GLOBAL VARIABLES</h2>
<p>
While in this article we're primarily interested in information stored on the heap,<br>
there are actually three places you can store information in memory: in a relocatable<br>
or nonrelocatable block on the heap, in a local variable, or in a global variable. In<br>
terms of storage efficiency, relocatable blocks are your best bet. But if you need to<br>
store information in an area that will not move, you can use local or global variables.
</p>
<p>
Local variables are allocated on the machine's stack, and only exist as long as the<br>
enclosing procedure is running. Global variables are stored in a special block above<br>
the top of the application's stack and heap, and exist as long as the program is running.<br>
Both of these areas share one disadvantage: limited space. You can only allocate 32KB of<br>
global variables, and the maximum available stack space typically varies between 8KB<br>
and 24KB, depending on the machine, the operating system version, and whether or not<br>
the application has requested a larger stack when launched.
