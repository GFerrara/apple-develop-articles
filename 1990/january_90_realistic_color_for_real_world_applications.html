<p>
On the Macintosh, Apple's graphics software (QD) lets a programmer work with a<br>
high-level graphics model that is independent of the physical display device. This gives<br>
Apple the option to take advantage of new features and technologies without requiring<br>
application developers to rewrite their code.
</p>
<p>
32-Bit QuickDraw extends QuickDraw to encompass the full range of displayable<br>
color.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although today's monitors are typically capable of showing a full spectrum of<br>
color or grays, it is the video card and system software of a computer that control the<br>
number of colors or shades of gray on the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;A 1-bit video card allows 2 colors<br>
or shades (typically black and white), 2 bits gives 4, 4 bits gives 16, 8 bits gives<br>
256, and 24 bits gives over 16 million colors. 
</p>
<p>
Color QuickDraw always supported the description of nearly unlimited colors (248)<br>
but constrained images and screens to any 256 of the expressible colors. 32-Bit<br>
QuickDraw significantly increases the standard number of colors available for an<br>
application while maintaining speed and affordability. 
</p>
<p>
32-Bit QuickDraw--which carries 24 bits of color information--consists of three<br>
files:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a General cdev that works more effectively with the system, whether the<br>
other pieces are installed or not</li>
<li>a Monitors cdev extended for 32-bit addressed video cards</li>
<li>a 32-Bit QuickDraw Init file, which contains the new QuickDraw<br>
software</li>
</ul>
<h2>NEW FUNCTIONALITY IN 32-BIT QUICKDRAW</h2>
<p>
This is the laundry list of 32-Bit QuickDraw features.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are listed in relative<br>
order of importance, but some may be more important to you, depending on whether<br>
you've thought about them before.
</p>
<p>
<b>Support for 32-bit-per-pixel graphics</b> The pixel data has 8 bits each in red,<br>
green, and blue and an 8-bit alpha channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only 24 of the 32 bits per pixel are used<br>
by QuickDraw.&nbsp;&nbsp;24 bits per pixel--over 16 million colors--gives you pretty much<br>
the maximum number of colors the eye can distinguish.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the display mode of the<br>
graphics system supports this much color, you don't have to restrict the application or<br>
user to a particular set or palette.
</p>
<p>
<b>Support for 16-bit-per-pixel graphics (1 alpha-5-5-5)</b>The pixel data<br>
has 5 bits each in red, green, and blue and a 1-bit alpha channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;16 bits per pixel--<br>
or over 32,000 colors--is considered by many to be sufficient for high-quality<br>
graphics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because 16 bits per pixel requires less memory than 32 bits per<br>
pixel,displays can use less expensive hardware.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dithering Dithering of 32- and 16-bit images to lower color</b><br>
<b>resolutions</b> --1, 2, 4, and 8 Color dithering is similar to creating a color that looks<br>
like orange by placing red and yellow pixels close together.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the display is limited to<br>
a certain number of colors, the Macintosh can take images rich in color information<br>
and produce a close match at lower color resolutions, giving the appearance of more<br>
color by combining the limited number of colors in an effective manner.
</p>
<p>
<b>Gray-level representation with luminosity</b> In grayscale mode, QuickDraw<br>
will map a color to its nearest luminance value or lightness.&nbsp;&nbsp;This produces superior<br>
images, even with 16 gray levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's hard to imagine how good this can be without<br>
seeing it. so we'll show you just how great it is in these next two pictures
</p>
<p>
<b>An improved Palette Manager</b> The Palette Manager now allows application<br>
developers to have more control over their color environment by improving multiple<br>
monitors support, supporting a highlight color as one of four colors in 2- bit mode,<br>
setting up a true grayscale look-up table on monochrome devices, and restoring the<br>
color environment when an application quits.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Palette Manager also directly<br>
supports color table animation of pixel images in a device-independent manner (see<br>
"All About the Palette Manager" in this issue for details).
</p>
<p>
<b>New offscreen support</b> These new routines can isolate developers from device<br>
dependencies by extending offscreen pixMap support.&nbsp;&nbsp;Developers typically use<br>
offscreen support to buffer drawing for fast, seamless updates to the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Offscreen<br>
imaging is also convenient for custom rendering algorithms that assume a particular<br>
frame buffer configuration--since requiring a particular video display mode is not a<br>
user-friendly solution.
</p>
<p>
<b>Improved graphics performance in all bit modes</b> 32-Bit QuickDraw provides<br>
performance improvements in region-clipped pattern fills and bit blits, such as<br>
updating the desktop pattern or resizing a window.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improved rescaling of images to<br>
smaller sizes When 32-bit-per-pixel images are resized to smaller sizes, pixels are<br>
combined using an averaging technique to yield recognizable thumbnail-sized<br>
images--an important improvement for the postage stamp market.
</p>
<p>
<b>New routine to get regions from bitmaps </b> Getting a bitmap from a region is<br>
easy--just paint the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new routine <code>BitmapToRgn</code> provides the inverse<br>
transformation.
</p>
<p>
<b>Alpha channel movement</b> 32-Bit QuickDraw supports routines that use up to 24<br>
bits of color.&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional 8 bits of information are typically used by application<br>
developers as an alpha channel or transparency mask.&nbsp;&nbsp;QuickDraw now moves the extra<br>
8 bits around without adding functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that alpha channel memory may not<br>
actually be present on the video card. The new Monitors cdev The new cdev improves<br>
the Monitors interface and adds advanced features.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now developers can easily modify<br>
the cdev through astandard programming interface.
</p>
<p>
<b>Support for color PostScript printing</b> Apple's new LaserWriter 6.0 driver<br>
now offers a standard mechanism for printing the high-quality color that 32-Bit<br>
QuickDraw provides.
</p>
<p>
<b>Color Picker changes</b> Most of the changes to the Color Picker are related to the<br>
user interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the former version of the Color Picker, if the where parameter was<br>
set to (0, 0), then the dialog was centered on the main device. For obvious reasons,<br>
this method did not work well if the main device was not a color device.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new<br>
Color Picker, if you want the dialog centered on the best device--that is, the device<br>
with the highest bit depth, regardless of color support--then you must pass (-1, -1)<br>
as the where parameter.
</p>
<p>
<b>Compression for file formats</b> 32-bit and 16-bit data are normally compressed<br>
when they are in PICT files so that storage on disk takes significantly less space than<br>
the original data.
</p>
<p>
<b>Support for very large frame buffers</b> Video cards that require more than 1 MB<br>
of memory, such as a 1280 x 1024 x 8-bit deep card, now work in a standard way<br>
with the system.
</p>
<p>
<b>Changes in rowbyte restrictions</b> 32-Bit QuickDraw relaxes the restriction that<br>
rowbytes be less than $2000.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the new limit of $3FFE may still be a<br>
problem with large pixel maps at 32 bits per pixel.&nbsp;&nbsp;Early releases of the 32-Bit<br>
QuickDraw documentation incorrectly reported that rowbytes had a limit of $8000.
</p>
<p>
<b>Not to mention, as you always expected...</b> 32-Bit QuickDraw has implications<br>
for several familiar aspects of working with the Macintosh.&nbsp;&nbsp;PICT, the Macintosh<br>
graphics resource and file format, has been extended to support 16-bit and 32- bit<br>
data.&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer modes that allow QuickDraw to blend different bitmaps and combine<br>
their colors interactively in different ways have been extended so that they work at,<br>
and between, all bit depths.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because images of any depth can be displayed at any depth,<br>
you have ultimate flexibility to respond to the requirements of the task at hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Colors<br>
are mapped to an appropriate match when increasing or decreasing color depth of the<br>
display.
</p>
<h2>WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT</h2>
<p>
To begin with, you can't use 32-Bit QuickDraw features if you don't know they're<br>
installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;To check for 32-Bit QuickDraw, your application should ensure that Color<br>
QuickDraw is present on the machine by calling <code>SysEnvirons</code>. Then, since 32-Bit<br>
QuickDraw internally uses trap number <code>$AB03</code>, check to see if this trap is available<br>
by comparing its trap address with that of the standard unimplemented trap <code>$A89F</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If<br>
the two are the same, trap <code>$AB03</code> is unavailable, and 32-Bit QuickDraw is not present.<br>
You can use the following MPW C code fragment to test for Color QuickDraw and<br>
32-Bit QuickDraw.&nbsp;&nbsp;If either test fails, tell the user.
</p>
<pre>#define QD32Trap   0xAB03
#define UnImplTrap  0xA89F
#define False 0
#define True 1
PutUpInformativeMessage()
{
     printf("\n 32-Bit QuickDraw is not implemented.");
}

QD32Exists()
{  
    short error;
    Boolean result = False;   /*  Assume not there  */
    SysEnvRec theWorld;
   
    error = SysEnvirons (2, &amp;theWorld);
   
    if (theWorld.hasColorQD)
    result = (NGetTrapAddress (QD32Trap, ToolTrap) !=
           NGetTrapAddress (UnImplTrap, ToolTrap));
          
    return result;
}

main()
{  
    Boolean QD32IsImplemented;

    QD32IsImplemented = QD32Exists();
    if (!QD32IsImplemented)
        PutUpInformativeMessage();
}</pre>
<p>
<b>Direct pixMaps</b> 32-Bit QuickDraw supports two new pixel formats, corresponding<br>
to 32-bit pixels and 16-bit pixels.&nbsp;&nbsp;In each case, the pixel's color is specified by the<br>
pixel value directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pixel value is not an index into a color look-up table.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a<br>
pixMap, this is specified by setting the pixelType field to RGBDirect = 16.
</p>
<p>
Before 32-Bit QuickDraw, when each pixel was a single value representing an index<br>
into a color table, the cmpCount field was always equal to 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;With RGBDirect pixels,<br>
each pixel contains three components, one each for the intensities of red, green, and<br>
blue therefore, cmpCount should be set to 3.
</p>
<pre>pixelType      =   16; {RGBDirect}
pixelSize       =   32; {Must be a power of 2}
cmpCount        =   3;  {Three components: Red, Green, Blue}
cmpSize         =   8;  {8 bits for each component}
pmVersion       =   0;  {Must be set for future compatibility}
pmTable                 {Handle to color table with 1 entry}
    ctSeed          =   24;     {CmpCount * CmpSize}
    ctFlags         =   0;  {No special flags}
    ctSize          =   0;  {Zero based count of entries}
    ctTable         =       {Space for one color spec}

pixelType       =   16; {RGBDirect}
pixelSize       =   16; {Must be a power of 2}
cmpCount        =   3;  {Red, Green, Blue
cmpSize         =   5;  {5 bits for each component}
pmVersion       =   0;  {Must be set for future compatibility}
pmTable                 {Handle to color table with 1 entry}
    ctSeed          =   15; {CmpCount * CmpSize}
    ctFlags         =   0;  {No special flags}
    ctSize          =   0;  {Zero based count of entries}</pre>
<p>
Since the Window Manager, as well as many applications, examines the ctSeed of<br>
screen pixMaps, the pmTable field for a direct device pixel map should always contain<br>
a valid handle with a color table header.&nbsp;&nbsp;For consistency, the ctSeed should be equal to<br>
cmpCount * cmpSize--although you can have the seed equal a unique value.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the seed<br>
value is the same across devices, then window moves will copy an image with CopyBits<br>
otherwise, the Window Manager will generate an update event.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ctFlags and ctSize<br>
values should be set to zero.
</p>
<p>
<b>PixPats</b> In addition to the standard 8 x 8 foreground/background QuickDraw pattern<br>
filling we have all come to know and love, Color QuickDraw supports drawing objects<br>
with tiled pixel images or pixPats (short for pixel patterns). Although pixPats<br>
actually contain a pixMap that is capable of describing a pixel image of any size and<br>
depth, only bit depths 1 through 8 and dimensions that are a power of two are<br>
supported.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since pixPats contain color information, the grafPort's foreground and<br>
background colors are ignored when drawing with pixel patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;Future versions of<br>
Color QuickDraw will support 16- and 32-bit pixel patterns.
</p>
<p>
Color QuickDraw expands a pixPat to the depth of the target device before drawing. <br>
Make sure that enough memory is available for the expanded pattern. The current<br>
32-Bit QuickDraw limits the volume (area times depth) of an expanded pixPat to less<br>
than 64K.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence a 128 x 128 pixPat (16K @ 8 bits deep) will work at 8 bits per<br>
pixel but draw incorrectly when rendered at 32 bits per pixel.&nbsp;&nbsp;A 64 x 128 pixPat<br>
(32K @ 32 bits deep) will work at any depth. Another type of pixPat, the RGB<br>
pattern, is completely described by a single RGB Color.&nbsp;&nbsp;When drawing an object with<br>
an RGB pattern, Color QuickDraw computes an ordered dither matrix that most<br>
accurately represents the RGB Color on each screen it intersects.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since dithering is<br>
not performed on 32-bit- per-pixel devices, there is never any penalty for using<br>
makeRGBPat to approximate a desired color.
</p>
<p>
<b>Drawing in color</b> When an application requests the drawing of one of the 248<br>
expressible colors, Color QuickDraw finds the closest or best color available on<br>
TheGDevice.&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, this is done by the Color Manager routine Color2Index(),<br>
more appropriately called Color2Pixel.&nbsp;&nbsp;On indexed display devices, Color2Index()<br>
uses the device's inverse table to find the best match. For direct devices,<br>
Color2Index() truncates each color component to the cmpSize of the device.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the<br>
destination device's color table only contains shades of gray, Color2Index() matches<br>
the luminance of the requested color to the closest gray on the device.&nbsp;&nbsp;Luminance<br>
mapping gives superior-looking images on grayscale displays. While most of Color<br>
QuickDraw will find the best color regardless of inverse table resolution, CopyBits<br>
from a direct pixMap to an indexed device cannot distinguish between two colors that do<br>
not differ in the high itabRes bits of any component.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the default itabRes<br>
is four and the standard 8-bit color table does not contain any colors that are not<br>
differentiated by the high four bits of each component.&nbsp;&nbsp;Future versions of 32-Bit<br>
QuickDraw may be able to find these "hidden colors" (for more information on hidden<br>
colors, see Inside Macintosh, volume V, page 138).
</p>
<p>
<b>32-bit addressing</b> In 24-bit addressing mode, there are 16 MB of address space, 6<br>
of which are reserved for NuBus slots at only 1 MB per slot.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since most 16- and<br>
32-bit-per-pixel video cards, as well as some very large 8-bit ones, require more<br>
than the 1 MB of address space per slot, the CPU must access these cards in 32-bit<br>
addressing mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;32-Bit QuickDraw performs all drawing operations in 32-bit<br>
addressing mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;The base address of a screen is assumed to be a valid 32-bit address,<br>
while all other pixMap base addresses are treated as 24-bit addresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently,<br>
32-Bit QuickDraw cannot determine whether a nonscreen base address is a valid<br>
32-bit address.&nbsp;&nbsp;When setting up a pixMap, make sure to initialize the pmVersion<br>
field to zero and use StripAddress on dereferenced handles installed as bitmap or<br>
pixMap base addresses.
</p>
<h2>OFFSCREEN GRAPHICS ENVIRONMENTS</h2>
<p>
With Color QuickDraw, pixel images are transferred using data from TheGDevice to<br>
determine the destination color information.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, whenever copying to an<br>
offscreen pixel map with characteristics differing from TheGDevice--usually the<br>
main screen--it is necessary to create an appropriate offscreen GDevice and set it as<br>
the current GDevice before the copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;If an offscreen pixel map is only copied from,<br>
then no offscreen GDevice is needed, since Color QuickDraw obtains the source color<br>
information from the source pixel map. 
</p>
<p>
When creating an offscreen GDevice, setting up the gdPMap properly is not enough. <br>
GDevices associated with direct pixel maps must have a gdType of directType (=2). <br>
Attaching direct pixMaps to indexed devices often yields rather blue results.
</p>
<p>
As many developers have learned, offscreen drawing environments can be used to do<br>
wonderful things.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, you can do window content buffering for snappy<br>
flicker-free updates, or, of more interest to programmers, you can isolate the<br>
application from the current video display mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fastest CopyBits transfers occur<br>
when the source and destination pixMaps have the same depth, color table, and long<br>
word alignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;32-Bit QuickDraw simplifies the programmer's model with a set of<br>
routines for creating and manipulating graphics environments or GWorlds.&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure<br>
future compatibility and developer sanity, use of the new routines is highly<br>
recommended.
</p>
<p>
Using the new routines, text can be antialiased with a clever use of offscreen drawing<br>
environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;When shrinking 32-bit-per-pixel images, 32-Bit QuickDraw uses an<br>
averaging technique that can yield antialiased text.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can do this by first copying the<br>
background image where the text is to be placed to an offscreen 32-bit deep buffer that<br>
is 2 or 4 times bigger than ultimately desired.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, image the text at the same<br>
enlargement into the offscreen buffer. Finally, copy the entire offscreen back to the<br>
desired destination, shrinking down by the scale factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;A scale factor of 2 will<br>
provide 4 levels of blend between the text and the background, and a scale factor of 4<br>
will provide 16 levels of blend.&nbsp;&nbsp;These illustrations show two ways of drawing text the<br>
usual way draws text on top of a given background at the final size. Now 32-Bit<br>
QuickDraw allows for anti-aliasing text to be obtained by first drawing both the<br>
background and the text magnified (4x magnification in the example) and then using<br>
CopyBits to display the result at the desired size. The illustration above shows the<br>
contents of the framed rectangle magnified four times to show the difference in the<br>
resulting text
</p>
<p>
The following sample code in THINK C creates a 32-bit-per-pixel offscreen graphics<br>
environment, draws an exciting bull's eye image into it, and displays it on the screen<br>
using dithering.

<h2>ADVANTAGES OF BITMAPTOREGION</h2>
<p>
BitmapToRegion lets you use most of QuickDraw's region-oriented calls on bitmaps by<br>
converting the bitmaps into regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though this call was previously available<br>
through Software Licensing, BitmapToRegion was added to the 32-Bit QuickDraw<br>
package in the interest of seeing it more widely used.&nbsp;&nbsp;This call is particularly good for<br>
converting bitmaps to regions when you need to clip to a bitmap or drag its outline. <br>
One application is using a bitmap to mask a color image and apply a transfer mode. <br>
This allows you to call the more powerful CopyBits with a region clip instead of<br>
CopyMask with a bitmap clip.&nbsp;&nbsp;A CopyMask operation, for example, would not be<br>
recorded into a picture and does not support transfer modes.
</p>
<p>
An example of a call done with CopyMask would be:
</p>
<pre>CopyMask (srcPixMap, maskBitmap, destPixMap, srcRect, maskRect,
    destRect)</pre>
<p>
Instead, you could use:
</p>
<pre>BitmapToRegion (maskRegion,maskBitmap)
/* Region must have been created previously with NewRgn */
CopyBits (srcPixMap, destPixMap,srcRect,destRect,mode,maskRegion)</pre>
<p>
Another use for BitmapToRegion would be in creating a patterned paint bucket fill for a<br>
bitmap. 
</p>
<pre>BitmapToRegion (maskRegion,myBitmap);
PenPat (myPattern); /* or PenPixPat (mypixPat) */
PaintRegion(maskRegion);</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, to change the color of a bitmap, you could use:
</p>
<pre>BitmapToRegion (maskRegion,myBitmap);
RGBForeColor (mycolor);
PaintRegion(maskRegion);</pre>
<p>
You could drag the outline of a bitmap around by calling:
</p>
<pre>BitmapToRegion (maskRegion,mybitmap);
DragGrayRegion (maskRegion, startPt, etc...);</pre>
<p>
Finally, you could test a mouse point, or whatever, for intersection with a bitmap<br>

<h2>THE 72 DPI PIXMAP BARRIER</h2>
<p>
Actually, there never was a 72 dpi pixMap barrier.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, the proper usage of<br>
pixMap resolution has not been well described.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, applications have accepted<br>
pixMaps of a given number of rows and columns and assumed that they were generated<br>
on 72 dpi devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;These pixMaps were then copied around at a 72 dpi resolution and<br>
printed out at a 72 dpi resolution, leaving the impression that QuickDraw could not<br>
handle pixMaps of different densities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The advent of frame grabbers and scanners<br>
renders this method of pixMap handling obsolete.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, many pixMaps have a higher<br>
resolution than 72 dpi.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, a user expects such a pixMap to display an<br>
approximation of the information on a 72 dpi display, but print on a<br>
higher-resolution device to the best of its ability. 
</p>
<p>
When recording pictures that contain pixMaps, make sure to set the hRes and vRes<br>
fields of the pixMap record to the native resolution of the image.&nbsp;&nbsp;When importing<br>
pictures, obtain pixMap information from the StdBits bottleneck procedure, not by<br>
imaging the picture into its picFrame.
</p>
<h2>CUSTOM COLOR SEARCH PROCEDURES</h2>
<p>
The following 32-Bit QuickDraw lore describes the May '89 release and is subject to<br>
change in future 32-Bit QuickDraw versions.
</p>
<p>
When pixel images are transferred to a different depth, the destination color<br>
information is obtained from TheGDevice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Custom Color Search Procedures, or Search<br>
Procs for short, associated with a GDevice provide a mechanism for customizing<br>
QuickDraw's color matching algorithms.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the source image is 32 or 16 bits per<br>
pixel, 32-Bit QuickDraw calls the Search Proc associated with the destination GDevice<br>
for each source pixel.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 32-Bit QuickDraw always accesses direct pixel maps in<br>
32-bit addressing mode, and since direct pixMap image translation is performed at<br>
draw time, don't be surprised if your custom Color Search Procedure gets called in<br>
32-bit addressing mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;Color Search Procedures should call StripAddress on<br>
dereferenced handles and SwapMMUMode if toolbox access such as Color2Index is<br>
required (for more information on 32-bit addressing and SwapMMUMode, see Inside<br>
Macintosh, volume V, page 592).
</p>
<p>
Also, for direct pixel source images, the application's global pointer in register A5<br>
may not be valid on entry to custom Color Search Procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your Color Search<br>
Procedure accesses global data structures referenced from register A5 (including<br>
thePort), it must first save and later restore the A5 contents (see Technical Notes<br>
#180 and #208). 
</p>
<p>
In the current version of 32-Bit QuickDraw, custom Color Search Procedures are<br>
ignored when transferring 32-bit or 16-bit images to a device of identical<br>
depth--this is subject to change in future releases.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since dithering techniques need to<br>
accurately maintain colorspace distance, 32-Bit QuickDraw refuses to dither direct<br>
pixMaps when a custom Search Procedure is present.&nbsp;&nbsp;A printer- driver developer<br>
should not rely on this functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent a picture from dithering, intercept<br>
the StdBits bottleneck routine, and remap the transfer mode to srcCopy.
</p>
<p>
<b>CopyBits error codes</b> QuickDraw uses stack space for work buffers.&nbsp;&nbsp;For complex<br>
operations such as depth conversion, dithering, or image resizing, stack space may not<br>
be enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such situations, Color QuickDraw simply skips the operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this<br>
case, 32-Bit QuickDraw will request temporary memory from MultiFinder.&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is<br>
still not enough, or if MultiFinder is not present, 32-Bit QuickDraw returns
</p>
<pre>   QDErr = -149 /* Insufficient stack */</pre>
<p>
This value can be obtained by calling QDError(), which will reset QDErr to zero. One<br>
recourse for the application is to divide the operation--for example, divide the image<br>
into left and right halves--and try again.
</p>
<p>
<b>Region creation error codes</b> While recording drawing operations into an open<br>
region, it is possible that the resulting region description will overflow the current<br>
64K limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should this happen, 32-Bit QuickDraw will return
</p>
<pre>    #define rgnOverflowErr -147 /* Region overflow */</pre>
<p>
Since the resulting region is potentially corrupt, closeRgn will return an empty<br>
region if it detects QDErr has been set to -147.
</p>
<p>
32-Bit QuickDraw's offscreen bitmaps, luminosity mapping, and advanced dithering<br>
automatically do work that would have required sophisticated and lengthy code from a<br>
developer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Palette Manager unloads much of the color management burden<br>
from your application.&nbsp;&nbsp;When all this is combined with the ability to display such<br>
broad ranges of color, we can see that 32-Bit QuickDraw represents a tremendous<br>
programming effort.

<b>At the time </b>of this writing, 32-Bit QuickDraw was installable as a set of files that<br>
could be dragged into the latest system folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;32-Bit QuickDraw will be integrated<br>
into Apple's System 7.0. *
