<h2>SOMEWHERE IN QUICKTIME</h2>
<h2>DERIVED MEDIA HANDLERS</h2>
<h1>JOHN WANG</h1>

</p>
<p>
In this column, I'll be telling you about derived media handlers in QuickTime 1.5 --<br>
but first, some background.
</p>
<p>
QuickTime movies contain tracks that refer to media. In QuickTime 1.0, two media<br>
types are supported: video and sound. A movie might therefore have one track that<br>
refers to video media and one that refers to sound media. Each of these supported media<br>
has a media handler, which is code that's responsible for interpreting the media's data.<br>
Obviously, displaying video images requires different code than playing sound. The<br>
media handler code is in the form of a component of type 'mhlr'. The video media<br>
handler has the subtype 'vide', and the sound media handler has the subtype 'soun'.
</p>
<p>
QuickTime uses the concept of a media to separate media interpretation from the Movie<br>
Toolbox and to place the responsibility into individual media handlers. This has the<br>
added advantage that media handlers can be created to interpret new media types.<br>
However, it wasn't possible to easily create a media handler in QuickTime 1.0. 
</p>
<p>
<b>DERIVED HANDLERS TO THE RESCUE</b><br>
Derived media handler support was introduced in QuickTime 1.5 to allow developers to<br>
define new custom media types. As an example of the capabilities of the derived media<br>
handler, QuickTime 1.5 has a new 'text' media type that's implemented using a derived<br>
media handler. Derived media handler components can easily be created because they<br>
can use the services of a common base media handler supplied by Apple; hence the<br>
name<i>derived media handler.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>The base media handler manages most of the duties that<br>
must be performed by all media handlers and reduces the intricacies of writing a<br>
standalone media handler. 
</p>
<p>
This column will discuss sample code (provided on this issue's CD) that implements a<br>
complete QuickDraw derived media handler. This media handler will interpret<br>
QuickDraw pictures stored in the media's data. Each media sample in the data is a<br>
QuickDraw picture. For example, you could have a movie of a bouncing ball, but<br>
instead of having compressed pixel images of the balls bouncing, as in a video media,<br>
you would have a series of pictures of a ball drawn with PaintOval as it moves along its<br>
path. The CD also contains a sample that creates interesting movies using our new<br>
QuickDraw media type. 
</p>
<p>
<b>CREATING THE COMPONENT SHELL</b><br>
The first step in creating our sample derived media handler is to create a component<br>
shell to which we can add media handler-specific calls in a later step. The<br>
MyComponent.c file contains the following routines: main (the dispatch routine for the<br>
component), MyOpen, MyClose, MyCanDo, MyVersion, and MyRegister. MyOpen, the<br>
initialization routine for our component, opens the base&nbsp;&nbsp;media handler and sends<br>
a<i>target request</i> to it. A target request is a Component Manager service that allows a<br>
new component instance to establish itself as a<i>target</i> component instance for another<br>
(<i>delegate</i>) instance. In our case, the target is our QuickDraw derived media handler<br>
and the delegate is the base media handler. The delegate will be called by the target<br>
whenever the target wants to delegate calls to it. The delegate should call the target<br>
whenever the delegate would normally call itself (for example, when it uses its own<br>
services). This effectively makes our derived media handler sit on top of the base<br>
media handler by handling all requests that it can handle and delegating requests that it<br>
can't handle to the base media handler.
</p>
<p>
By calling the ComponentSetTarget routine after opening an instance of the base media<br>
handler component, we inform the base media handler that our component is derived<br>
from it. For example, the following code from our derived media handler component's<br>
open routine, MyOpen, will open the base media handler and target it:
</p>
<p>
<code>myComp = OpenDefaultComponent(MediaHandlerType, BaseMediaType);</code><br>
<code>ComponentSetTarget(myComp, self);</code><br>
<code>(**storage).delegate = myComp;</code>
</p>
<p>
The above description of targeting a component is similar to another Component<br>
Manager service, called<i> capturing</i>. Capturing is a service whereby the target<br>
component completely and permanently overrides the delegate component by hiding it<br>
from further use. This is feasible, for example, when updating a component or fixing<br>
bugs in it; the target can implement only the new features while delegating the original<br>
functionality to its delegate. Since the target wouldn't want the outdated delegate<br>
component to be visible any longer, it would capture the delegate using the Component<br>
Manager's CaptureComponent routine. You shouldn't call CaptureComponent on the base<br>
media handler, because that would hide it and prevent other derived media handlers<br>
from using it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conceptually, you're not replacing the base media handler; you're just<br>
using its services. Therefore, targeting it is sufficient. 
</p>
<p>
When the media handler is no longer used by the Movie Toolbox, the QuickDraw derived<br>
media handler's MyClose routine will be called. To close the connection to the base<br>
media handler, MyClose must call CloseComponent to close the base media handler<br>
component instance:
</p>
<p>
<code>CloseComponent((**storage).delegate);</code>
</p>
<p>
To prevent our derived media handler from registering if the base media handler isn't<br>
available, the MyRegister routine returns true (to not register) if the initialization<br>
done by MyOpen fails or false (to register) if it succeeds.
</p>
<p>
<b>DEFINING THE MEDIA DATA FORMAT</b><br>
The next step in creating a derived media handler is to define a media type identifier, a<br>
sample description record that's stored along with the media samples, and the format<br>
of the media data.
</p>
<p>
For our QuickDraw media, we'll use 'Qdrw' as the media type. (As with resource types,<br>
Apple reserves all-lowercase types, so we use a media type that contains one<br>
uppercase character.) Every movie that contains a track created by using<br>
NewTrackMedia with mediaType 'Qdrw' will automatically refer to our custom media<br>
handler. Our media handler will have the component type 'mhlr' and subtype 'Qdrw'. 
</p>
<p>
All description records must contain size, type, resvd1, resvd2, and dataRefIndex<br>
fields as a minimum.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should always fill in the size and type fields, but you can set<br>
the other fields to 0. It's also recommended that a field for the media data version be<br>
included in the sample description record so that it's always possible to identify the<br>
version of the media data.
</p>
<p>
<code>#define QDrawMediaType&nbsp;&nbsp;'Qdrw'</code><br>
<code>#define QDMediaVersion&nbsp;&nbsp;0x100</code><br>
<code>typedef struct GraphicsDescription {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;size;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;&nbsp;QDrawMediaType</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resvd1;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resvd2;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dataRefIndex;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;version;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;&nbsp;QDMediaVersion</code><br>
<code>} QDrawDescription, *QDrawDescriptionPtr,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**QDrawDescriptionHandle;</code>
</p>
<p>
Since every media data sample has an associated description record, it's possible to<br>
find out the version, or any other data defined in the record, for the particular sample.<br>
To prevent wasting space with duplicate description records, QuickTime associates a<br>
sample description index with each sample; thus, many media samples can refer to the<br>
same description record through its index.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, the samples stored in our media data are simply QuickDraw<br>
pictures. So the data handle passed to AddMediaSample, which is the Movie Toolbox call<br>
to add data into a media, will simply be a PicHandle. This allows us to easily create<br>
sample data with OpenPicture and ClosePicture and dispose of it with KillPicture. 
</p>
<p>
<b>CREATING A MOVIE THAT USES THE DERIVED MEDIA HANDLER</b><br>
When we start writing the implementation-specific component routines for the media<br>
handler, we'd like to be able to test them with a QuickTime movie that uses that media<br>
handler. So, the next step is to write an application that creates a movie using the<br>
QuickDraw media handler. But there's a sort of Catch-22: We won't be able to run the<br>
application to create the movie until after we begin implementing some of the<br>
QuickDraw media handler component routines, because some of the Movie Toolbox calls<br>
that are used to create the movie will use the QuickDraw media handler. For example,<br>
NewTrackMedia will cause QuickTime to open an instance of our component to prepare<br>
for editing and playback of the new media. 
</p>
<p>
The code below shows how to create a movie using our newly defined QuickDraw media<br>
format (the complete code is on this issue's CD). AddGraphics, defined later, is a<br>
wrapper procedure for AddMediaSample that any application can call to easily add<br>
media samples. 
</p>
<p>
<code>// Create track and media.</code><br>
<code>myTrack = NewMovieTrack(myMovie,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(long) kFrameWidth << 16,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(long) kFrameHeight << 16, 0);</code><br>
<code>myMedia = NewTrackMedia(myTrack, QDrawMediaType,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;600, nil, (OSType) nil);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br>
<code>// Add samples to media.</code><br>
<code>BeginMediaEdits(myMedia);</code><br>
<code>myQDDesc = (QDrawDescriptionHandle)</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NewHandleClear(sizeof(QDrawDescription));</code><br>
<code>(**myQDDesc).size = sizeof(QDrawDescription);</code><br>
<code>(**myQDDesc).type = QDrawMediaType;</code><br>
<code>(**myQDDesc).version = QDMediaVersion;</code><br>
<code>myPict = OpenPicture(&amp;drawRect);</code><br>
<code>PaintOval(&amp;drawRect);</code><br>
<code>ClosePicture();</code><br>
<code>AddGraphics(myMedia, myPict, myQDDesc, 600, 0,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nil);</code><br>
<code>DrawPicture(myPict, &amp;drawRect);</code><br>
<code>KillPicture(myPict);</code><br>
<code>EndMediaEdits(myMedia);</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>// Place media into movie.</code><br>
<code>InsertMediaIntoTrack(myTrack, 0, 0,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetMediaDuration(myMedia), kFix1);</code>
</p>
<p>
The main difference between code that generates a movie using normal QuickTime video<br>
media and code that uses our QuickDraw media is in the NewTrackMedia and<br>
AddMediaSample calls. For NewTrackMedia, we pass 'Qdrw', as defined earlier, for the<br>
mediaType parameter. 
</p>
<p>
The wrapper procedure AddGraphics is defined as follows:
</p>
<p>
<code>pascal OSErr AddGraphics(Media graphicsMedia,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PicHandle myPic,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QDrawDescriptionHandle QDDesc,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TimeValue duration,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short mySync;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TimeValue *sampleTime)</code><br>
<code>{</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return (AddMediaSample(graphicsMedia,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Handle) myPic, 0L, GetHandleSize(myPic),</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duration, (SampleDescriptionHandle)</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QDDesc, 1L, mySync, sampleTime));</code><br>
<code>}</code>
</p>
<p>
<b>ADDING THE MEDIA HANDLER ROUTINES</b><br>
The last step is, of course, to complete our derived media handler component.
</p>
<p>
The file named MyMediaComponentRoutines.c contains the routines that our QuickDraw<br>
media handler implements rather than delegating to the base media handler. It wouldn't<br>
make much sense to delegate MediaInitialize and MediaIdle, since these routines are<br>
crucial to our code: MediaInitialize initializes our media handler and MediaIdle is the<br>
routine that gets called for drawing. On the other hand, a call such as MediaGSetVolume<br>
wouldn't be very useful to our very quiet graphics media, so MediaGSetVolume would<br>
be delegated to the base media handler.
</p>
<p>
All media handler routines, as defined in the Derived Media Handler Components<br>
chapter, must be delegated to the base media handler if not implemented. We've chosen<br>
to implement the following routines because our media handler does spatial processing<br>
(in other words, it draws).
</p>
<ul>
<li>MediaInitialize: Prepares access to media by saving necessary<br>
information passed to it in the GetMovieCompleteParams record. </li>
<li>MediaIdle: The Movie Toolbox provides processing time to the derived<br>
media handler through this routine. The QuickDraw media handler draws<br>
during this call. </li>
<li>MediaSetActive: The Movie Toolbox calls this routine if the media is<br>
enabled or disabled. </li>
<li>MediaSetRate: Called if the rate changes. This is necessary to determine<br>
when the movie rate is reversed. </li>
<li>MediaSetMediaTimeScale: Our media handler cares about the media time<br>
scale since we store times in the media's time coordinate system. </li>
<li>MediaTrackEdited: Called if the track has been edited. If so, we'll want to<br>
redraw. </li>
<li>MediaSetGWorld: Called if the destination GWorld changes. If so, we'll<br>
want to know the new GWorld for drawing. </li>
<li>MediaSetDimensions: Called if the spatial dimensions change. </li>
<li>MediaSetMatrix: Called if the track matrix or movie matrix changes due<br>
to movie resizing. </li>
<li>MediaGetTrackOpaque: Called to determine whether the track is opaque.<br>
We want to return true so that correct compositing occurs. Our media may be<br>
semitransparent. </li>
<li>MediaSampleDescriptionChanged: Called if the sample description record<br>
changes. If we ever store information beyond the media data version, we'll<br>
probably want to know if the user changes the sample description contents. If<br>
the description record changes due to different media samples referring to<br>
different description records, this routine isn't called. Instead, the media<br>
handler must check the sample description index returned by GetMediaSample.</li>
</ul>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The routines we didn't implement are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>MediaGGetStatus: Our simplified QuickDraw media handler doesn't need<br>
any error processing. </li>
<li>MediaPutMediaInfo, MediaGetMediaInfo: Since we don't store any<br>
proprietary information along with the media data, we don't need to implement<br>
this. </li>
<li>MediaSetMovieTimeScale: Our media handler doesn't care about the movie<br>
time scale since we don't store any times in the movie's time coordinate<br>
system. </li>
<li>MediaSetClip: Our media handler doesn't support clipping. </li>
<li>MediaSetGraphicsMode, MediaGetGraphicsMode: Our media handler doesn't<br>
support graphics modes.</li>
<li>MediaGetNextBoundsChange: Our bounds doesn't change dynamically. (The<br>
text media handler is an example of a media that has dynamically changing<br>
bounds.)</li>
<li>MediaGetSrcRgn: Our media doesn't have an irregular display region. </li>
<li>MediaGSetVolume, MediaSetSoundBalance, MediaGetSoundBalance: We<br>
don't play sound. </li>
<li>MediaPreroll: We let the base media handler do our prerolling for us. The<br>
data handler is smart about caching, so we really don't need to worry about<br>
this. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Since it's difficult for us to cover every possible condition in which the media handler<br>
will get called, a clever approach is needed to aid in the development of the derived<br>
media handler. The solution lies in DebugStr: By strategically placing DebugStr calls<br>
throughout the media handler, we can see which routines are being called. Knowing<br>
which events trigger calls to our media handler will allow us to decide which calls the<br>
handler should support and which ones we can delegate. For example, it was through<br>
this process that I found that MediaSetMatrix was a call I needed to implement because<br>
resizing a movie window causes MediaSetMatrix to be called. 
</p>
<p>
This approach makes it possible to create a media handler starting off with just a<br>
MediaInitialize routine and building from there. The selectors for a media handler<br>
component are in the range of 0x500 to 0x5FF. Therefore, any calls that are delegated<br>
with selectors in this range should be examined to determine whether the actions that<br>
cause the routine to be called are significant to the media handler implementation. If<br>
so, the routine should not be delegated. The QuickTime documentation, this column, the<br>
sample code, and common sense should give you a good idea of which media<br>
handler-specific routines a derived media handler must implement. 
</p>
<p>
<b>THE GUTS OF THE MATTER</b><br>
As you can see in MyMediaComponentRoutines.c, most of the guts are in the routines<br>
MediaInitialize and MediaIdle. MediaInitialize is called by the Movie Toolbox when a<br>
movie using the media is opened. The MediaInitialize routine should grab information<br>
it needs that's passed to it by QuickTime in the GetMovieCompleteParams record and<br>
store it in a private data structure. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The above private data structure for the QuickDraw derived media handler shows the<br>
fields that the handler is interested in. For example, we would obviously need to know<br>
the trackMovieMatrix, but a sound media handler would not. The information in the<br>
GetMovieCompleteParams record is valid at the time of the MediaInitialize call and is<br>
updated through other derived media handler routines such as MediaSetGWorld. It's<br>
important to implement such derived media handler routines to update information<br>
used by the media handler.
</p>
<p>
MediaInitialize also needs to inform the base media handler of its capabilities by<br>
calling the routine MediaSetHandlerCapabilities. Our media handler uses this routine<br>
to tell the base media handler that we perform spatial processing and that we also can<br>
work with transfer modes. 
</p>
<p>
MediaIdle does the bulk of the processing in a media handler. Our MediaIdle routine<br>
uses GetMediaSample to get the media sample and then calls DrawPicture to display the<br>
sample. It also uses a scheme of calling GetMediaNextInterestingTime to implement<br>
sync frames; this allows greater performance when playing movies backward, because<br>
the media handler won't have to begin drawing from the beginning of the media. The<br>
concept of sync frames is important in QuickTime movies because it allows temporal<br>
compression so that not all frames need to contain complete state information. Keeping<br>
a small number of frames between key frames makes it possible to preserve<br>
performance when playing movies backward, since rendering of frames must still<br>
occur in the forward direction.
</p>
<p>
The effect of not having sync frames is evident if you create a movie without any (see<br>
the example on the CD). Such a movie will look to the media handler like a movie in<br>
which every frame is a key frame. As you can see with these movies, backward<br>
playback of movies gives different results than forward playback since each sample is<br>
treated as a sync sample even though it shouldn't be. This is not recommended because<br>
it's conceptually and visually confusing to users. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, to prevent the redrawing of previously drawn frames, our media handler<br>
keeps track of the last media time that the image has been updated so that it can<br>
continue from there if no other changes to the environment prevent it. This works only<br>
when the movie is playing in the forwarddirection. When a movie is played backward,<br>
each frame must be completely recreated starting from the last key frame. 
</p>
<p>
<b>OUT OF TIME</b><br>
Using the QuickDraw derived media handler as a framework, you can create your own<br>
media type.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interactivity tracks, custom sound format tracks (such as MIDI), and<br>
even hardware control tracks are all possible. With some creativity and work, you can<br>
expand the capabilities of QuickTime beyond imaginable limits.

<b>JOHN WANG </b>(AppleLink WANG.JY) of Apple's Printing, Imaging, and Graphics group<br>
was once a math and science nerd whose writing skills were as bad as the BASIC<br>
programming language compared to C. His hard work (hah) and prep school training<br>
finally pulled him through. Yet he still can't believe he's writing to an audience<br>
greater than just himself. (The editors can't either.) He's even got a double feature in<br>
this issue (see also "Print Hints"). Will wonders never cease.*
