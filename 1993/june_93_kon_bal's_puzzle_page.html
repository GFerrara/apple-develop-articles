<p>
KON I'm trying out this new C compiler to see what we can do to make the system and<br>
Finder smaller and faster.
</p>
<p>
BAL Wait. Since when has the Finder been written in C?
</p>
<p>
KON It's better than that! It's actually C++, with some assembly routines so that we<br>
can claim the copyright goes back to 1983.
</p>
<p>
BAL Oh, that explains how the System 7 Finder got so much bigger. I thought it was<br>
just the About box. I'm running System 6 on my PowerBook 100. I'd sure like to get a<br>
smaller and faster version of System 7. Are you making any progress?
</p>
<p>
KON Well, yes and no. The compiler output is certainly smaller but I haven't nailed<br>
down how much faster it is. When I boot up and the Finder launches, the machine<br>
restarts, which relaunches the Finder, which causes the machine to restart, and so on.<br>
It all happens pretty fast but doesn't seem all that useful.
</p>
<p>
BAL What machine is this on?
</p>
<p>
KON Macintosh Classic -- the original, not the Macintosh Classic II.
</p>
<p>
BAL Somehow the compiler is generating bogus code that causes the system to restart.<br>
So I compare the code from the new compiler to the code from the old compiler, look at<br>
the differences, and see if they make sense.
</p>
<p>
KON Everything's different: 42,000 bytes went away and the rest is totally different.<br>
This isn't a minor compiler revision. We're talking <i> Advanced Technology</i> here. Where<br>
are you going to look?
</p>
<p>
BAL OK, OK. Let's debug it. I set an ATB on _Launch and then another on _InitGraf.
</p>
<p>
KON OK. You break at _Launch and then after you Go you break at _InitGraf.
</p>
<p>
BAL I set an ATB on _WaitNextEvent.
</p>
<p>
KON You break at _WaitNextEvent.
</p>
<p>
BAL I say Go and see if I get back to _WaitNextEvent again.
</p>
<p>
<b>100</b> KON The machine reboots almost immediately.
</p>
<p>
BAL I go back to the same place and instead of saying Go I trace over<br>
_WaitNextEvent.
</p>
<p>
<b>95</b> KON The machine crashes into MicroBug. But it's not your ordinary crash into<br>
MicroBug. The screen is trashed and you can't type anything. But it looks as though<br>
MicroBug is trying to come up.
</p>
<p>
BAL Can I hit the NMI button?
</p>
<p>
<b>90</b> KON You can press it all you want, but it doesn't do anything. And, by the way, G -1<br>
doesn't work either.
</p>
<p>
BAL Hmmm. It seems as if something is seriously wrong with _WaitNextEvent. Did you<br>
recompile the Process Manager, any DAs, or other stuff?
</p>
<p>
<b>85</b> KON Nope, I only recompiled the Finder. When I get that working, I'll get around to<br>
the rest.
</p>
<p>
BAL So you didn't recompile the Finder extensions? Since the C++ virtual function<br>
tables are different, all your existing Finder extensions are incompatible and maybe<br>
that's what's hosing you.
</p>
<p>
<b>80</b> KON None of the extensions are active, and even if they were, the Finder verifies<br>
their versions. What do you expect? They're object oriented. Of course it works.
</p>
<p>
BAL Of course. Well, since we couldn't make it across _WaitNextEvent, let's step into<br>
it.
</p>
<p>
<b>75</b> KON As soon as you step, you get the same weird crash into MicroBug.
</p>
<p>
BAL I just step into it?
</p>
<p>
KON Yes.
</p>
<p>
BAL As soon as I step, pending interrupts come in and kill me. So I disable interrupts<br>
with an SR = 27000000 and try stepping again.
</p>
<p>
<b>70</b> KON Same crash.
</p>
<p>
BAL Seems like there might be something wrong with MacsBug.
</p>
<p>
KON Let me make sure I'm following you here. Only the Finder is recompiled and you<br>
blame the strange crashes on MacsBug? I'm going to have trouble selling that one.
</p>
<p>
BAL Clearly there's something wrong with the recompiled Finder. It's probably<br>
trashing MacsBug memory.
</p>
<p>
<b>65</b> KON Come on. MacsBug does some sort of a checksum on itself and tells you if it's<br>
been altered. When you break at _WaitNextEvent, you don't get any messages to that<br>
effect.
</p>
<p>
BAL You got me there, KON. So you're saying that MacsBug is in perfect working order<br>
at this point. I can do an IL or whatever, but if I step I'm dead?
</p>
<p>
KON Perfect working order? Same as it ever was. But the Surgeon General has<br>
determined that stepping or tracing at this point causes ill effects.
</p>
<p>
BAL This is not my beautiful MacsBug. If I trace after I hit _InitGraf, is everything<br>
fine?
</p>
<p>
<b>60</b> KON No problem.
</p>
<p>
BAL So I do an
</p>
<p>
<code>ATB ';t ;g'</code>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;which breaks on every trap, traces over it, and then continues. That way I can see<br>
what the last trap I hit was.
</p>
<p>
<b>55</b> KON The machine runs for a while, but when you crash and burn into MicroBug,<br>
you lose your MacsBug screen.
</p>
<p>
BAL Fine. I set up another screen, put MacsBug on that screen using the Monitors<br>
control panel, and use the SWAP command so that MacsBug is always visible. That way<br>
when I crash I can see what just happened.
</p>
<p>
KON Great strategy for a modular Macintosh, but this is on a Macintosh Classic. I'd let<br>
you figure it out that way except you used up your whole budget flying to North Dakota<br>
a few puzzles ago.
</p>
<p>
BAL I was hoping you'd forget that. OK, fine. Someone must be trashing low memory, so<br>
I'll use Bo3b Johnson's totally awesome Blat dcmd. It'll catch any read or write from<br>
memory locations $0-$100.
</p>
<p>
<b>50</b> KON You're on a Macintosh Classic, which doesn't have an MMU. That dcmd works<br>
via the MMU.
</p>
<p>
BAL KON! Those correspondence classes are finally paying off. So I'll narrow down the<br>
area that's causing the problem by doing an ATB 10 to skip over 16 ($10) traps at a<br>
time until the machine crashes into MicroBug. If it takes five times to crash, the next<br>
time I'll do an&nbsp;&nbsp;ATB 40, and then an ATB 4, until it crashes. After I do this enough<br>
times I'll know what was the last trap that was successfully executed, and I can go from<br>
there.
</p>
<p>
<b>45</b> KON Rather than crashing, the machine is now rebooting.
</p>
<p>
BAL OK, so what's the last trap called before the machine reboots?
</p>
<p>
<b>40</b> KON _WaitNextEvent.
</p>
<p>
BAL Fabulous. D&#233;j&#224; vu. Is this a Never Ending Story? And when I'm at _WaitNextEvent<br>
I can't step or trace or anything?
</p>
<p>
KON Well, you can't step or trace. That's all you've tried so far.
</p>
<p>
BAL So I set a breakpoint on the first instruction of _WaitNextEvent and say Go.
</p>
<p>
<b>35</b> KON You crash into MicroBug, just like before.
</p>
<p>
BAL OK, what's the current score? Can we call it quits?
</p>
<p>
KON I wouldn't say you aced this one. Luckily we're getting paid per word, so let's keep<br>
going.
</p>
<p>
BAL But when I was at _InitGraf, I could trace. So something's hosing MacsBug between<br>
_InitGraf and _WaitNextEvent. I'll do the ATB 10 trick like before, but this time I'll<br>
try tracing after every break. That way I can figure out where MacsBug is getting<br>
mauled.
</p>
<p>
<b>30</b> KON You figure out that you can trace over a call to _InitWindows, but when you<br>
trace over the next trap, a call to _GetResource, you crash into MicroBug.
</p>
<p>
BAL So I go to _InitWindows and trace until I get to the call to _GetResource. If it's a<br>
long way, I do a T 1000. If that crashes, I reboot and do a T 500, then a T 250, and so<br>
on, until I find the offending instruction.
</p>
<p>
<b>25</b> KON The offending instruction is a
</p>
<p>
<code>MOVE.L d0,20(a2)</code>
</p>
<p>
BAL What's in A2?
</p>
<p>
<b>20</b> KON $100.
</p>
<p>
BAL Writing to low memory like this sounds like a bad idea. My guess is that A2 is<br>
trashed and we're pounding an important vector. What's at $120?
</p>
<p>
<b>15</b> KON That's MacJmp.
</p>
<p>
BAL Aha! MacJmp is the vector that exception code uses to go to the debugger. Once you<br>
trash that, all bets are off.
</p>
<p>
KON Yeah, setting ATBs works because MacsBug patches the trap dispatcher and looks<br>
for the A-traps you have breaks on. If it encounters one, it just drops into MacsBug<br>
directly. Other breakpoints are set by replacing the existing instruction with a trap<br>
instruction. When these instructions are processed, they go through MacJmp. When<br>
MacJmp gets trashed, tracing and stepping and setting breakpoints no longer works, as<br>
we found out.
</p>
<p>
BAL Nasty.
</p>
<p>
KON Don't try to finish up so fast! You still haven't figured out why the machine is<br>
rebooting.
</p>
<p>
BAL The new compiler must do a better job of register allocation and actually use them<br>
all in its optimizations. Some Finder glue routine you called must have trashed A2.
</p>
<p>
KON Exactly. An easy problem to fix, though. The Finder was calling an assembly<br>
routine that hammered A2. After you fix the bug and build a new Finder, the machine<br>
still restarts.
</p>
<p>
BAL So I set an ATB on _WaitNextEvent, since that was as far as we got last time, and<br>
try to trace over it.
</p>
<p>
<b>10</b> KON OK. No problem.
</p>
<p>
BAL Whew! Finally I get past that _WaitNextEvent. Let's go for two. I say Go and see if<br>
we hit _WaitNextEvent again.
</p>
<p>
KON Nope. The machine restarts.
</p>
<p>
BAL After the first _WaitNextEvent I do the trick with T 1000, T 500,&nbsp;&nbsp;T 250, and so<br>
on, until I find the offending instruction or subroutine. If the problem is occurring in<br>
a subroutine, I go into it and do the same thing. At some point this process has to stop<br>
and I'll find the problem instruction.
</p>
<p>
<b>5</b> KON The offending instruction is an
</p>
<p>
<code>LEA 13(a7),a7</code>
</p>
<p>
BAL Well, that's bogus. Using an odd address on a 68000 will cause an address error.
</p>
<p>
KON Yeah, but the machine is rebooting.
</p>
<p>
BAL I get it. It's an odd address in the stack pointer. The Macintosh gets an address<br>
error because of the odd address. When it goes to process the exception, the exception<br>
handler gets an address error trying to push the exception frame onto the stack. If the<br>
Macintosh ran in user mode, it wouldn't have this problem, since it could switch to<br>
supervisor mode -- essentially a clean machine with a properly aligned stack pointer<br>
-- to handle the exception. But since it runs in supervisor mode, hosing the stack<br>
pointer messes the machine up to the point where it can't even handle an exception, so<br>
it reboots.
</p>
<p>
KON Yeah. We were working on cleaning up the stack after function calls in the<br>
compiler and had a small problem with the way Booleans are handled. Since a Boolean<br>
is only a char, which is one byte, the compiler thought it needed to clean up an odd<br>
amount of space from the stack. Once we explained to the compiler that stacks must be<br>
word aligned, the problem went away.
</p>
<p>
BAL Two bugs in one Puzzle Page!
</p>
<p>
KON Nasty.
</p>
<p>
BAL Yeah.

the latest in networked Spaceward Ho! technology. On his lunch hour, KON debugged<br>
Clinton's economic plan and found the memory leak that was causing that $50 billion<br>
Medicare shortfall. BAL is now working on an audio-animatronic Silicon Valley<br>
executive so that the President can always have one at his side.*
