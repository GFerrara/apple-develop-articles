<i>Dear Tao,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I'm nearing the end of my rope and have become desperate enough that I figure even a</i><br>
<i>letter to you couldn't hurt. Over the last couple of years I've found myself working</i><br>
<i>longer and longer hours. I pointed this out to my boss and she said that there's no way</i><br>
<i>the company could afford to hire more people, and that I was going to have to learn how</i><br>
<i>to "work smarter." Just what the heck is that supposed to mean?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.O.</i>
</p>
<p>
Dear P.,
</p>
<p>
In order to work smarter you have to do two things: first figure out who is smarter<br>
than you, and then copy their actions and claim them as your own. This is a problem<br>
that's easily solved if you look at history. 
</p>
<p>
Unless your name is Stephen Hawking, it's pretty safe to say that Albert Einstein was<br>
smarter than you. Let's see how he handled a similar situation. 
</p>
<p>
Early in his career Mr. Einstein was working in a patent office, but he was having<br>
trouble keeping up with the ever increasing workload. Upon asking his boss for advice,<br>
he too was told to "work smarter." He was also advised that he'd be a little more<br>
presentable around the office if he wore a hairnet while he slept. 
</p>
<p>
Very disturbed, he went home and contemplated these words. The story is told that<br>
after several hours of soul searching and a couple of Fuzzy Navels he was able to get in<br>
touch with his Inner Physicist Self: he quit his job, came up with the General Theory<br>
of Relativity, and as a result started a career as a professional smart guy. 
</p>
<p>
Taking the cue from Al, I'd say the answer's simple: quit your job and never go back to<br>
anything even remotely related to it. True, it's not likely that you'll win the Nobel<br>
Prize for physics, but I'm certain that at the very least you'll find it much easier to<br>
balance your checkbook (a task that is quite a bit simpler when you don't have to<br>
worry about income). 
</p>
<p>
As for wearing the hairnet, I'd say that's optional. On the off-chance youdobecome<br>
famous, you won't look nearly as cool when they make a poster of you if your hair is<br>
neat and tidy -- something always worth considering in any situation. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Dear Tao,I keep a pet hamster at work, and the guy across the hall has a rat. We're</i><br>
<i>thinking of getting one of those cages that link together so that our pets can visit each</i><br>
<i>other, but before we do I have a question: would it be possible for them to have babies?</i><br>
<i>I think it'd be really cool and break up the monotony of the day. </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sign me,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Dr. Doverylittle</i>
</p>
<p>
Dear Doctor,
</p>
<p>
It sounds like you may have not been paying very close attention to your biology<br>
classes for, say, your last ten years of school. The short answer is no, you can't<br>
cross-breed rats and hamsters. However, you'll get a brief but downright eye-opening<br>
demonstration of what food chains are all about if you decide to take the leap and give<br>
your pets a formal social introduction. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking of rodents, it's worth noting that they can be of tremendous help in your<br>
company's advertising efforts. Let's say you have a list of possible slogans to use but<br>
are unsure which is best.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply tape all the slogans you're considering on the side of<br>
your rodent tank and then watch carefully. The one your little beast walks toward will<br>
be the natural winner. Remember, advertising works on the most primitive portions<br>
of the brain, so a rat is as good as an ad exec for the task, and you get the added benefit<br>
of Purina Rat Chow being quite a bit cheaper than the cost of a two- martini lunch. 
</p>
<p>
Can't even come up with a slogan? No problem. You can use single words just as easily<br>
and then string them together. It might take a few trials until you get something that<br>
makes sense, but keep at it. I tried this using random words cut out of the newspaper<br>
and came up with the ultra-highbrow "Price last, anybody's near Russia." It's got<br>
everything you need: concern for the customerandfaux concern for other countries.<br>
Even today I'll bet you could sell a few Lisas using that heady doublespeak. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Dear Tao,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I had a conversation with my boss the other day in which he accused me of "gross</i><br>
<i>incompetence" merely because I was personally responsible for the failure of our</i><br>
<i>company's last three products. I could use your advice on how to proceed. </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Spud Boy</i>
</p>
<p>
Dear Spud,
</p>
<p>
If what you said is true, your boss is right: you are incompetent. Don't let that bother<br>
you; competency is only one of several factors related to your job, and in some ways<br>
your future has never looked brighter. However, you should take action if you're<br>
interested in staying where you are. 
</p>
<p>
The key here is to slyly change your company's employment guidelines. In the 1990s<br>
nearly all businesses of any size have a bylaw that says something like, "Sproutbud<br>
Software has a policy of equal opportunity hiring and we will not discriminate with<br>
regard to an employee's ethnic origin, religious beliefs, age, sex, sexual preference,<br>
marital status, or even if they wear brown shoes with a blue suit."
</p>
<p>
Obviously the phrase that you want added is ". . . will not discriminate with regard to<br>
ability," but that's going to be hard to get on the first pass. What you'll need to do is get<br>
very militant about something that seems relatively trivial. The next time you have a<br>
large meeting, hint that you have reason to believe that your company discriminates<br>
against people who like sherbet. Once they deny it (as they undoubtedly will), say "OK,<br>
maybe you're right, but I won't be comfortable until our employment guidelines are<br>
changed to reflect this." Next, insist there is discrimination against people who like<br>
the color magenta; then, those with a penchant for keeping more than a dollar's worth<br>
of change in their pockets. Eventually people will get so sick of you that they'll just<br>
say "Yeah, whatever! Just fill out whatever you like. Anything to get you to shut up!"
</p>
<p>
Be careful. Once you have this power you'll feel like flaunting it by saying something<br>
like ". . . will not discriminate against people whose last names end in y." It sounds<br>
catchy, but it's a sure tip-off to your plans.

TAO JONES, in a high school English class assignment years ago, was asked to describe<br>
his ultimate fantasy. Although the exact details are now forgotten, it had something to<br>
do with huge castles, large bicycle tracks, and "The Gong Show." When he discovered<br>
that the rest of the class had described things like "a long weekend with Farrah<br>
Fawcett," he immediately started working on an all-encompassing philosophy to<br>
explain the rest of humanity. It's taken years to perfect, and today this philosophy is<br>
commonly referred to as his "bad attitude." *Tao Index: Do not trust those who have<br>
