<h2>LETTERS</h2>
<b>NEW CD &amp; PACKAGING: GOOD</b><br>
I just received develop Issue 14 in the mail (a little late, but worth the wait!). As<br>
usual, the articles are enlightening and entertaining. The Bookmark CD is an excellent<br>
idea as well (although the former student in me doesn't like the idea of missing out on<br>
system software). I enjoyed opening up the journal to find my CD in a case that could<br>
not be broken, even by the worst of mailmen! And, as always, the CD contains a great<br>
wealth of information. I would even go so far as to say I'd pay more than the price of a<br>
yearly subscription with or without the CD; it's really worth it! So, I'd like to<br>
congratulate you and everyone else on the&nbsp;&nbsp;develop staff (as well as all the<br>
contributors) for creating an amazing journal for me (and I guess other developers!)<br>
every three months.<br>
<p>
Keep up the good work, as I look forward to future issues. (I just renewed my<br>
subscription.)<br>

<i>Thanks for the good words about&nbsp;&nbsp;develop and especially about its CD. We've received a</i><br>
<i>number of letters from developers who are less than thrilled about our recent changes</i><br>
<i>(see below). It's wonderful to hear from a happy subscriber.</i><br>

<b>NEW CD: BAD</b><br>
I subscribed to develop after reading the MacWeek article that pointed out what a good<br>
deal it was, especially with respect to the Developer CD Series. APDA told me on the<br>
phone that my subscription would start in a few weeks, and promptly debited by VISA<br>
account. After a few weeks had gone by, I phoned ADPA to ask why I hadn't received<br>
anything. I was told that they had been swamped with orders as a result of the <br>
MacWeek article.
</p>
<p>
Now I find out that there's been a "change" to&nbsp;&nbsp;develop's CD. What bothers me is the<br>
apparent motivation behind all this. You knew that you were swamped with orders,<br>
which were generated by a specific MacWeek article. What did this article say?<br>
Simply that readers should subscribe to&nbsp;&nbsp;develop to get the system software. So what<br>
did you do? Take away the software! Didn't it occur to anyone making this decision that<br>
loyal customers might be angered?
</p>
<p>
I, for one, am not a happy camper.<br>
--Ken Ribet
</p>
<p>
<i>Regarding the CD change: We basically took only Inside Macintosh and system software</i><br>
<i>off the CD. We have since restored Inside Macintosh; that decision was made a bit</i><br>
<i>hastily. But I think the decision to discontinue essentially giving away the system</i><br>
<i>software was a sound one. We're making every effort to give developers the best</i><br>
<i>support possible, but compromises are sometimes necessary.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The decision not to supply the system software on the CD accompanying&nbsp;&nbsp;develop was</i><br>
<i>made independently of the MacWeek column and before it appeared. The timing was</i><br>
<i>unfortunate, but it's not easy, or particularly practical, to reverse company decisions</i><br>
<i>based on what MacWeek chooses to publish. (I hope you don't really think the column</i><br>
<i>motivated us to remove the software from the CD!) We informed the MacWeek</i><br>
<i>columnist immediately of what was about to happen, and he let his readers know. It did</i><br>
<i>occur to us that developers subscribing in response to that column might be angry. But</i><br>
<i>most of them turned out to be happy to receivedevelop and all it does have on its CD for</i><br>
<i>$30 a year. The majority of our subscribers have been understanding about the CD</i><br>
<i>change, saying it always did seem like too good a deal to be true.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I'm always sorry to hear from an unhappy camper. But thanks for writing.</i><br>

<b>NEW CD PACKAGING: SO-SO</b><br>
Your new packaging for the Bookmark CD sent with&nbsp;&nbsp;develop Issue 14 shows an<br>
appreciated effort for environmentally conscious packaging.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this packaging is not U.S. Postal Service-friendly. I was able to flatten<br>
the CD enough so that it's working fine. Using a stiffer mailer and including the words<br>
"DO NOT BEND" clearly visible for the mail carrier would help prevent the CD from<br>
being damaged.
</p>
<p>
develop has been a great assistance to my business. I look forward to each and every<br>
issue.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your assistance.<br>
--Edward Salm
</p>
<p>
<i>Sorry about your delivery problem. We've had a couple of other complaints about this,</i><br>
<i>though not enough to justify the expense of implementing a solution like the one you</i><br>
<i>suggest. We'll keep your words (and the unsuspecting mail carrier) in mind as we</i><br>
<i>continue searching for packaging options that work without increasing the price of a </i><br>
<i>develop subscription.</i><br>

<b>WHITHER THE DOGCOW?</b><br>
I can't fight it anymore; I have to ask. In the Letters column in&nbsp;&nbsp;develop Issue 10, you<br>
say the story of the dogcow is hidden in Tech Note #31 on the CD. I found Tech Note<br>
#31; it was funny, but contains no references to "dog" or "cow" or "Moof!" What<br>
gives? I need to know the story of the dogcow!!!!<br>
--Gary Robinson
</p>
<p>
<i>The Tech Note you saw is actually #31A, "GestaltWaitNextEvent," which indeed is not</i><br>
<i>on the subject of dogcattle. The original Tech Note #31, "The Dogcow," is no longer</i><br>
<i>available, but I can give you some clues on where you might find a copy. It used to be</i><br>
<i>hidden in the Technical Notes Stack on the early versions of develop's CD (most notably</i><br>
<i>"Phil and Dave's Excellent CD"), although no one here seems to be exactly certain when</i><br>
<i>it stopped. It appeared on paper only once, as part of the monthly mailing to Apple</i><br>
<i>Associates and Partners back in April of 1989. Assuming you're not that far behind on</i><br>
<i>reading your mail, you may want to try trolling the net. Macintosh programmers are</i><br>
<i>an unusual breed, and I'm sure you'll find someone who has a copy.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Why the continued secrecy? The answer has a little bit to do with history and a lot to</i><br>
<i>do with tradition, and may or may not have to do with an exchange of spies during the</i><br>
<i>Cold War. But there's good news: your letter has inspired me to write up how the</i><br>
<i>dogcow furor and Tech Note originated -- Apple cultural minutiae that may be of</i><br>
<i>interest to other crazed Macintosh developers. The editor threatens to publish it in a</i><br>
<i>future issue, assuming it passes by our censors.</i><br>
<i>--Mark ("The Red") Harlan Author, Tech Note #31</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>DO THE WRITE THING</b><br>
