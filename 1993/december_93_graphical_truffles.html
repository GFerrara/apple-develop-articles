During the past two years alone, the Developer Support Center has answered more<br>
than 1000 QuickDraw-related questions. The answers to most of these questions are<br>
now available in Apple's plentiful "one-to-many" sources of support for developers,<br>
including<i>Inside Macintosh </i>, Technical Notes, Q&amp;As, sample code, and of coursedevelop.<br>
But you might find it helpful to look here first if you're having a QuickDraw problem.<br>
The symptoms of some common problems are listed in this column along with Dr.<br>
John's suggested remedies. 
</p>
<p>
These are the symptoms that we'll suggest remedies for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>CopyBits is too slow. </li>
<li>You have a palette created with a tolerance of 0, but the colors in your<br>
graphics port don't match the palette. </li>
<li>You're using palettes stored in 'pltt' resources and they don't seem to have<br>
any effect. </li>
<li>Strange colors get drawn when you do a CopyBits between different<br>
graphics ports. </li>
<li>The pen pattern isn't being used when PaintRect is called with hilite<br>
penmode. </li>
<li>NewGWorld doesn't return an error and the GWorldPtr it returns is<br>
unchanged. </li>
<li>QuickDraw routines aren't working on your GWorld. </li>
<li>Your complement procedure isn't being called for InvertRect. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>THE REMEDIES</b>
</p>
<p>
<b><i>CopyBits is too slow.</i></b><br>
<i>Remedy: </i>There's little doubt that CopyBits is a complex piece of code, so there aremany<br>
factors that can affect its execution speed. In fact, there's a long Technical Note<br>
dedicated to this topic, called "Of Time and Space and _CopyBits" (QuickDraw 21). But<br>
here are a couple of quick hints for possible ways to speed up CopyBits:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If your source and destination graphics ports have matching color tables,<br>
set the ctSeed field in the color tables of the source and destination to be the<br>
same. This removes the overhead of comparing the entries in the color tables<br>
to determine whether color mapping is necessary. </li>
<li>Use GWorlds when copying the entire off-screen buffer to the screen.<br>
GWorlds will properly align your pixel data so that CopyBits calls don't<br>
require byte and bit shifting. (You must create the GWorld with a depth of 0<br>
and pass the rectangle in global coordinates.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><i>You have a palette created with a tolerance of 0, but the colors in your</i></b><br>
<b><i>graphics port don't match the palette.</i></b><br>
<i>Remedy: </i>The colors in the graphics port may appear to be different, but remember<br>
that only the high eight bits of an RGB color component are important. The lower eight<br>
bits aren't significant because they're ignored by the hardware. Consequently, for<br>
optimization and implementation reasons, NewPalette creates a palette of colors by<br>
copying the high byte of each color in the input color table to both the high byte and the<br>
low byte of the palette. For example, if the color table has the color ($ff00, $75fe,<br>
$0080), the equivalent palette entry would be ($ffff, $7575, $0000). 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>You're using palettes stored in 'pltt' resources and they don't seem to</i></b><br>
<b><i>have any effect.</i></b><br>
<i>Remedy: </i>You're having this problem because GetNewPalette doesn't work as documented<br>
inInside MacintoshVolume VI. The description of this routine in Volume VI states that a<br>
palette will be loaded and attached to the current window, and if the palette requested<br>
isn't available, the default application palette is used instead. The actual<br>
implementation of GetNewPalette is much simpler: it only loads the specified 'pltt'<br>
resource with GetResource and detaches it with DetachResource to make it a handle; if<br>
the specified 'pltt' resource isn't found, GetNewPalette doesn't load the default<br>
application palette. 
</p>
<p>
Strange colors get drawn when you do a CopyBits between different graphics ports. <br>
Remedy:More than likely, your graphics port and device are incorrectly set. The<br>
current port and device must always be set to the destination port and device. So if<br>
you're copying from a window to an off-screen GWorld, you must call SetGWorld to set<br>
the GWorld as the current port and device.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you do a CopyBits from a GWorld to a<br>
window, you must set the port to the window and the graphics device to the<br>
MainGDevice. This rule actually applies to all QuickDraw drawing. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>The pen pattern isn't being used when PaintRect is called with hilite</i></b><br>
<b><i>penmode.</i></b><br>
<i>Remedy: </i>A bug in QuickDraw causes the pen pattern to be ignored when used with hilite<br>
penmode in the following calls:
</p>
<ul>
<li>FrameRect, PaintRect, and FillRect</li>
<li>LineTo (vertical and horizontal lines only)</li>
<li>FrameRgn, PaintRgn, and FillRgn (rectangular regions only)</li>
<li>FramePoly, PaintPoly, and FillPoly (rectangular polygons only)</li>
</ul>
<p>
A simple workaround for PaintRect is to call PaintRoundRect instead; that is, call
</p>
<p>
<code>PaintRoundRect(&amp;myRect, 0, 0);</code>
</p>
<p>
rather than
</p>
<p>
<code>PaintRect(&amp;myRect);</code>
</p>
<p>
<b><i>NewGWorld doesn't return an error and the GWorldPtr it returns is</i></b><br>
<b><i>unchanged.</i></b><br>
<i>Remedy: </i>The cause of this problem is typically memory movement. Many<br>
object-oriented languages, such as MacApp, store data in handles. If the GWorldPtr<br>
pointer variable you pass to NewGWorld is stored in a relocatable block of memory,<br>
and if that block moves during execution of NewGWorld, NewGWorld will store the<br>
GWorldPtr in the old dereferenced storage location. Instead, pass a local GWorldPtr to<br>
NewGWorld and copy the local GWorldPtr to the relocatable memory block afterward. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>QuickDraw routines aren't working on your GWorld.</i></b><br>
<i>Remedy: </i>Although some routines in QuickDraw will work when LockPixels isn't called,<br>
most routines will have unexpected results. Always call LockPixels if you want to<br>
access or draw into your GWorld.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent memory fragmentation, the GWorld<br>
image should be unlocked when you're not accessing the pixel data so that it can move<br>
in memory. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Your complement procedure isn't being called for InvertRect.</i></b><br>
<i>Remedy: </i>Complement procedures are called from InvertColor only. All other Invert<br>
calls simply invert bits, as in QuickDraw's original design. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NEED A REAL DOCTOR?</b><br>
The next time a QuickDraw problem is giving you a headache, look here first for help.<br>
Dr. John's list of remedies may provide just what you need to solve your problem. If<br>
you don't find a solution here, check as usual in <i>Inside Macintosh </i>and the many other<br>
available sources of help.

JOHN WANG (AppleLink WANG.JY) of Apple's Developer Support Center has a new<br>
addition to his family, named Pepper. The four-month-old baby girl weighs in at a<br>
healthy nine pounds. She has big brown eyes, baby teeth, and a generous amount of<br>
hair. She sleeps all day and makes almost no noise at night. And she's nearly toilet<br>
trained already! Pepper even gets along well with her older brother Skate; they like to<br>
nibble playfully on each other's ears. But when it comes to food, they're fearless; they<br>
fight, kick, and howl -- all for just a bone. *
