<i>One of the many design problems a component developer may face is how to register</i><br>
<i>interdependent components in a predetermined fashion so that any given component is</i><br>
<i>registered before the components that depend on it. This article and the sample code</i><br>
<i>that accompanies it show you how to do just that.</i>
</p>
<p>
The Component Manager is an effective mechanism for providing extended functionality<br>
to the Macintosh platform. Although a single component can perform impressive tasks,<br>
often it's a hierarchy of components, cooperating with one another, that provides the<br>
most powerful capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of such a hierarchy is found in QuickTime<br>
movie playback using the movie controller component (see Figure 1). This component<br>
uses the services of many other components, all of which cooperate together, to make<br>
interaction with QuickTime movies very simple yet very powerful. 
</p>
<p>
There are distinct advantages to partitioning functionality in this manner. First, by<br>
creating components that perform simpler processing, you increase the likelihood that<br>
you can leverage the investment you've made in your code by using it in more than one<br>
place. Second, it's easier to debug smaller components than a gigantic<br>
everything-and-the-kitchen-sink component. Finally, a component that provides<br>
very elementary functionality is easier to override or update (via component<br>
replacement or capture) than a large, complex component. 
</p>
<p>
This situation -- a component depending on the presence of several lower-level<br>
components to perform its function -- is very commonplace. In such cases, it's<br>
important to take steps to ensure that supporting components are available when your<br>
component needs them. There are two obvious choices for when to go looking for the<br>
components you depend on: when your component is being registered (in its register<br>
routine), or when your component is first opened (in its open routine). Most<br>
software-dependent components don't need to worry much about managing component<br>
registration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally such a component should just auto-register, and then check<br>
for any required components in the open routine; if the required components aren't<br>
available, your open routine can return an error. The caller of your component can<br>
then handle the error in whatever way is most appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a case, however,<br>
where checking at registration time might be necessary; that's what this article is<br>
about.

<h2>DO I REALLY NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THIS?</h2>
<p>
One potential problem occurs in situations where the Component Manager's<br>
registration list is used to build some user interface element, such as a pop-up menu<br>
or a list. In this case, the general assumption is that because a component's name is<br>
displayed in a user interface element, a user can select it and it will do whatever it's<br>
supposed to do -- after all, if the component couldn't perform its function, it wouldn't<br>
be displayed as an option for the user, right? Well, that depends. 
</p>
<p>
Let's look at an example. The SuperOps company builds the WhizBang video digitizer<br>
card and supplies two software components with it -- the WhizBang video digitizer<br>
component and the WhizBang sequence-grabber panel component (which is used to<br>
control features specific to the WhizBang hardware). The component files are named<br>
WhizBang Video Digitizer and WhizBang Panel. In its register routine, the WhizBang<br>
video digitizer component checks for its hardware and registers with the Component<br>
Manager only if the hardware is present (this is normal behavior for components that<br>
encapsulate hardware functionality). The WhizBang sequence-grabber panel<br>
component checks for the availability of the WhizBang video digitizer component when<br>
it receives either an open message or a "panel can run" message -- it doesn't get a<br>
register message, and therefore it always registers successfully with the Component<br>
Manager. 
</p>
<p>
Now let's say I've got a Macintosh Quadra 950 with multiple sound and video digitizers<br>
installed (I can dream, can't I?), one of which is the WhizBang card. I remove the<br>
WhizBang card from my computer, but I leave the two WhizBang components installed.<br>
I then start up my Macintosh Quadra and run my favorite movie capture application. I<br>
display the sequence-grabber video settings dialog box, and I see a dimmed item in the<br>
panel pop-up menu -- "WhizBang panel." The dimmed name indicates one of two<br>
things: another application has the WhizBang video digitizer open, so it's not available,<br>
or the WhizBang video digitizer component isn't registered at all, so the panel can't<br>
run. 
</p>
<p>
In this case, we already know that the WhizBang card isn't installed, so there's no way<br>
this panel can<i>ever</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be enabled, given the current hardware configuration. Rather than<br>
confuse users by displaying the panel name in the pop-up menu (even if it is<br>
dimmed), it would be nicer if it weren't displayed atall.&nbsp;&nbsp;To do that, we need to ensure<br>
the following order of events at startup: the video digitizer component must attempt to<br>
register first, and then the panel component must attempt to register (this implies<br>
that the panel component must implement a register routine), checking for the<br>
presence of the video digitizer component before it does so. Further, this sequence of<br>
events must not be influenced by the alphabetic order of the component filenames.<br>
Guess what? We can realize this goal by managing component registration. 
</p>
<p>
This article and the sample code on this issue's CD demonstrate various ways of<br>
managing component registration. We start with the easiest, most obvious approach<br>
and work our way up to a more sophisticated solution, pointing out the pros and cons of<br>
each along the way. If you just want the "answer" without any fanfare, skip ahead to<br>
the section "Mo' Better: Use a Loader Component to Manage Registration."
</p>
<p>
I assume that you're familiar with the Component Manager and that you know<br>
something about how components are written. For more information on these topics,<br>
see<i>Inside Macintosh: More Macintosh Toolbox</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;and "Techniques for Writing and<br>
Debugging Components" in<i>develop</i> Issue 12. 
</p>
<h2>THE SYSTEM VERSION AND THE COMPONENT MANAGER</h2>
<p>
The Component Manager behaves slightly differently depending on the version of<br>
system software it's running under and how the Component Manager was installed. It's<br>
important to know about these subtleties in order to understand how to work with the<br>
Component Manager to install your components properly. 
</p>
<p>
In system software version 6.0.7, the Component Manager is installed as part of an<br>
INIT (usually the QuickTime INIT). During the INIT installation, the Component<br>
Manager examines the contents of the System Folder and its subfolders for files of type<br>
'thng'; in each 'thng' file, it looks for resources of type 'thng', which it then uses to<br>
register the corresponding components. The important point here is that the<br>
Component Manager is not available until after the INIT has been installed. 
</p>
<p>
Like system software version 6.0.7, versions 7.0 and 7.0.1 pick up the Component<br>
Manager via an INIT, and so again the Component Manager isn't around until after the<br>
INIT has been installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main difference in System 7 is that in addition to<br>
searching the System Folder and its subfolders for component files, the Component<br>
Manager will also examine the contents of any subfolders that are in the Extensions<br>
folder. 
</p>
<p>
Examples of INITs in system software versions 7.0 and 7.0.1 that install the<br>
Component Manager are QuickTime, AppleScript, and Macintosh Easy Open. Note that<br>
your component can't assume that just because the Component Manager is installed,<br>
QuickTime is installed -- always use the Gestalt selectors to determine what<br>
functionality is available. 
</p>
<p>
The Component Manager is actually part of System 7.1 and, as a consequence, is<br>
available before the INIT process is started. 
</p>
<h2>METHODS FOR MANAGING COMPONENT REGISTRATION</h2>
<p>
Now that we have a good idea of when the Component Manager is installed and where it's<br>
searching for components, let's see what we can do to make sure that our components<br>
get registered in the order we want them to be registered. 
</p>
<p>
We'll use some simple components to illustrate the various methods we might use to<br>
manage component registration. In the sample code provided on the CD are three<br>
components -- Moe, Larry, and Curly -- that together establish a functional<br>
component hierarchy (see Figure 2). The hierarchy is such that Moe doesn't depend on<br>
any other components, Larry depends on Moe, and Curly depends on both Larry and<br>
Moe. To enforce these dependencies, we use register routines in Larry and Curly to<br>
make sure that the components they need are present before they actually allow<br>
themselves to be registered with the Component Manager. To let us know when each of<br>
these components is actually registered, Moe's register routine calls SysBeep once,<br>
Larry's calls SysBeep twice, and Curly's calls SysBeep three times. By the way, these<br>
components really don't do anything useful at all, but you probably figured that out<br>
already. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 2</b> The Moe, Larry, and Curly Component Hierarchy
</p>
<p>
<b>RISKY: LET THE COMPONENT MANAGER TAKE CARE OF IT</b><br>
We can always simply let the Component Manager do whatever comes naturally -- in<br>
this case, auto- registration. This method works only as long as you aren't picky about<br>
the order in which your components are registered. (Obviously, if your component<br>
doesn't depend in any way on the presence of other components, you're golden.) In our<br>
example scenario, though, we can't count on the Component Manager recognizing our<br>
constraints and doing the right thing. The Component Manager doesn't have enough<br>
information to know that our components have an ordering dependency (kinda reminds<br>
you of INITs, doesn't it?). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Nonetheless, let's look at what happens. The following is what occurs on my Macintosh<br>
Quadra 700 running System 7.1 and QuickTime 1.6, but you shouldn't infer that this<br>
is how the Component Manager will behave from now until eternity -- there is no<br>
documentation whatsoever that provides this kind of detailed information on component<br>
registration behavior, so it<i>can</i> change. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;We start with each component in a separate file. We might expect that the Component<br>
Manager would register component files in alphabetic order, and in fact this is exactly<br>
what happens. The first component that the Component Manager tries to register is<br>
Curly. However, Curly needs both Moe and Larry before it can be registered, and<br>
neither of them is present, so Curly bails. Larry comes next, and because Larry needs<br>
Moe, and Moe isn't around yet, Larry bails. Moe is last, and Moe doesn't depend on any<br>
components at all, so Moe is registered successfully. One out of three's not too good,<br>
though. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;We might further expect that if we put all of our components in a single file, the<br>
Component Manager would walk the component resources from lowest resource ID to<br>
highest resource ID. If that were true, all we'd have to do is give our components<br>
ascending resource IDs in the order in which we want them to be registered (say, 200<br>
for Moe, 300 for Larry, and 400 for Curly), and we'd be done! Well, I know we all<br>
long for the day that the omniscient System will always figure out the right thing to do<br>
regardless of how we've specified that it be done, but that day's not here yet -- or, to<br>
quote KON, "It's just a computer."
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The Component Manager calls Count1Resources to find out how many 'thng' resources<br>
are in a file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It then iterates through these resources, using the Get1IndResources<br>
call. Unfortunately, there's no guarantee that the Resource Manager will index<br>
resources in the same numeric order as their corresponding resource IDs; that is,<br>
even if Moe's 'thng' resource ID is lowest (200), Moe's resource index (as maintained<br>
by the Resource Manager) may or may not be 1.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;If we actually go ahead and try this (you can try this yourself with the Moe, Larry,<br>
and Curly component file on the CD, which I created by simply Rezzing the three<br>
components into a single 'thng' file), we find that we get exactly the same behavior we<br>
observed with the separate component files -- first Curly fails, then Larry fails, and<br>
only Moe registers successfully. This approach just isn't reliable enough for our<br>
purposes, and we need a better mousetrap. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BETTER: USE AN INIT TO MANAGE REGISTRATION</b><br>
Here's an idea -- we can use an INIT to manage the registration order of our<br>
components! We'll create a resource that describes the order in which to register our<br>
components, and then the INIT can read this resource, registering the component<br>
resources in the specified order. The registration order is simply defined as the<br>
position in the component list; that is, the first component in the list is registered<br>
first, the second component in the list is registered second, and so on. 
</p>
<p>
<b>The component load order resource. </b>We use a custom resource, called a<br>
component load order resource, to indicate to our INIT the order in which the<br>
components in the INIT file should be registered. The resource type is defined as 'thld'<br>
(for "thing load") and the resource is a 1-based list of structures of type<br>
ComponentLoadSpec, as defined below:
</p>
<p>
<code>#define kComponentLoadOrderResType&nbsp;&nbsp;'thld'</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>typedef struct ComponentLoadSpec {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ResType componentResType;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;componentResID;</code><br>
<code>} ComponentLoadSpec, *ComponentLoadSpecPtr, **ComponentLoadSpecHdl;</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>typedef struct ComponentLoadList {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;count;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ComponentLoadSpec&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spec[1];</code><br>
<code>} ComponentLoadList, *ComponentLoadListPtr, **ComponentLoadListHdl;</code>
</p>
<p>
The componentResType field contains the component resource type, in this case 'thng',<br>
and the componentResID field contains the component resource ID. 
</p>
<p>
<b>The loader INIT. </b>Our INIT -- called, surprisingly enough, LoaderINIT -- doesn't<br>
really do much work. When the INIT is executed, it checks to see whether the Shift key<br>
or mouse button is held down; if so, it quits. If not, it then checks for the presence of<br>
the Component Manager, and if the Component Manager is installed, it tries to load our<br>
components with a call to the LoadComponents routine. 
</p>
<p>
<code>main (void)</code><br>
<code>{</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KeyMap keys;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// INIT setup for THINK C (these routines are defined in</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// &lt;SetupA4.h&gt;)</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RememberA0();</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SetUpA4();</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// If mouse or Shift key down, don't bother.</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetKeys (keys);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (!Button() &amp;&amp; !(1 &amp; keys[1])) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSErr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result = noErr;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Is the Component Manager available?</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (HasComponentMgr()) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Load the components!</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result = LoadComponents (kComponentLoadListResType,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kLoaderBaseResID);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// INIT cleanup for THINK C (this routine is defined in</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// &lt;SetupA4.h&gt;)</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RestoreA4();</code><br>
<code>}</code>
</p>
<p>
<b>The LoadComponents routine. </b>LoadComponents does the job of reading the<br>
component load order resource and loading each of the components it points to; this<br>
routine is shown below. 
</p>
<p>

<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return (result);</code><br>
<code>}</code>
</p>
<p>
<b>Why it's too good to be true. </b>LoaderINIT works fine if we're running System 7.1<br>
or later (the Component Manager is installed<i>before</i> the INIT 31 process begins) or we<br>
name LoaderINIT something alphabetically greater than the name of the INIT that's<br>
installing the Component Manager (assuming we know this somehow). If neither of<br>
these conditions is met, LoaderINIT will execute before the Component Manager is<br>
installed, and none of our components will be registered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bummer. 
</p>
<p>
We could do something sneaky like patch a trap that we've observed being called right<br>
before the Finder comes up, and then execute our INIT code. In effect, this defers our<br>
normal INIT execution until after all other INITs load (provided they aren't pulling the<br>
same sneaky trick). However, we'd rather be more elegant and, dare I say, more<br>
compatible. We could also name our INIT ~LoaderINIT (or something similar) to<br>
guarantee that we run last in the INIT sequence (a somewhat naive hope), but we'd<br>
rather not become participants in the latest chapter of the ongoing saga of INIT Wars<br>
(Chapter XX: MacsBug Strikes Back). So what's a component developer to do?
</p>
<p>
<b>MO' BETTER: USE A LOADER COMPONENT TO MANAGE REGISTRATION</b><br>
Fortunately, we don't have to give up yet. We can avoid the shortcomings of the INIT<br>
approach by using a component to load our components -- a component we'll call, oh, I<br>
don't know, something original; how about . . . a loader component. 
</p>
<p>
<b>The loader component. </b>The loader component is a very simple component. It<br>
implements only the open, close, can do, version, and register selectors, and has no<br>
unique selectors of its own. It resides in a file of type 'thng', so the Component Manager<br>
will auto-register it. Also, the cmpWantsRegisterMessage flag is set in the<br>
componentFlags field of its component resource so the Component Manager will send it<br>
a register message at auto-register time. Our other three components (Moe, Larry,<br>
and Curly) are also included in the loader component file. 
</p>
<p>
When the loader component is registered, it receives three messages from the<br>
Component Manager -- open, register, and close. The register routine does all the<br>
work. It performs basically the same checks that are performed in LoaderINIT and<br>
calls the same LoadComponents routine described earlier to manually register Moe,<br>
Larry, and Curly. The loader component's register routine is shown below.

<b>The 'gnht' resource. </b>Everything's pretty cool up to this point, except for one<br>
minor detail -- we can't keep the component resources for Moe, Larry, and Curly as<br>
'thng' resources in our loadercomponent file.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Well, if they<i>are</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;kept as 'thng'<br>
resources, they'll be auto-registered along with the loader component, and our<br>
carefully constructed mechanism for managing registration goes right out the window!<br>
Worse, we end up trying to load our components twice -- once via the Component<br>
Manager's auto-registration mechanism, and once by our own loader component! 
</p>
<p>
So, we need to mildly fake out the Component Manager. We do this by keeping Moe,<br>
Larry, and Curly's component resources around as 'gnht' resources instead of 'thng'<br>
resources. The 'gnht' resource is identical to the 'thng' resource, but the Component<br>
Manager doesn't know to look for it, so Moe, Larry and Curly aren't auto-registered.<br>
The loader component (whose component resource is of type 'thng')<i>does</i> get<br>
auto-registered, and it knows where to find the component resources for Moe, Larry,<br>
and Curly because the component load order resource provides this information. Recall<br>
that in LoaderINIT, the component load specs in the component load order resource all<br>
point to resources of type 'thng'. We simply change these fields to point to resources of<br>
type 'gnht', and we're set!

<h2>PRACTICE SAFE REGISTRATION</h2>
<p>
In this article, we've looked at several approaches to installing components in a<br>
predetermined order.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While you're encouraged to adapt these methods freely to fit<br>
your particular problem, keep in mind that your solution should strive to be as<br>
compatible as possible with other system extensions -- your users will thank you for<br>
sparing them the frustration of renaming and removing extensions just to get your<br>
software running!
