Symmetry is more interesting than you might think. At first glance there doesn't seem<br>
to be much to it, but if you look a little closer you'll find that symmetry runs swift and<br>
cold and deep through many human pursuits. Symmetry concepts are found at the heart<br>
of topics ranging from the passionately artistic to the coolly scientific, and from the<br>
trivial to the fundamental. 
</p>
<p>
I learned a lot about symmetry while trying to learn how to create tile shapes. I've<br>
always been intrigued and tantalized by M. C. Escher's periodic drawings, the ones that<br>
use lizards or birds or fish or little people as jigsaw puzzle pieces, interlocking and<br>
repeating forever in a systematic way to completely tile a surface (mathematicians<br>
call this<i>tessellation</i> of a plane). My own halting attempts to draw tessellations have<br>
met with only tepid success. Especially hard is creating tiles that are recognizably<br>
something other than meaningless abstract shapes. 
</p>
<p>
To accomplish this feat of tiling a plane, you have to apply a set of constraints to<br>
everything you draw. Every line serves multiple purposes. In one of Escher's prints,<br>
for example, the same line that forms the left arm of one lizard also forms the tail of<br>
an adjacent lizard. That line is also repeated ad infinitum across the plane;<i>every</i> <br>
lizard's left arm and tail is defined by that same line shape. Now think about drawing a<br>
line like that. Not only are you drawing two shapes with one line (which is difficult<br>
enough), but you're also drawing innumerable identical lines simultaneously. They<br>
sort of spin out from the point of your pencil in a dazzling dancing tracery of lines.<br>
Trying to hold all that complexity and interrelatedness in your head is very, very<br>
difficult. 
</p>
<p>
Being a basically lazy person with too much time on my hands, I decided to write a<br>
program that would handle it all for me. I envisioned a direct manipulation kind of<br>
thing: as I changed a line, all the other corresponding lines in the pattern would change<br>
simultaneously. I figured it would be easy to draw little people and leaves and fishes<br>
that perfectly interlocked, if only I didn't have to keep all those interdependencies and<br>
constraints in mind and could just draw. Also, I thought maybe that by interactively<br>
"doodling" and being able to watch the whole pattern change on the fly, I could get some<br>
sort of gut feeling for the constraints. 
</p>
<p>
All this was way back in 1990. To learn more, I bought a book called<i>Handbook of</i><br>
<i>Regular Patterns: An Introduction to Symmetry in Two Dimensions</i> by Peter S.<br>
Stevens. The book is a sort of systematic catalog of hundreds of regular patterns,<br>
including many of Escher's, and also has a great introduction to the mathematics of<br>
symmetry (which turns out to figure heavily in this tiling business).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately,<br>
after an intense but superficial examination and an evening or two playing with pencil<br>
and paper and little dime store pocket mirrors (bought in a frenzy of excitement the<br>
day after I bought the book), I decided that the program would be<i>way</i> too hard to write<br>
to make it worth it, and shelved the whole thing. 
</p>
<p>
Well, last month I finally picked up the idea again. QuickDraw GX was getting close to<br>
being released, and it had features that made it relatively easy to implement what I<br>
wanted: very flexible transformation and patterning capabilities, and excellent hit<br>
testing, which makes implementing direct manipulation of lines a snap. So I dusted off<br>
Stevens's book and my little mirrors and got to work, trying to figure out the<br>
constraints on the tiles and implement the program. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Here's a basic fact about tiling a plane that I still find thoroughly remarkable three<br>
years after I first learned about it: there are only 17 possible arrangements of tiles.<br>
"But wait!" I hear you cry in your many-throated voice, "How can that be? Surely<br>
there are a very large number -- nay, an infinite number -- of possible tile<br>
shapes?"
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Well, yes, that's true. But the way they fit together, the underlying structure, will<br>
always be one of only 17 possibilities. This applies to<i>any</i> two-dimensional pattern<br>
made up of regularly repeating motifs, not just seamless tilings. The motif that's<br>
repeated, of course, can be anything: a leaf, a loop, or a lizard; a frog, a flower, or a<br>
fig -- it makes no difference. There are still only 17 ways to build a regularly<br>
repeating 2-D pattern. This was proved conclusively in 1935 by a mathematician<br>
named von Franz Steiger. (Yes, that's his name; I checked twice.)
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;To see why, you need to learn a little about the fundamental symmetry operations and<br>
how they combine with one another to breed other symmetry operations. I'll gloss over<br>
most of the details (see Stevens's book, or any introductory text on crystallography,<br>
for more info), but the gist of it is that when you sit down and begin to repeat some<br>
motif by repeatedly applying fundamental symmetry operations -- like reflection and<br>
rotation -- you find an interesting thing: combining symmetry operations with one<br>
another often causes other types of symmetry to sort of spring into existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the<br>
operations always seem to gather themselves into the same few groups. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Figure 1 shows a very simple example. We start with a simple motif (a comma shape)<br>
and repeat it by applying a transformation to it, in this case by reflecting it across a<br>
vertical line. Then we reflect the whole thing again, this time across a line<br>
perpendicular to the first one. The resulting pattern of four commas possesses mirror<br>
symmetry in two directions, meaning that a reflection of the<i>entire pattern</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;across<br>
either one of the lines leaves the pattern unchanged. But if you study it, you'll find<br>
another symmetry embedded in the pattern that we didn't explicitly specify. In<br>
particular, it shows<i>rotational</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;symmetry: rotating the pattern 180&#186; about its center<br>
leaves it unchanged, too. 
</p>

<b>&nbsp;Figure 1</b> Building a Simple Symmetry Group
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Figure 2 shows an alternative way to create the same pattern. This time we begin with<br>
the rotation (the point of rotation, or<i>rotocenter</i> , is shown by an oval). If we then run<br>
a mirror line through the rotocenter, we produce exactly the same structure, the<br>
same<i>symmetry group</i> , as we did by combining two perpendicular reflections above.<br>
These three symmetry operations (two perpendicular reflections and a 180&#186; rotation)<br>
come as a set. Combining any two automatically produces a pattern that also contains<br>
the third. This is where the constraints on the structure of regular 2-D patterns<br>
appear. No matter how you combine and recombine the fundamental operations to cover<br>
a plane, you find yourself generating the same 17 arrangements, the same 17 groups<br>
of operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 2</b> Another Way to Build the Group
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;By the way, this example group isn't one of the 17 plane groups. It's one of the<br>
10<i>point</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;groups<i>,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;groups whose constituent transformations operate around a single<br>
point. In case you're curious, there are also 7<i> line</i> groups (ways to repeat motifs<br>
endlessly along a line) and 230<i>space</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;groups (ways to repeat a solid shape to fill<br>
three-dimensional space). I don't know if anyone has figured out the groups of<br>
higher-dimensional spaces. Knowing mathematicians, I don't doubt it. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;So what about that computer program I was going to write? As this column goes to<br>
press, it's undergoing its second major overhaul, having suffered mightily from my<br>
"write it first,<i>then</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;design it" philosophy. So far I have 5 of the 17 groups<br>
implemented, and it's pretty cool. There's no telling how far I'll actually get before my<br>
deadline arrives, but I'll put the results, however clunky and raw they may be, on this<br>
issue's CD so that you can check it out. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I've learned a couple of things already: Even with the constraints automatically<br>
handled by the computer, it's still really hard to create representational shapes that<br>
will tile a plane, though creating abstract tile shapes is suddenly a piece of cake. Also,<br>
I still haven't gotten the kind of gut-level understanding of the<i>structure</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;of the<br>
patterns that I was hoping for (though just watching them change as I doodle is very<br>
entertaining). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I've also learned along the way that symmetry concepts go far deeper than the simple<br>
plane groups I'm messing with. The rules of symmetry and of form are, in a sense,<br>
manifestations of the structure of space itself. It's an odd thought that space<i>has</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;a<br>
structure, isn't it? Normally we think of space as a sort of continuous nothingness, as<br>
an<i>absence</i> of structure or as a formless container for structure. But space itself<i>does</i><br>
have a structure, and every single material thing must conform to that structure in<br>
order to exist. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Physicists, of course, have been trying very hard for a long time to describe<br>
precisely the nature of space. Einstein thought that there was really nothing in the<br>
world<i>except</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;curved, empty space. Bend it this way, and you get gravity, tie it in a<br>
tight enough knot and you get a particle of matter, rattle it the right way and you get<br>
electromagnetic waves. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;And there are other symmetries, symmetries even more fundamental. Einstein's<br>
theory of special relativity broke some of the central symmetries in physics, and thus<br>
called attention to the<i>role</i> of symmetry in science. Shortly afterward a mathematician<br>
named Emmy Noether established a remarkable fact: each symmetry principle in<br>
physics implies a physical conservation law. For instance, the familiar conservation<br>
of energy law is implied by symmetry in time -- energy is conserved<i>because</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;time is<br>
symmetric. (Of course, I'm greatly oversimplifying here. The symmetry of time is one<br>
that Einstein tarred and feathered and ran out of town on a rail. He showed that under<br>
extreme conditions time is<i>not</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;symmetric, and energy<i>isn't</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;conserved. Reassuringly,<br>
he replaced these broken and bloodied false symmetries with fresh new ones, but<br>
they're well beyond the scope of this column and my poor addled brain.) The point is<br>
that symmetries seem to be part of the very fabric of the universe; they seem to be the<br>
warp and weft of existence itself. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Yes, it's heady stuff indeed, this symmetry business. I'm staying plenty busy just<br>
trying to understand the symmetries possible in a plane, thank you very much, so I'll<br>
leave worries about the symmetry of space-time or of K-meson decay to the pros. Once<br>
again, I find that by looking just beneath the surface of a seemingly innocuous topic, I<br>
find depth and complexity beyond measure. Ain't life grand?
