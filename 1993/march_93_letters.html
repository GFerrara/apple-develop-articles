<b>TECH NOTES: WORD IS OUT</b><br>
Why are the Tech Notes in Microsoft Word documents? Are you assuming all<br>
developers have Microsoft Word? I don't think this is a good assumption. Developers<br>
who don't have Microsoft Word would be required to either purchase it or get an illegal<br>
copy. Or I suppose they might be able to use their favorite word processor and convert<br>
the Tech Notes if such converters exist.<br>
<p>
Big developers may have the capital to purchase Microsoft Word but small or starting<br>
developers may not, especially those enthusiastic and creative programmers in school.<br>
It would be a shame to force them to get an illegal copy of Microsoft Word so that they<br>
could learn the same wonderful magic tricks that others get from the Tech Notes.
</p>
<p>
Is it possible to produce the Tech Notes in a minimal text editor such as TeachText or<br>
DocMaker? Or better yet, why not use Apple DocViewer like the <i> New Inside Macintosh</i><br>
documents?<br>

<p>
<i>This is a timely question, as the format of Tech Notes on the CD has changed. But first,</i><br>
<i>some background.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>There are several reasons why we distributed Tech Notes as Microsoft Word</i><br>
<i>documents. Internally we use Microsoft Word as the authoring tool for Tech Notes</i><br>
<i>because of its relatively powerful formatting abilities and ease of use. It also turns out</i><br>
<i>that most word processing packages, such as MacWrite</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#174;<i> II, have translators that do a</i><br>
<i>reasonable job on Microsoft Word documents, so most people have access to the</i><br>
<i>information. We're firmly</i> against<i> pirating software!</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Also, our primary commitment has been to providing the highest quality technical</i><br>
<i>material possible; rather than focusing on format conversion, we chose to improve the</i><br>
<i>overall content and organization of the Tech Notes. Only then were we ready to turn our</i><br>
<i>full attention to the question of format.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>You mention Apple DocViewer as a possible alternative format -- we have in fact</i><br>
<i>converted the Tech Notes into Apple DocViewer format (take a look on the CD). Over</i><br>
<i>time this will be improved to provide better indexing and cross-reference facilities</i><br>
<i>-- whose absence we've been painfully aware of in the Microsoft Word format.</i><br>

<b>LICENSING DOCVIEWER</b><br>
We are a long-time Macintosh educational software developer. We've traditionally<br>
converted our printed documentation to HyperCard&#174; for on-line use by our<br>
customers. I wondered to whom we should speak to request developer licensing of Apple<br>
DocViewer?<br>
--Rhett Tindall
</p>
<p>
<i>Apple DocViewer documents are sourced from several word processors. These</i><br>
<i>documents must be processed in another application before they become DocViewer</i><br>
<i>documents. This application is currently not of commercial quality and is for Apple</i><br>
<i>internal use only. However, we're in the process of investigating whether to refine the</i><br>
<i>application and make it available outside Apple. This process may take some time and</i><br>
<i>may not result in providing the software to external parties. Please stay tuned!</i><br>

<b>MORE PRELIMINARY NIM?</b><br>
Many thanks for your magazine and CD. I've been following the progress of <i> New Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i> for a while and I wanted to know if it would be possible to get more<br>
preliminary drafts put on the CD. The Network volume and the book that includes the<br>
Sound Manager would be naturals, since the information for both of those areas are<br>
sprawled all over the regular <i> Inside Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;books.
</p>
<p>
Having that handy soft copy would make life easier and give us a peek at what we won't<br>
see till next year.<br>
-- Ron Stevenson<i>I've asked around and haven't been able to get any specific answers</i><br>
<i>for you. It's not clear when or if preliminary New Inside Macintosh drafts will become</i><br>
<i>available for the CD in he future. But I've passed on your suggestions, and the</i><br>
<i>Technical Publicatiosn group will do the best they can. Once the books are final, they</i><br>
<i>will of course be put on the CD.</i><br>
