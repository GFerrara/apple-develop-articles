<i>See if you can solve this programming puzzle, presented in the form of a dialog</i><br>
<i>between Konstantin Othmer (KON) and Bruce Leak (BAL) -- and a special guest, Apple</i><br>
<i>summer intern Mike Dodd. The dialog gives clues to help you. Keep guessing until</i><br>
<i>you're done; your score is the number to the left of the clue that gave you the correct</i><br>
<i>answer. These problems are supposed to be tough. If you don't get a high score, at least</i><br>
<i>you'll learn interesting Macintosh trivia.</i>
</p>
<p>
Mike Hey, guys. I've got one for you I bet you can't get.
</p>
<p>
KON Well, I haven't been able to get you over to the poker game; maybe I can beat you<br>
here. Wanna put your summer salary on it, schoolboy?
</p>
<p>
BAL Careful, Mike. You're talking to trained professionals here.
</p>
<p>
Mike OK. We have this true multimedia application that does lots of things: plays<br>
movies and sounds and does some GWorld stuff. After a while it crashes with a corrupt<br>
heap, usually SysError 33, and sometimes with a bus error. I'm using the latest<br>
QuickTime, and I have that snazzy PowerPC QuickDraw extension that installs<br>
PowerPC native QuickDraw on 68K-class machines.
</p>
<p>
BAL Sounds like some quality software you're running there. I doubt it's QuickTime's<br>
fault.
</p>
<p>
KON Yeah, and the PowerPC stuff is pretty awesome. You wouldn't stick us with some<br>
stupid application bug, so it's probably a problem with the Sound Manager. Is this that<br>
MoveHHi Sound Manager problem? MoveHHi snags the whole stack, and when the sound<br>
interrupts come in, the stack overflows into the application space, corrupting the<br>
heap. Since the Sound Manager is at a higher interrupt level than the stack sniffer<br>
VBL, it never detects the problem. Unsolved Mysteries: Solved!
</p>
<p>
<b>100 </b>Mike I'm using the new Sound Manager, version 3.0.
</p>
<p>
BAL I guess Reekes did a good job with compatibility on the new Sound Manager. He<br>
even maintained all the bugs!
</p>
<p>
Mike Reekes swears there's not a line of code the same between the new and old Sound<br>
Managers. Besides, the new Sound Manager patches MoveHHi to not use as much stack.
</p>
<p>
KON Does it happen with the old Sound Manager?
</p>
<p>
<b>90 </b>Mike Yep. Same thing.
</p>
<p>
BAL Hmmm. So what are the circumstances around the crash? Do you have a<br>
reproducible case?
</p>
<p>
<b>80 </b>Mike It seems to happen fairly randomly. But it generally occurs when I push a<br>
button that plays a sound. Sometimes it happens the first time I push the button; other<br>
times I push the button over a hundred times before it crashes.
</p>
<p>
KON Turn on heap scrambling in the application and system heaps and run something<br>
like the MemHell extension, which forces a worst-case memory scenario. That should<br>
bring the problem out more frequently. Maybe you can get a reproducible case.
</p>
<p>
BAL Yeah, and turn on A-trap recording and heap checking so that we can narrow down<br>
the problem area.
</p>
<p>
<b>70 </b>Mike The application is running really slowly now, but the problem doesn't<br>
happen any more frequently. Every time you crash, you notice the last trap that the<br>
application called was SndNewChannel.
</p>
<p>
KON Wait a second. The application calls SndNewChannel every time it plays a sound?<br>
It should just call SndNewChannel once at startup for each channel it needs and then<br>
keep reusing those.
</p>
<p>
BAL What happens if you fix the application?
</p>
<p>
<b>65 </b>Mike The problem goes away. But you haven't found the bug yet. Although calling<br>
SndNewChannel all the time may slow you down, it isn't illegal and shouldn't cause<br>
heap corruption.
</p>
<p>
BAL Is anything else going on while the sound is being played?
</p>
<p>
<b>60 </b>Mike The problem seems to happen only while a movie is playing. The application<br>
calls SndNewChannel, SndPlay, and SndDisposeChannel every time it wants to make a<br>
sound, but why the crash?
</p>
<p>
BAL Does the movie have sound? What happens if you turn off the sound in the movie?
</p>
<p>
<b>55 </b>Mike The problem goes away.
</p>
<p>
KON What's the last trap called inside SndNewChannel before the crash?
</p>
<p>
<b>50 </b>Mike MoveHHi.
</p>
<p>
KON What if you don't play the video?
</p>
<p>
<b>45 </b>Mike It crashes.
</p>
<p>
BAL Change the button that's doing the SndNewChannel, SndPlay, and all that other<br>
stuff; make it so it creates a bunch of handles and calls MoveHHi on them instead.
</p>
<p>
<b>40 </b>Mike Now the machine crashes more frequently.
</p>
<p>
BAL So now we know that MoveHHi and playing the sound in the movie have something<br>
to do with it. Make it so that when you push the button, the movie starts playing at the<br>
beginning; then do NewHandle, MoveHHi, and DisposeHandle in a loop with a counter,<br>
and keep the loop counter at location 0 so that when you crash you can see which<br>
iteration you're on. You might have to make the size of the handles vary in case the<br>
failure depends on block size or position, since that'll help spread the allocations<br>
throughout the heap.
</p>
<p>
<b>35 </b>Mike It seems to happen consistently on the sixty-ninth iteration of the loop,<br>
reproducibly, if I start from launching the program.
</p>
<p>
KON Go into MacsBug and put a breakpoint in the loop when the loop counter is 69.
</p>
<p>
<b>30 </b>Mike You hit your breakpoint and trace over the call to MoveHHi, and it works<br>
fine. If you say go, you crash a hundred iterations later.
</p>
<p>
KON Rather than use MacsBug, change the code to break on the sixty-ninth iteration.<br>
Then what happens when you trace over MoveHHi?
</p>
<p>
<b>25 </b>Mike It works fine.
</p>
<p>
BAL OK. Change the code to break on the seventieth iteration.
</p>
<p>
<b>20 </b>Mike You get to the breakpoint at 70 and everything is fine.
</p>
<p>
KON So somehow this thing is timing sensitive. Have the program compare with a<br>
really big number and see when the heap goes bad. Then change the number so that it<br>
breaks right before the problem code.
</p>
<p>
<b>15 </b>Mike When you break and trace, it doesn't happen.
</p>
<p>
BAL What if I turn off interrupts during my MoveHHi loop?
</p>
<p>
<b>10 </b>Mike It works fine, but you only hear the first half second of sound from the<br>
movie. Since interrupts are blocked, the Sound Manager can't call back to QuickTime to<br>
get the next piece, which QuickTime has queued up in the mean time.
</p>
<p>
KON Great, so what you're saying is we can now break right before the MoveHHi that<br>
would cause it to happen if we didn't break there.
</p>
<p>
BAL Right, so go ahead and break there. Dump the state of the heap and log it to a file.<br>
Then do the same thing, this time comparing with a higher number and letting it trash<br>
itself, and dump the heap again. Compare the heaps and figure out what's going on.
</p>

<p>
<b>5 </b>Mike The interesting part of the heap before and after the MoveHHi call is shown in<br>
the figure. Before MoveHHi there was a locked block, labeled A in the figure, which is<br>
marked as relocatable afterward. The relocatable block just below locked block B is<br>
getting overwritten by the block we're calling MoveHHi on.
</p>
<p>
KON MoveHHi works by first saving the contents of the block that you're moving, then<br>
marking the block as free. Then it calls CompactMem on the heap, which bubbles all<br>
the free space up to any islands and all relocatable blocks down. Then it copies the<br>
block to the free block just before the island.
</p>
<p>
BAL And someone is coming in at interrupt time and unlocking the island, block A in<br>
the figure. Instead of remembering the location of the island, MoveHHi searches for it<br>
after the CompactMem call. Since that block was unlocked by an interrupt after<br>
CompactMem, a different block is found the second time. When MoveHHi backs up to the<br>
previous, presumably free, block and starts copying data, the heap gets trashed.
</p>
<p>
Mike Yeah, that interrupt unlocking the block was QuickTime, BAL. It turns out the<br>
Sound Manager does the same thing. Apparently the "system architects" at the time<br>
thought it was OK to call HUnlock on a locked block during an interrupt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not! We fixed<br>
it by deferring all HUnlock calls until MoveHHi finishes. This was the cleanest fix; it<br>
keeps us from patching out huge parts of the Memory Manager. But we were stumped<br>
for quite a while.
</p>
<p>
KON Nasty.
</p>
<p>
BAL Yeah.
</p>
<p>
SCORING
</p>
<ul>
<li>75-100 We'd award you a copy of Debugging Macintosh Software, but<br>
obviously you don't need it.</li>
<li>50-70 We'd award you a copy of Debugging Macintosh Software, but then<br>
KON would miss out on his royalties.</li>
<li>25-45 Only scores from your first reading count.</li>
<li>5-20 Outfoxed by a summer intern. Care to join our poker game? *</li>
</ul>
<p>
KONSTANTIN OTHMER AND BRUCE LEAK have been awarded a subcontract to debug the<br>
Ada software for the cost-reduced space station backup project, code named<br>
BALKON-4. While BAL has found that rocket science makes him nauseous, KON has<br>
taken to weightlessness like a bug to code and is thinking of opening KONstellation, the<br>
first casino in space.*

Mike DODD is the official QuickTime perpetual summer hire, just finishing his fourth<br>
summer with Apple. He claims that someday he'll actually graduate from the<br>
University of Tennessee and get a full-time job. Mike spends a lot of his time inside<br>
MacsBug trying to make QuickTime crash less, or at least finding cool bugs to try to<br>
stump KON and BAL with. *
