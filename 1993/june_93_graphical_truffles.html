<p>
QuickDraw regions were almost lost when Bill Atkinson crashed his car and nearly<br>
killed himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that Steve Wozniak also crashed his airplane, crashing<br>
must be a hallmark of Apple genius. I'm no Macintosh wizard, though I did crash my<br>
car once. To aid and abet other non- wizards, I'll divulge four cool answers that apply<br>
to nearly any QuickDraw question:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the graphics state. </li>
<li>Check the QuickDraw version. </li>
<li>Do it off-screen. </li>
<li>Use the bottlenecks.</li>
</ul>
<p>
They may not answer your questions completely, but they'll probably get you partway<br>
there. 
</p>
<p>
<b>CHECK THE GRAPHICS STATE</b><br>
Whenever you call a QuickDraw routine, its behavior depends heavily on the state of<br>
the machine at the time of the call: things like the pen size, transfer mode, and color<br>
environment all affect the drawing. Most of the state information QuickDraw depends<br>
on can be found in two handy locations -- the current grafPort and the current<br>
GDevice. 
</p>
<p>
The grafPort maintains state information for the pen, the text, and the bitmap (or<br>
pixel map) to draw into. The GDevice defines the color environment, among other<br>
things. This information is accessed by many QuickDraw routines. For example, the<br>
LineTo routine draws a line from the current pen location to the point you pass to the<br>
routine, using the current pen size, pattern, and transfer mode; all these values are<br>
fields of the current grafPort. Because most QuickDraw routines use these "implied"<br>
parameters, you can't fully understand the behavior of a QuickDraw routine without<br>
knowing about them. 
</p>
<p>
The current grafPort also defines where your drawing will occur. Even though you call<br>
a routine, it may not draw, because QuickDraw applies a rectangle -- the portRect --<br>
and two regions -- the visRgn and clipRgn -- to your drawing. No drawing will occur<br>
outside the intersection of these areas. QuickDraw places control of the clipRgn in your<br>
hands, first initializing it to be wide open (a rectangular region that covers the entire<br>
QuickDraw coordinate space). If your grafPort is in a window, control of the visRgn is<br>
placed in the hands of the Window Manager. (A region is a truly marvelous concept, a<br>
compact description of strange shapes that can be extended and changed dynamically.<br>
It's a good thing Bill Atkinson survived his crash.)
</p>
<p>
Let's try applying this first answer to a common QuickDraw question: Why can't you<br>
nest calls to OpenPicture? Well, as you may know, when you call OpenPicture to begin<br>
saving picture data, a handle is created to store the picture information until the<br>
corresponding ClosePicture call. This handle is kept in the picSave field of the current<br>
grafPort. If you nest a second OpenPicture call, where in the grafPort will you store<br>
the newly created handle? Answer: There is no place, so you can't nest OpenPicture<br>
calls. Because so many other Managers rely on QuickDraw, this answer will help with<br>
questions about other Managers as a bonus. 
</p>
<p>
<b>CHECK THE QUICKDRAW VERSION</b><br>
There are currently seven versions of QuickDraw.<br>
You can find out which version is available using Gestalt, and that's usually the most<br>
important thing for your code to know about. But many developers also want to know<br>
which machine and system software combinations produce which versions of<br>
QuickDraw. For example, some developers code for 32-Bit QuickDraw and want to<br>
inform their users of the minimum Macintosh machine requirement. The ROM<br>
version, extensions, and system software all combine to affect which version of<br>
QuickDraw is available. 
</p>
<p>
ROM versions of QuickDraw can be neatly categorized into three classes of machines:<br>
black and white, Color QuickDraw, and "ci class." The original Macintosh and the<br>
Macintosh 512K, Plus, Portable, SE, and PowerBook 100 are examples of the<br>
black-and-white class. The Macintosh II, IIx, IIcx, and SE/30 fall into the Color<br>
QuickDraw (256K ROM) class. The Macintosh IIci, IIsi, LC II, IIfx, and later models<br>
belong to the ci class (&gt;256K ROM). 
</p>
<p>
<b>Black-and-white class. </b>There are only two common versions of QuickDraw on<br>
black-and-white machines today: original black-and-white QuickDraw and System 7<br>
black-and-white QuickDraw.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The uncommon ones are present only with<br>
pre-Macintosh Plus ROMs or system versions earlier than 4.2.) When System 7 is<br>
installed on a machine of this class, it installs some new routines so that a few Color<br>
QuickDraw routines can be used (you get 1-bit GWorlds, you can correctly display<br>
pictures containing direct-color information, you can create version 2 pictures, and<br>
so on). 
</p>
<p>
Black-and-white QuickDraw is documented in<i>Inside Macintosh</i>Volumes I and IV. For a<br>
comprehensive list of the routines that System 7 adds to black-and-white QuickDraw,<br>
see "QuickDraw's CopyBits Procedure: Better Than Ever in System 7.0" in <i>develop</i><br>
Issue 6.
</p>
<p>
<b>Color QuickDraw class. </b>This class of machines has 8-bit Color QuickDraw built<br>
into ROM, so it will always be there regardless of the system version. When these<br>
machines are running system versions earlier than System 7, they can be extended to<br>
handle direct color through the use of the 32-Bit QuickDraw INIT. Finally, if they're<br>
running System 7, System 7 Color QuickDraw is available. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Inside Macintosh</i>Volume V describes 8-bit Color QuickDraw. For documentation on the<br>
various 32- Bit QuickDraw versions, including System 7 Color QuickDraw, the best<br>
place to look is <i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume VI. If you really need to know the differences<br>
in capabilities among the versions, 32-Bit QuickDraw v. 1.0 is covered in "Realistic<br>
Color for Real-World Applications" in <i>develop</i> Issue 1, and the features added in<br>
32-Bit QuickDraw v. 1.2 are documented in the Tech Note "32-Bit QuickDraw:<br>
Version 1.2 Features."
</p>
<p>
<b>ci class. </b>This class of machines has only three possible QuickDraw versions. The<br>
least common version, 32-Bit QuickDraw v. 1.01, is found on a IIci running system<br>
software version 6.0.4. The other machines in this class that can run System 6 need at<br>
least version 6.0.5, which will patch in 32- Bit QuickDraw v. 1.2. Finally, System 7<br>
provides its own version of Color QuickDraw. 
</p>
<p>
Again, for documentation on the various 32-Bit QuickDraw versions, including System<br>
7 Color QuickDraw, see<i>Inside Macintosh</i>Volume VI. 
</p>
<p>
In the GestaltEqu.h header file, you'll find Gestalt values for six QuickDraw versions:
</p>
<p>
<code>gestaltOriginalQD =0x000,// 1-bit QD</code><br>
<code>gestalt8BitQD =&nbsp;&nbsp;0x100,// 8-bit color QD</code><br>
<code>gestalt32BitQD = 0x200,// 32-bit v1.0</code><br>
<code>gestalt32BitQD11 =0x210,// 32-bit v1.1</code><br>
<code>gestalt32BitQD12 =0x220,// 32-bit v1.2</code><br>
<code>gestalt32BitQD13 =0x230,// 32-bit v1.3</code>
</p>
<p>
One of these -- gestalt32BitQD11 -- will never be returned, so this list accounts for<br>
only five of the total of seven versions. The sixth is 32-Bit QuickDraw v. 1.01,<br>
mentioned above, which returns the Gestalt value 0x201 but doesn't have a gestalt<br>
constant defined for it. The seventh is System 7 with a black-and-white machine:<br>
You'll need to check for both black-and-white QuickDraw (gestaltOriginalQD) and<br>
System 7 (gestaltSystemVersion greater than or equal to $0700). If both are true,<br>
you're running System 7 black-and-white QuickDraw.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the only way to tell.
</p>
<p>
Table 1 shows all the possible combinations, in one handy location.

<p>
Exactly which permutations you need to code for depends entirely on what you're doing,<br>
but typically the major divisions are color versus black-and-white, direct color<br>
versus indexed color, and GWorlds versus no GWorlds. Whenever possible, of course,<br>
you should make decisions in your code based on the QuickDraw version rather than on<br>
the specific machine configuration. 
</p>
<p>
<b>DO IT OFF-SCREEN</b><br>
Off-screen environments give you explicit and total control over an image. Since the<br>
image and its associated data structures are no longer tied to a physical device, many of<br>
the complexities and limitations of QuickDraw are reduced, and your hands --<br>
previously tied tightly behind your back -- are now freed. You'll typically manipulate<br>
your image off-screen and then use CopyBits to move the image to the screen. The FX<br>
snippet on this issue's CD provides a robust demonstration of some snazzy CopyBits<br>
effects, and there's a nice overview of how to perform animation using off-screen<br>
graphics environments in the Graphical Truffles column ("Animation at a Glance") in<br>
<i>develop</i> Issue 12. 
</p>
<p>
Using CopyBits and off-screen environments for speed is covered eloquently in<br>
Konstantin Othmer and Mike Reed's article "Drawing in GWorlds for Speed and<br>
Versatility" in <i>develop</i> Issue 10, so I won't dwell on it here. Also, the Tech Note<br>
"Principia Offscreen Graphics Environments" gives details for creating off-screen<br>
environments on machines without 32-Bit QuickDraw (see the discussion above). 
</p>
<p>
The point is this: when faced with a question in the "How do I . . ." category, try this<br>
answer on for size first. That may be as far as you need to go. 
</p>
<p>
<b>USE THE BOTTLENECKS</b><br>
QuickDraw routines are easily customizable, which can be incredibly useful; however,<br>
this feature is typically underused. (In fact, most of the Macintosh is customizable.<br>
There ought to be a whole chapter in <i>Inside Macintosh</i> on customization; there are so<br>
many places in the OS that you can intercept, you could probably patch out the whole<br>
OS if you were so inclined.) You can replace QuickDraw's "guts" with viscera of your<br>
own design, completely (and reversibly) transforming QuickDraw's functionality. 
</p>
<p>
Here's one example of how this can be useful: Let's say we want to find out the exact<br>
colors used in a picture that contains innumerable colors. We'll be drawing the picture<br>
to an 8-bit color monitor, and we want to manually select the best 256 colors,<br>
replacing the default color table that DrawPicture uses. There are two methods of<br>
getting the colors used in a PICT: use the System 7 Picture Utilities Package, or do it<br>
yourself. The Picture Utilities Package is available only in System 7, so if we want to<br>
run on earlier systems, our only choice is to do it ourselves. We do that by using the<br>
bottlenecks. 
</p>
<p>
You can replace all the bottlenecks with no-ops except for a few carefully selected<br>
ones, then draw the picture. Your replacement bottlenecks will be able to watch all the<br>
picture data go by and can keep track, say, of the colors used in the picture. (Two<br>
sample programs on the CD, CollectPictColors and GMundo, demonstrate this<br>
technique.) So, for instance, to draw our many- colored picture with a custom-picked<br>
set of 256 colors, we actually have to draw the picture twice: the first time, we<br>
replace the bottlenecks, allowing us to use -- collect, extract, or read -- the colors in<br>
the picture. We can then set up the destination cGrafPort with the colors we want to<br>
show, restore the bottlenecks, and draw the picture again, this time to actually image<br>
it into the destination cGrafPort. 
</p>
<p>
<b>THAT'S IT FOR NOW </b>When you're faced with a question about QuickDraw, try<br>
running through the answers in this column first, to see if any of them fit. Is the state<br>
of the machine at the time of the call different than you assumed? Did you check the<br>
QuickDraw features and version? Can you do it off-screen? Can you intercept<br>
processing at the bottleneck level to customize QuickDraw's routines? It's likely that<br>
one of these answers will help.
