<p>
In May of this year, Apple and Adobe Systems released version 8.0 of the LaserWriter<br>
driver -- the biggest change to PostScript&#174; printing on the Macintosh in eight years.<br>
This new driver was rewritten from the ground up by engineers at Adobe, working<br>
closely with Apple engineers who provided source code, guidance, and comprehensive<br>
testing. The resulting driver unleashes the power of PostScript Level 2 printing as<br>
much as possible under the limitations of the pre-QuickDraw GX printing<br>
architecture. 
</p>
<p>
Since the driver has been in general release for quite some time, we won't go through<br>
feature lists or repeat things you've seen printed elsewhere. Instead we'll focus on how<br>
your application can compatibly take advantage of the new driver's power. We'll also<br>
note some programming practices that cause problems with LaserWriter 8 and that<br>
will continue to cause grief in the future with QuickDraw GX. 
</p>
<p>
<b>WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION</b><br>
The best news for programmers about this driver is that there's more information<br>
available for this driver than for any printer driver before it. It follows the standard<br>
Printing Manager API documented inInside MacintoshVolumes II and V, which you<br>
should stop reading immediately when you can grab Inside Macintosh: Imaging With<br>
QuickDraw. The new book has vastly superior organization and information about<br>
printing, including what's covered in the older Macintosh Technical Notes, Q&amp;As, and<br>
other sources of information Apple has refined through the years. Even if you don't yet<br>
have the new book, everything in the older volumes and in the Technical Notes is still<br>
valid, with few exceptions. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, this issue's CD contains a 25-page document called "Developer<br>
Information," located in the LaserWriter 8 folder, that talks about differences between<br>
the old and new drivers. Since this driver was in open beta test from October 1992<br>
through May 1993 as "PSWriter," the changes shouldn't surprise too many people.<br>
The "Developer Information" document has been available since October 1992 as well,<br>
so all kinds of great information have been at your fingertips for quite some time. 
</p>
<p>
<b>THE GROUND RULE</b><br>
The new driver has several exciting new API calls to assist with PostScript printing<br>
and translation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before getting into them, we must state The Ground Rule:<br>
<i>While you're encouraged to use new LaserWriter 8 features where appropriate, your</i><br>
<i>application should </i>not <i>depend on them. Your handling of printing or key services</i><br>
<i>should not fail if the features aren't available.</i>
</p>
<p>
Some users may not have upgraded to LaserWriter 8, and some may be running<br>
specialized versions of the older driver and don't want to give it up. More important,<br>
however, is that the new API features provided through PrGeneral arenot present in<br>
QuickDraw GX. In its initial release, QuickDraw GX makes it easy for PostScript<br>
printer manufacturers to create their own drivers supporting all their<br>
printer-specific features; under the old architecture this was about as easy as<br>
removing your eyeballs from their sockets with your toes. This means there's a chance<br>
that a customer will have softwarebeyondLaserWriter 8 that doesn't support the new<br>
calls documented on the CD, so use them only if they're present. 
</p>
<p>
For example, if you have an application that uses PostScript printer description<br>
(PPD) files to obtain information about a target printer, you can use the new driver's<br>
PSPrimaryPPDOp selector to PrGeneral to obtain an FSSpec referencing the PPD file<br>
the user chose for the current printer in the Chooser. However, if the driver isn't<br>
available, the new PrGeneral calls return the error opNotImpl (opcode not<br>
implemented) or resNotFound (the current driver doesn't support PrGeneral). In this<br>
case, you should ask the user to locate the PPD file just as you did before LaserWriter<br>
8 was available. You shouldnot display an alert saying "You have the wrong printer<br>
driver chosen; go fix it."
</p>
<p>
Another example is in the powerful new functions that the driver provides for<br>
converting QuickDraw pictures to encapsulated PostScript (EPS) format. If using<br>
these functions allows you to export EPS data in a cross-platform document for higher<br>
fidelity on another system, that's great. If the driver isn't available, though, you need<br>
to create your own EPS data or provide some alternate representation of the data<br>
(perhaps a bitmap or a TIFF image). 
</p>
<p>
Remember, these functions are there to use if they're available, but you can't require<br>
them. It's not fair to remove features from your application based on the printer<br>
driver version. Try to use them if you need to, but be prepared for when they're not<br>
present. 
</p>
<p>
Sample code that helps explain the new features is also on the CD, in the same folder as<br>
the new driver. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NEW THINGS YOU CAN DO</b><br>
With that caveat on the table, let's discuss how some of the new features might affect<br>
your program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There isn't room here to cover all the new APIs or their uses, so be<br>
sure to check out the documentation and sample code on the CD for the comprehensive<br>
scoop. 
</p>
<p>
<b>PostScript printer description files. </b>In addition to using PPD files in<br>
applications, some people will need to create PPD files for custom in-house purposes,<br>
or because they're developing PostScript-compatible hardware. There's a trick that's<br>
undocumented (and unguaranteed, so don't write code that depends on this!) which lets<br>
the driver help you debug your PPD files: Normally, when the driver parses a PPD<br>
file (during Chooser selection), it puts up a simple error dialog saying "This PPD is<br>
invalid" if it finds a problem with the file. However, the driver has a resource of type<br>
'PLRT' with ID 1 that contains a single byte, normally 0. If you change this byte to<br>
$01, the driver will display an alert during PPD parsing saying exactly what it didn't<br>
like and on what line it didn't like it. Since PPD files can get fairly complicated in<br>
short order, this feature can be extremely helpful. 
</p>
<p>
This preference is stored in a PLRT resource only in versions 8.0 and 8.0.1 (shipping<br>
with Adobe Acrobat). In later releases, it will be combined with some other useful<br>
preferences in a PRFS resource. There's a resource editor TMPL template describing<br>
the bits in the PRFS resource. One of these bits tells the driver to write all Printer<br>
Access Protocol (PAP) transactions to a PAPToDisk file so that you can debug your<br>
printing code's output. This lets you see what the driver generates during normal<br>
printing (not what it generates in the special case of creating a PostScript file) and is<br>
quite handy. Have fun with the preferences, but remember not to ship code that relies<br>
on them -- don't modify them from your code. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Dealing with EPS files. </b>The older LaserWriter driver had been creating<br>
PostScript files as a debugging aid for several years, and in version 7.0 this feature<br>
was finally added to the print job dialog so that users could visibly control it. In 8.0,<br>
the file creation mechanism has been further improved: it now provides user control<br>
over PostScript language level, font inclusion, and ASCII or binary protocol, and can<br>
create EPS files on request. Since so many applications understand EPS files, this<br>
feature gets a lot of exercise, and fosters some misunderstandings. The encapsulated<br>
PostScript file format version 3.0 is discussed in Appendix H of Adobe'sPostScript<br>
Language Reference Manual, Second Edition (the "red book"). The red book clearly<br>
states that an EPS file describes animage of a single page. That's why printing a range<br>
of pages to an EPS file gives you an image of only the first page -- you can't have an<br>
image of more than one page in an EPS file. 
</p>
<p>
The main problem users are having with EPS files created by the driver, however, is<br>
with the EPS preview. This preview is an optional PICT resource of ID 256 which, if<br>
present, contains a QuickDraw picture resembling what a PostScript interpreter<br>
would produce after executing the EPS code. 
</p>
<p>
LaserWriter 8 does previews in three ways: it creates a picture that's one giant<br>
bitmap or pixel map ("standard preview"); it creates a picture containing all the<br>
drawing commands used to draw the page ("enhanced preview"); or it doesn't create a<br>
preview at all. The choice is the user's, or at least it'ssupposed to be. Some<br>
applications don't like the word "optional" very much and refuse to import EPS files<br>
that don't contain the "optional" preview. Don't make the mistake of considering the<br>
preview to be required. 
</p>
<p>
Since the information for the preview picture comes from the drawing your<br>
application does into the printing grafPort, there's trouble if your application doesn't<br>
draw things as the driver expects. For example, some applications still examine the<br>
high byte of the wDev field in the print record and, if they find the value 3, assume<br>
they're talking to a PostScript printer. 
</p>
<p>
Such programs send all their data to be printed as custom PostScript code, not drawing<br>
anything into the printing grafPort. This makes for an extremely boring preview<br>
image -- your code didn't draw anything, so there's nothing in there to display. 
</p>
<p>
If you create your own PostScript code,alwayssend dual QuickDraw and PostScript<br>
information when printing or exporting pictures. Never create PostScript code<br>
without making as faithful a QuickDraw representation as you can. Not only does this<br>
prevent EPS preview problems with LaserWriter 8, it prevents problems under<br>
QuickDraw GX, where users can redirect print files after you've finished your print<br>
loop but before they're imaged on a printer. If you sent only PostScript code and the<br>
user redirects the print job to a StyleWriter II because the PostScript printer is<br>
busy, the result will be a bunch of blank pages. 
</p>
<p>
Some people have asked why EPS files created by the driver seem to be the size of a<br>
printed page when the real image is only a small part of the page. That happens when<br>
your application doesn't change the clipping rectangle for the image it's printing and<br>
when you send no QuickDraw code, but only PostScript code. The driver watches all<br>
drawing you perform in the printing grafPort to calculate the bounding rectangle for<br>
the EPS file; it has no way of knowing what that rectangle would be for any PostScript<br>
code you send, so it relies on the clipping rectangle when your PostScript code is sent<br>
through the printing grafPort. Use ClipRect to set the clipping rectangle of the<br>
printing grafPort to match the height and width of your image. The driver will<br>
accumulate all your clipping rectangles and make the bounding rectangle of the EPS<br>
file the smallest rectangle that encloses all of them plus the bounding rectangles of all<br>
QuickDraw drawing you performed. If you send both QuickDraw and PostScript code as<br>
recommended, you won't have this problem. 
</p>
<p>
<b>OLD THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT NOW</b><br>
Some things are bound to change when you rewrite code from the ground up -- mostly<br>
implementation details that were never guaranteed. That doesn't stop enterprising<br>
programmers from finding such details and using them, though, and that's where a lot<br>
of compatibility problems occur. Here are some things that have changed in the new<br>
driver that shouldn't have affected your programs, but might have anyway. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Using private PostScript operators. </b>Apple has advised programmers for a long<br>
time not to use "Laser Prep" or "md" dictionary operators -- private PostScript<br>
operators used by the LaserWriter driver to get its work done. Those operators were<br>
never documented or guaranteed to work, and as the driver changed over the years so<br>
did many of the procedures, breaking applications that relied on them. It's no big<br>
surprise that almost every one of those operators is either gone or changed in the new<br>
driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;There's been some confusion in the past about just what Apple was trying to<br>
warn against, so I'm pleased to take this opportunity to make it very clear:If it's not in<br>
the PostScript Language Reference Manual, including appropriate supplements for<br>
your printer, don't use it. 
</p>
<p>
Don't use any PostScript procedures you didn't define unless they're part of the<br>
language. If you find a procedure defined in LaserWriter 8 that does something you<br>
want to do, don't call it! The PostScript system in QuickDraw GX is entirely different<br>
from the one in LaserWriter 8; if you just substitute one set of procedures that you<br>
shouldn't call for another, your application will break again in the near future. 
</p>
<p>
I would even avoid using printer-specific features, because with EPS files you're<br>
never sure what the target printer will be. If you must use these features, wrap them<br>
in PostScript's "stop" mechanism so that the job will complete even if the feature<br>
creates an error. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Precision Bitmap Alignment. </b>In version 8.0, the Page Setup option "Precision<br>
Bitmap Alignment" still says "(4% reduction)" at the end of the item in the Options<br>
dialog. That will change in versions after 8.0 because the code will change. 
</p>
<p>
In 8.0 and earlier, the Precision Bitmap Alignment option simply reduces the<br>
coordinate system to 96% of the former value, turning 300-dpi printers into<br>
288-dpi printers. Since 288 dpi is an even multiple of 72 dpi, the screen resolution,<br>
this prevents rounding errors in bitmaps where some bits would be slightly larger<br>
than others. Unfortunately, this only solves the problem on 300-dpi printers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On<br>
400-dpi printers (such as are often found in Japan), it changes the resolution to 384<br>
dpi, which doesn't help.
</p>
<p>
Sometime after 8.0, "Precision Bitmap Alignment" will start aligning to the nearest<br>
lower multiple of 72 dpi available on the target printer, calculated by the PostScript<br>
code when printing. On a 400-dpi printer, that's 360 dpi for a 10% reduction. On a<br>
600-dpi printer, it's 576 dpi and is again a 4% reduction. The point is to get<br>
precisely aligned bitmaps, not to reduce by exactly 4%, and past 8.0 that's how it will<br>
work. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Font substitution. </b>In the past, turning on fractional font widths with<br>
SetFractEnable(TRUE) disabled font substitution. With LaserWriter 8, you always get<br>
font substitution when you ask for it. 
</p>
<p>
In LaserWriter 7.1.1 through LaserWriter 7.2, turning off font substitution would<br>
sometimes give you a TrueType version of a font if you had it -- even if the printer<br>
had a Type 1 version available -- depending on whether you'd turned off line layout or<br>
enabled fractional font widths, and on what day of the week it was. This inconsistent<br>
behavior is removed from LaserWriter 8: once again, Type 1 fonts are always picked<br>
over TrueType fonts if both are available to the printing system. This is largely for<br>
compatibility with pre-TrueType systems. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Older customization resources. </b>The older drivers supported mechanisms for<br>
adding device- specific items to non-Apple printers, such as custom page sizes and<br>
code to enable sheet feeders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These resources, if present, are ignored by LaserWriter<br>
8 -- printer manufacturers can control feeders, custom page sizes, and other<br>
device-specific features through PPD files. We later discovered that some<br>
enterprising developers were using the 'feed' resource to control things other than<br>
sheet feeders, since the mechanism gave them a chance to execute code on the Macintosh<br>
during the job dialog. That wasn't what it was designed for, so no one made any effort to<br>
make sure that would still work. That mechanism is now gone. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Color QuickDraw pixel patterns. </b>Before LaserWriter 8, attempting to print<br>
with pixel patterns (as opposed to older black-and-white patterns) generally<br>
produced stunning black blobs on your page.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With LaserWriter 8, printing with pixel<br>
patterns works just as you'd hope it would if the user chooses either<br>
"Color/Grayscale" or "Calibrated Color/Grayscale" (making the printing grafPort a<br>
cGrafPort) and if the printer supports PostScript Level 2 so the driver can use the<br>
Level 2 PostScript pattern mechanism. On Level 1 devices, pixel patterns are<br>
implemented using screens (color screens if available, halftone screens otherwise)<br>
and the patterns are clipped to their upper left eight-by-eight grid, matching the<br>
dimensions of a regular QuickDraw pattern. Even though the implementationisn't<br>
perfect on Level 1 devices, something much closer to your desired pattern than a black<br>
blob now appears. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Preferences file. </b>The new driver keeps a preferences file in the Preferences folder<br>
(or in the System Folder under System 6). It's in this file that the driver stores the<br>
parsed PPD data, plus the recorded choices of which printers match which PPDs and<br>
some other driver-specific data that needs to stick around. If you ever update drivers<br>
manually, delete the old preferences file. Its contentswillchange from version to<br>
version. If you share one driver file among systems trying to isolate or reproduce a<br>
problem and you want to have the best chance of seeing the problem again, be sure to<br>
keep the preferences file with the driver as you bop between systems. 
</p>
<p>
<b>THE REST IS WAITING FOR YOU</b><br>
If you have comments or bugs to report about the LaserWriter 8 driver, you can send<br>
them on AppleLink to the read-only address LWDRIVER.BUG. You won't get a response<br>
or an acknowledgment, but your feedback will get to the people responsible for making<br>
changes. Don't forget to look at the information on the CD for the complete story! 
</p>
<h2>SUMMARY OF NEW API FEATURES IN LASERWRITER 8</h2>
<p>
These are new selectors to PrGeneral. Full details and sample code are located on the<br>
CD. Remember, don't even think about requiring these calls in your program.
</p>
<ul>
<li>PSPrimaryPPDOp: Returns an FSSpec record locating the PPD file chosen<br>
for this printer, along with a Boolean value indicating whether the file is the<br>
built-in "generic" PPD.</li>
<li>getPSInfoOp:Informs you if the target printer supports PostScript Level<br>
2 and binary communications. Also tells you what kind of PostScript file the<br>
user chose to create, if any: EPS with no preview, EPS with standard preview,<br>
EPS with enhanced preview, or PostScript job file format.</li>
<li>PSIntentionsOp: Allows your code to tell the driver that you intend to use<br>
PostScript Level 2 or binary communications features, so that the driver can<br>
generate appropriate DSC (document structuring conventions) comments and<br>
return errors if the target printer doesn't support those features.</li>
<li>PSpict2eps: Converts a QuickDraw picture into an EPS stream. You can<br>
specify most of the parameters in the style and job dialogs, and you provide a<br>
callback routine that receives the EPS stream as it's created.</li>
<li>PSFontInfo: Provides a PostScript stream to make a given outline font<br>
available on a PostScript interpreter, including the TrueType scaler and<br>
TrueType conversions of fonts if necessary. You provide a callback routine to<br>
receive the font information from the driver. Bitmap fonts are not supported.</li>

While we refer to the driver here&nbsp;&nbsp;as "LaserWriter 8," Adobe distributes the same<br>
driver as "PSPrinter." Adobe also licenses the driver to printer manufacturers who<br>
license PostScript language software from Adobe, and those printermakers may call<br>
the driver by different names as well. Apple's initial release of the driver is named<br>
"LaserWriter 8.0," but later releases (which may happen by the time this is<br>
published) will be named "LaserWriter 8." No matter what the driver is called or how<br>
the icons appear, the internals are the same and all the information here applies. *
