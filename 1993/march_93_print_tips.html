<h2>PRINT TIPS</h2>
<h2>LOOKING AHEAD TO QUICKDRAW GX</h2>

<p>
With the release of QuickDraw GX later this year, there are a few changes in store for<br>
print land. In this column, I'm going to talk about two of these changes -- the<br>
disappearance of the PDEF 10 resource from the QuickDraw GX LaserWriter driver,<br>
and the disappearance of the 'STR ' (-8192) and 'PAPA' (-8192) resources from a<br>
system running QuickDraw GX.
</p>
<p>
Like most changes, the fact that these resources are going away is both good news and<br>
bad news. The good news is that printing is going to work much better in the GX world<br>
than it does today. For one thing, the new printer driver architecture provides<br>
functionality that used to be unavailable through the Printing Manager, which is why<br>
people got involved in directly grabbing resources in the first place. The bad news is<br>
that if you<i>are</i> currently grabbing these resources, you're going to have some problems<br>
running under QuickDraw GX, and you need to decide now how you're going to deal with<br>
this.
</p>
<p>
Before we get into solutions, however, let's back up a bit, and answer the question,<br>
What's a PDEF, anyway? A PDEF is just a code resource for printer drivers. All<br>
printer drivers contain multiple PDEFs, each of which implements a piece of the<br>
driver's functionality, like displaying dialog boxes or alerts. PDEF 10 contains the<br>
printer access protocol (PAP) code that enables a LaserWriter driver to communicate<br>
with a network printer. (For details about the interface to PAP, see Chapter 10,<br>
"Printer Access Protocol," in<i>Inside AppleTalk</i>.) Some applications that need the PAP<br>
code have acquired it by sucking PDEF 10 out of the LaserWriter driver. Before Apple<br>
put together its PAP software licensing package, grabbing PDEF 10 like this was a<br>
quick and easy way to get what you needed. But it's an approach that's unsupported by<br>
Apple and that has always carried the seeds of compatibility problems.
</p>
<p>
So what should you do if you're currently grabbing PDEF 10 out of the LaserWriter<br>
driver? You've got the following possible solutions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to grab PDEF 10, but make sure you're prepared to handle<br>
failure gracefully when you can't get it. Basically, you'll need to let the user<br>
know that your application isn't compatible with the version of system<br>
software being used -- that is, the QuickDraw GX-based system. Not a very<br>
user-friendly solution, but that might be OK for your application. </li>
<li>If all you need to do is download a PostScriptTM file to the LaserWriter,<br>
use the PostScriptHandle PicComment and a basic print loop. Most applications<br>
need to do a lot more than send a bunch of PostScript code down the pipe -- for<br>
instance, they need to set the characteristics of the PostScript printer -- but<br>
if your application's needs are really this limited, it can be happy in the GX<br>
world. If you're interested in this approach, take a look at the Technical Notes<br>
"A Printing Loop That Cares . . ." and "PicComments -- The Real Deal." You can<br>
also look at the PostScriptHandleDemo snippet in the Snippets folder on<br>
the<i>Developer CD Series</i>disc.</li>
<li>Write your own PAP interface files. This is a relatively time-consuming<br>
operation, but it gives you total ownership of the code, and your application is<br>
unlikely to break with future system software releases. Quite a few developers<br>
have had success with this approach. </li>
<li>License Apple's PAP library code -- the same library that's used within<br>
the LaserWriter Font Utility. The latest version (v. 1.5) of the library<br>
improves on the last version and has more complete documentation. If you're<br>
interested in licensing this library, please contact</li>

<ul>
<li>Use Apple's LaserWriter Font Utility and add your custom features to it.<br>
In System 7, the LaserWriter Font Utility can handle drop-in enhancements<br>
called UTILs. UTILs take care of all the communication issues for you, and they<br>
give you quite a bit of power and flexibility. If you're interested in this<br>
approach, take a look at "PostScript Enhancements for the LaserWriter Font<br>
Utility" in Issue 10 of<i>develop</i>. </li>
</ul>
<p>
At this point, you're probably wondering which solution is the best for you. It all<br>
depends on your requirements. From my point of view, any solution besides the first is<br>
acceptable if it will keep your users happy and keep you compatible with future<br>
system software releases. 
</p>
<p>
Now let's turn to the disappearance of the 'STR ' (-8192) and 'PAPA' (-8192)<br>
resources. On a non-QuickDraw GX system, the 'STR ' resource contains the name of<br>
the currently chosen printer driver, while the 'PAPA' resource contains the name and<br>
network address of the current PAP printer. Because QuickDraw GX will allow more<br>
than one active printer at a time, these resources will become obsolete.
</p>
<p>
Why is this a problem? Only because some applications currently grab the 'STR ' and<br>
'PAPA' resources to automatically select a printer without going through the Chooser.<br>
Under QuickDraw GX, it will be possible to redirect a print job to another printer via<br>
the Printing Manager's public API. So new applications and applications revised to<br>
work under QuickDraw GX will be able to programmatically redirect print jobs on the<br>
fly in a clean, supported manner.
</p>
<p>
If your application isn't GX-smart, the simplest way to deal with the disappearance of<br>
the 'STR ' and 'PAPA' resources is probably just to remove your application's feature<br>
of circumventing the Chooser.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your application absolutely requires this<br>
functionality, however, make sure that when these resources aren't available, you tell<br>
the user to go use the Chooser. This way your application will print on a QuickDraw GX<br>
system without any problems.
</p>
<p>
This column has looked at a couple of compatibility problems that can emerge when<br>
non- QuickDraw GX applications run under QuickDraw GX, and also at some of the ways<br>
that you can avoid these problems. As long as you're prepared to implement one of the<br>
solutions recommended here, your application will run just fine under QuickDraw GX.<br>
And on the bright side, QuickDraw GX is going to allow your application to access and<br>
control a vast amount of information at print time. QuickDraw GX will provide the API<br>
your application requires to take care of all the user's printing needs without having<br>
to cruise through printer driver or system resources. You asked for it, and soon you'll<br>
have it!
