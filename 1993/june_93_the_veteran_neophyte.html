I recently attended the First General Conference on Nanotechnology. The conference was<br>
sponsored primarily by the Foresight Institute, an organization based in Palo Alto,<br>
California, whose sole self-stated goal is to disseminate information about<br>
nanotechnology, to inform the public about the topic, and to just sort of do whatever<br>
seems necessary to get society ready, to prepare the ground, for the advent of this<br>
world-transforming future technology. (Apple also helped sponsor the conference, a<br>
fact I didn't even know until I arrived.) There had been previous "research" gatherings<br>
dealing with nanotechnology, but those were primarily for scientists and other<br>
gearhead types (most of whom, it should be noted, showed up for this one, too). This,<br>
though, was the first such gathering intended for the general public, and the first<br>
intended to foster open discussion on the topic by all kinds of people. 
</p>
<p>
It was absolutely fascinating, on lots of levels, and a total blast! It was intellectually<br>
and scientifically stimulating, of course, and that's a lot of fun by itself, in a quiet sort<br>
of way. But it was also an unparalleled opportunity to<i>watch some really weird</i><br>
<i>people,</i>and that's fun in a much larger, noisier sort of way. Watching wild ideas being<br>
bandied about by wild, zealous people is fine sport, and this was the perfect place for<br>
it. The enthusiasm among the participants was sizzling, and the whole thing smelled<br>
sort of cultish, almost religious in its zeal and drive. As I said, a blast! 
</p>
<p>
I don't want to imply that it was a circus, that the participants were doddering,<br>
babbling boobs or mindless, frenzied fanatics. Nothing could be further from the truth.<br>
On the contrary, there were<i>all</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;kinds of people there -- writers, computer folks,<br>
venture capitalists, cryonicists, physicists, doctors, marketers, biologists,<br>
businesspeople, you name it -- and the ideas being discussed were often taken very<br>
seriously. But there<i>was</i> a healthy contingent of fringe-dwellers and edge-runners,<br>
people whose beliefs often set them slightly apart from your average, ordinary citizen<br>
(whatever that is). People who like to peek over the edge -- any edge -- to see what's<br>
there. Nanotechnology is a precipitous edge indeed. 
</p>
<p>
Nanotechnology has been getting a lot of press lately, but for those of you who haven't<br>
heard or read about it yet, let me run you through the basics. Nanotechnology is the<br>
brainchild of one Dr. K. Eric Drexler, MIT graduate and technological visionary<br>
extraordinaire. (Some of the ideas and concepts of nanotechnology weren't new, but<br>
Drexler brought them together, gave them a name, and carried them much further<br>
than anyone else had dared.) Simply put, nanotechnology is the ability to precisely and<br>
completely control the structure of matter at the molecular or atomic level, by<br>
building the desired substance or structure molecule by molecule or atom by atom,<br>
placing each in the precise location we want. This capability has implications and<br>
ramifications without end, as we'll soon see.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the central spark of the idea --<br>
placing atoms one by one -- remains simple and elegant, and we should be careful to<br>
remember that fact as we wander, often lost in the churning chaos, through the<br>
landscapes of possibilities that this oh-so-simple idea can generate.&nbsp;&nbsp;(It's equally<br>
important, by the&nbsp;&nbsp;way, to remember that nanotechnology is still a fairy tale, though<br>
possibly a prophetic one. All the books, meetings, articles, discussions, and press<br>
coverage are about something that can't be done, at least not yet. So although the<br>
general buzz around the conference tended to use the present tense -- an indication of<br>
the rampant confidence most of these people possess -- it's all still a dream, though as<br>
compelling and disturbing a dream as any I've ever known, and one that's being dreamt<br>
by some very, very capable minds.)
</p>
<p>
The term<i>nanotechnology</i>has been popularized lately, for better or for worse, and has<br>
been applied to a number of very different technologies that are decidedly<i>not</i>what<br>
Drexler has in mind. Their only similarity with Drexler's nanotechnology is that they<br>
involve very small scales. You've probably all seen those electron microscope pictures<br>
of little bitty gears and shafts and motors and flaps that have been carved from silicon.<br>
There's a large effort under way to build these micromachines, and it's a fascinating<br>
technology, but it's not what we're talking about. Those efforts, like many others that<br>
are popularly called nanotechnology, are characterized by starting with some block of<br>
material -- a bazillion atoms in a chunk -- and carving out bits or adding bits like a<br>
sculptor to get the shape you want. The resulting parts are still made of a bazillion<br>
atoms; you're still dealing with<i>clumps</i> of atoms at a time. Drexler calls this<i>bulk</i><br>
<i>technology</i>. Admittedly, the clumps are getting very, very small these days, but it's<br>
really just a refinement of the same manufacturing technology we've had since the<br>
stone age: take a hunk of material and shape it. 
</p>
<p>
Drexler's nanotechnology -- he promoted the term<i>molecular manufacturing</i>at the<br>
conference, and it's a more descriptive, if less poetic, name -- comes around from the<br>
other side. It starts with individual atoms and molecules and puts them together,<br>
essentially one piece at a time, to build up the desired material or structure. This is<br>
the key distinction between bulk technology and what we're calling nanotechnology. 
</p>
<p>
Drexler also postulates a nanomachine he calls an<i>assembler.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>It's a general-purpose<br>
atom positioning machine, sort of a nano-scale robot, complete with sensors to detect<br>
the atom or molecule, some sort of "gripper" to hold and position it, and a powerful<br>
computer to control the thing. This is the little bugger that really cuts nanotechnology<br>
loose. If you have assemblers, you have the proverbial general manufacturing<br>
machine: you can build anything, including more general manufacturing machines.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
(Actually, these days people talk more about "mills" than individual robot-like<br>
assemblers. Mills are like production lines, with conveyor belts rather than arms,<br>
and a continuous flow of material.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in this column I'll use the word<i>assembler</i><br>
what I really mean is this: a machine that can arrange atoms and molecules in a general<br>
way, and therefore can be used to build anything we can think of.)
</p>
<p>
OK, so now that we have a handle on what we're talking about, let's play that game we<br>
all love so much, Predicting the Future. If we<i>could</i>be atomic bricklayers, if<br>
we<i>could</i>command the structure of matter, just what sorts of strange things would we<br>
build? Here's where we can really have some fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ramifications of being able to<br>
build things atom by atom are of course myriad. Nanotechnology is one of those ideas<br>
that, when planted firmly in human minds, seems to serve as a catalyst, breeding<br>
innumerable possible future scenarios. It's a technology (a nonexistent one,<br>
remember!) that could conceivably touch and transform every important aspect of our<br>
lives. 
</p>
<p>
Many scenarios are immediately apparent. For one thing, molecular manufacturing<br>
promises materials that are lighter, stronger, cheaper, and just generally better in<br>
every way. As any materials scientist will be happy to tell you, materials in the real<br>
world are generally riddled with defects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carving away at them or adding other bulky<br>
bits to them as we do today doesn't change that fact, and actually often exacerbates it.<br>
But if we could build up our materials atom by atom, each precisely placed, the<br>
resultant material would be atomically precise, atomically<i>perfect! </i>This would mean<br>
that we could build much, much lighter weight structures, using lots less material to<br>
do the same job.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in itself has enormous benefits, but it's just the beginning:<br>
beyond improving existing materials, we could build any<i>new</i>material we can think of,<br>
as long as it's allowed by the laws of nature. 
</p>
<p>
And the manufacturing processes themselves could be made amazingly efficient, using<br>
cheap and plentiful raw materials, producing virtually no waste, and consuming very<br>
little energy, if any at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conference there was much talk, only partly tongue<br>
in cheek, of a tabletop nanofabricator,about the size of a microwave oven, with four<br>
rubber feet and a fan in the back, plugged into the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Drexler's<br>
calculations we could feed this thing 1.6 kilograms per hour of feed stock solution<br>
(acetone, I think he said: a cheap and plentiful source of carbon and hydrogen) and 0.8<br>
kg/hr of atmospheric oxygen, and out the other end would come 1.0 kg/hr of diamond<br>
(or whatever carbon material you have in mind), 1.5 kg/hr of chemically pure water,<br>
1.1 kW of waste heat, and, as a by- product of the process, 3.6 kW of surplus<br>
electricity. (Why plug it in? So that you can deliver the electricity to the power grid.)
</p>
<p>
With manufacturing processes like that, economics is suddenly turned on its ear. Some<br>
say there would be no more poverty, that since with assemblers we'd be able to make<br>
nearly anything for nearly nothing, precious materials would no longer be precious;<br>
we could make treasure from garbage! Some say we could make food, or better yet,<br>
create new materials and technologies that let us make full use of the food we already<br>
produce, bringing an end to world hunger. 
</p>
<p>
Going even further out on an already shaky limb, let's examine some medical<br>
implementations. If we could build assemblers, we could build other nano-scale robots<br>
to do our bidding. Tiny observation machines could be injected into our bloodstream to<br>
seek out and report any damage, effectively giving doctors eyes into your body at the<br>
cellular level. How about nanogoop that you pour on a wound that disinfects it, seals it,<br>
and accelerates the regeneration of lost tissue? The cryonicists -- people who have<br>
themselves frozen for some hopeful future awakening -- have pinned most of their<br>
hopes for resuscitation on some sort of cell-repair machines that can go in and repair<br>
the tissue damage due to freezing. One speaker at the conference, an MD researching<br>
organ cryopreservation, planted his tongue firmly in his cheek and went truly wild<br>
with his speculations. Get this: subcutaneous "smart" armor that could see a blow or a<br>
bullet coming and<i>react</i>, bracing itself or maybe even pulling your skin away from the<br>
danger! He went on to talk about the "tradeoffs involved in becoming a flying person," a<br>
topic "no one has talked about before." (The conclusion was effectively that wings are<br>
very inconvenient and would really get in the way when you weren't flying, but they're<br>
probably worth the trouble.)
</p>
<p>
Then there are, of course, the "dark" scenarios. If it's possible to build assemblers, it<br>
will probably also be possible to build<i>dis</i>assemblers: imagine scavenger nanostuff<br>
whose programming has gone out of control, so that it disassembles anything it comes<br>
into contact with and just builds more copies of itself (I can see you artificial life fans<br>
pricking up your ears). This is known as the "gray goo" scenario. (Speculations about<br>
this sort of out-of-control goo cause equally energetic counter- speculations:<br>
encrypting the program so that a one-bit error turns it to hash; anti-goo goo --<br>
so-called "blue goo" -- that recognizes and destroys the gray stuff; using a "broadcast<br>
architecture" so that the machines have no autonomy at all, and thus can't get out of<br>
control in the first place; and so on.)
</p>
<p>
Machines building copies of themselves opens up a Pandora's box of implications and<br>
problems: if these machines are the least bit autonomous and there's the possibility of<br>
mutation -- of nonfatal errors when building new copies -- they'll naturally begin to<br>
evolve! Drexler makes the good point that at the atomic level things are either exactly<br>
right or exactly wrong, that nanomachines are wrought in a<br>
fundamentally<i>digital</i>medium and are therefore brittle, so errors will tend to be<br>
catastrophic and bring things to a screeching halt. But it seems to me that the<br>
nanomachines we're talking about -- machines that can sense their environment,<br>
harvest raw materials, and build copies of themselves, including their own<br>
instructions -- are so complex that a digital error, a bit error, may<i>not</i> bring<br>
everything to a halt, and may indeed change the operation of the machine in subtle,<br>
mysterious ways. Anyone who has ever programmed a computer can testify to that.
</p>
<p>
You can also bet that if one group of people has this technology and another doesn't, and<br>
those groups don't like each other, the results could be many kinds of ugly.<br>
Nanoweaponry could be more insidious and invisible than any biological weapon, more<br>
tenacious than radiation, and ultimately more destructive than any bomb. 
</p>
<p>
Good or bad, many of these scenarios seem pretty far out there. Which brings up a<br>
very good question: will it really ever happen? Will we ever be able to build a general<br>
manufacturing machine?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we ever gain that degree of control over matter?<br>
Naturally, Drexler thinks so, and so do many others. It's instructive to take a look at<br>
some of the practicalities involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;First there's the problem of scale. Obviously,<br>
there are an awful lot of atoms in a piece of material that's, say, the size of your fist.<br>
Won't it take a long, long time to build up something that size atom by atom? Well, we<br>
can do the arithmetic to find out: Let's assume that we could put individual atoms<br>
together at a rate of 100 atoms per second. And let's say we want to build 12 grams of<br>
diamond.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Diamond is a very popular material in these nano-examples, not because of<br>
its worth and beauty but because of its amazing hardness and stability and the fact that<br>
it's made of carbon, a very common element.) If you've ever taken a chemistry course<br>
you know that 12 grams of carbon contains 6.02 x 1023 atoms (Avogadro's number,<br>
remember?). A hundred atoms per second is 864,000 per day, assuming no time off<br>
for the little buggers. This is about 3.15 x 109 atoms per year. So we could get our 12<br>
grams of carbon in only, let's see, 6.02 x 1023 atoms divided by 3.15 x 109 atoms<br>
per year is roughly 2 x 1014 years. <i>That's two hundred million million years! </i>About<br>
fifty thousand times the estimated age of the earth! To build less than half an ounce of<br>
carbon. Hmm. Clearly we're going to have to do something drastic, numbers-wise, for<br>
this to be at all useful. Because of the extreme scales involved, the numbers quickly<br>
fly wildly out of control. 
</p>
<p>
Well, the only way I've heard discussed to bring those numbers under our control is to<br>
fight back with large numbers of our own, in this case large numbers of nanomachines<br>
(or conveyor belts, or whatever) working simultaneously. And the only way to get that<br>
many machines is to build nanomachines that can reproduce, that can build copies of<br>
themselves. It's like the old story about the blacksmith shoeing a horse, who charged a<br>
penny for the first nail, two pennies for the second, four for the third, and so on: he<br>
became rich on one horse. Back to our example, we'd need about 1.0 x 1017 machines<br>
working simultaneously, each placing 100 atoms a second, to get our 12 grams in<br>
under 24 hours. How long will it take to make that many machines? Well, if each<br>
machine can build a copy of itself in one hour (a conservative estimate: an average<br>
bacterium does it faster), and we start with one machine, I come up with something<br>
like 56 hours. Very doable. And, of course, if we let it go for one more hour, we have<br>
twice what we need! When you've got geometric progression on your side, you've got<br>
a<i>friend! </i>
</p>
<p>
OK, so maybe we can handle the scale problem, as long as we're willing to let machines<br>
self- reproduce. What about the problem of actually reaching in there and grabbing<br>
atoms or molecules?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it really possible to build molecular "hands"? Well, there are<br>
several technologies, each making rapid progress, that are converging on this<br>
capability. <i>Scanning Probe Microscopy</i>is a technology that shows great promise in<br>
positioning individual atoms (by now you've probably all seen that picture of "IBM"<br>
spelled out in individual atoms on a plate). Molecular biotechnology is another<br>
promising avenue: molecular biologists are gaining an amazing degree of control of the<br>
molecules of life, a degree of control that looks as though it will continue to increase<br>
quickly. (In a sense, using bacteria to manufacture insulin, as is done today,<i>is</i><br>
molecular manufacturing; it's just that most of the nanomachinery was borrowed from<br>
living things, rather than designed from scratch.) The point is that there are many<br>
paths that may lead us to atomic control of matter, not just one. 
</p>
<p>
But there are also some compelling arguments against the "full" vision, the future in<br>
which everyone has assemblers and we can make anything we want. First off, an<br>
assembler is a very, very complex machine, much more complex than anything<br>
humans have ever built, and I'm honestly not convinced that human beings are capable<br>
of<i>ever</i> deliberately building something like that. (Accidentally, maybe, but that's<br>
another story.)<i>You</i> try to design a machine, constructed entirely from sticky marbles,<br>
that can build a copy of itself from ambient sticky marbles floating nearby. Oh yeah,<br>
and it has to also be fully programmable, so that it can be instructed to build<br>
anything<i>else</i> (also from ambient sticky marbles). To my knowledge, no human has<br>
ever succeeded, at<i>any</i>scale, in building a purely mechanical machine that can build a<br>
copy of itself. But that's exactly what an assembler needs to be. 
</p>
<p>
Even if we can get the mechanics together, there's still The Software Problem;<br>
complex software is always buggy, and the more complex it is, the further from<br>
"correct" it will be and the more unpredictable will be the results of such errors.<br>
Anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about. The software to<br>
control a machine that can sense its environment, locate the appropriate parts, grab<br>
them, turn them the right way, and stick them to other parts is going to be more<br>
complex than anyone today knows how to write.
</p>
<p>
Then there's this sad fact: no technology is ever equally available to all people at its<br>
introduction, or for that matter for as long as there's some advantage, economic or<br>
otherwise, to maintaining controlover it.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the advantages to maintaining control of<br>
this one are obviously huge. What if you're the first one on the block with that tabletop<br>
machine (four rubber feet, remember) cranking out intricately structured diamond<br>
struts and electricity? Are you going to stop building your struts and start building<br>
copies of your machine for everyone else, or would you be tempted to sell those<br>
excellent struts (that no one else can make yet) for just a little while first, and build<br>
up a nest egg?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, I'll give<i>you</i>the benefit of the doubt, but what about that snake oil<br>
salesman over there? What do you think he would do? How about your government? If<br>
they had it first would they give a copy to you? To another country? These are hard<br>
questions, very hard indeed. 
</p>
<p>
There is, of course, one piece of irrefutable proof that nanotechnology can ultimately<br>
work: life itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a very real way, we<i>are</i> nanotechnology. What are we but a mass of<br>
autonomously running nanomachines frantically making copies of themselves and each<br>
other? What are we but "out of control" nanostuff that has attained a very high level of<br>
organization? Some theorists believe that the odds of the emergence of life are better<br>
than previously thought, perhaps even that it's inevitable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They believe that matter<br>
has an inherent tendency to organize itself, and that we are the result of that tendency.<br>
(I get this creepy image of matter sort of turning around to look at itself.) If we gain<br>
total control over matter, perhaps we will also, as part of the bargain, gain total<br>
control over life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now<i> that</i> would be something to write home about!
