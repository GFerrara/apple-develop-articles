<p>
The brain trust that makes up the heart, soul, and spleen of<i>develop</i> recently got<br>
together to have a few beers, pat each other on the back in a<br>
team-building-while-not-being-too-aggressive way, and just generally -- as Albert<br>
Einstein once said -- "figure it all out."
</p>
<p>
Two interesting things came out of the meeting. First, it's very difficult to pat each<br>
other on the back in a team-building-while-not-being-too-aggressive way after<br>
you've had a couple of beers; and second,<i>develop</i> has a serious flaw. A flaw as wide, as<br>
gaping, and as socially repugnant as the space between Alfred E. Neuman's teeth. 
</p>
<p>
As by now I'm sure you've discovered,<i>develop</i> is the<i>best</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;source for "how to" articles<br>
on Apple technology. It's the literary equivalent of an overprotective older brother in a<br>
strange neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet all those back issues of<i>develop</i> , combined with that big<br>
stack of CDs you save but never use, are doing<i> nothing</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;to help you survive in the<br>
day-to-day workplace. You may be able to write C++ in your sleep, but it's not going<br>
to do you any good if you don't know socially important things like who your company's<br>
CEO is or the finer points of water cooler etiquette. The raw philanthropic nature of<br>
this journal, combined with the necessity to fill a couple of extra pages, compels us to<br>
offer some useful office survival tips along with the gripping technical articles<i>develop</i><br>
has always delivered. 
</p>
<p>
From this point forward for eternity (or until I'm fired, or until the hate mail<br>
reaches unbearable levels), I'll be your tour guide through the political jungle of the<br>
modern office. Like any good companion, I'll be pointing out the nasty baboons from the<br>
safety of our digital van, helping you step around the virtual guano while we roam the<br>
electronic terra firma, bellowing at you when you try to feed your little sister to the<br>
lions, and pretending to know what I'm talking about when I don't have a clue. 
</p>
<p>
To offer the ultimate in customer service, and to provide snappy repartee, I'll be<br>
answering questions sent in by inquisitive readers and hand-picked by our crack staff.<br>
Rest assured your questions will be held in the utmost confidence, unless they have<br>
good blackmail potential. Everyone "fortunate" enough to have their questions printed<br>
will receive an incredibly cheap, yet heartwarmingly collectible, gift. Interestingly<br>
enough, questions arrived even before this column was announced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaks are<br>
everywhere, I guess.

<i>Dear Tao,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>As a product manager at a major U.S. software company, I often find myself losing in</i><br>
<i>negotiations with my colleagues for our company's internal resources. I always go into</i><br>
<i>meetings prepared and well rehearsed, and I always come out with less than I'd hoped</i><br>
<i>for.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The situation is growing desperate. I have yet to be promoted, and I'm afraid I'll need to</i><br>
<i>call in the loans I've made to my children so I can pay off my BMW.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Please help,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Distressed in Denver</i>
</p>
<p>
Dear Distressed,
</p>
<p>
You say you're a product manager yet you got your point across in fewer than ten<br>
pages. My guess is you're being too direct with people in the workplace. A rule of<br>
thumb: When dealing with people in the workplace, never be direct. 
</p>
<p>
There are several disadvantages to saying what's on your mind. One is that people will<br>
know what you're thinking. If you're dealing with someone who isn't direct, they'll<br>
automatically have an edge on you; they'll know what you know, but not vice versa. If<br>
you're dealing with someone who is truly malevolent -- the kind of person who bites<br>
the heads off marshmallow bunnies before eating the rest, or worse, someone who<br>
wears suspenders -- your directness can be very detrimental to what you're trying to<br>
accomplish.
</p>
<p>
As you've already learned, being direct can be especially harmful when dealing with<br>
management.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say you have some idea that you present honestly and forthrightly<br>
to your boss. When your boss responds with, "It basically seems like a good idea; let's<br>
see if we can work something out," what this really means is you're heading straight<br>
into a nightmare commonly referred to as "negotiation." This is bad news in a big way,<br>
because Boss School has taught your manager to (1) verbally whittle your idea into a<br>
headless monstrosity doomed for failure, and then (2) either take credit for your<br>
superhuman struggles in making the plan succeed or, more likely, crucify you<br>
mercilessly for failure. 
</p>
<p>
Just like everything else in the '90s, the answer to your problem lies in a<br>
combination of inner awareness, macrobiotic diets, shaky mutual funds, and self-help.<br>
Not being direct will seem unnatural at first, so I give you this as your homework: Put<br>
a marble on a table. Study it closely until you really begin to understand what that<br>
marble is all about. Then, for the next half hour, describe the marble without using<br>
the words "round" or "sphere." Once you think you've got it, ask some friends in and<br>
describe the marble to them. If they have no idea what you're talking about, you'll<br>
know that you're well on your way to honing one of the most important of your office<br>
survival skills. 
</p>
<p>
As for calling in those loans from your children: Mom, I<i>told</i> you that I'd pay you back<br>
when I got a chance. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Dear Tao,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I have an employee who is perpetually late and always uses the excuse "my dog got</i><br>
<i>loose." I've always been a bit suspicious, and upon checking I discovered that he doesn't</i><br>
<i>even own a dog! What should I do?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sign me,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Flea-Bitten</i>
</p>
<p>
Dear Flea,
</p>
<p>
As a manager you're probably already aware that chronic lateness is usually only a<br>
symptom of some bigger underlying problem. Situations like this are sensitive,<br>
extremely volatile, and prone to disaster if not handled by properly trained<br>
professionals. 
</p>
<p>
First, you should make a detailed account<i>in writing</i> of all the incidents as they happen.<br>
Then call both the local animal shelter and the police department, stating that you<br>
believe one of your employees is running an illegal dog-racing operation. Don't forget<br>
to mention that you think it's likely your underling will "do something" (make sure to<br>
use that exact phrase) with the dogs if he finds out that the authorities are after him.<br>
As you watch events unfold, it may seem like a painful and arduous process. But<br>
believe me, once it's all over, your employee will be so choked with emotion that he<br>
won't be able to find the words to thank you. 
</p>
