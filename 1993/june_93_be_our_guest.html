System 7.1 introduced<i>system enablers</i>to Macintosh system software architecture.<br>
Since their introduction on some of Apple's new machines, there's been some confusion<br>
about what system enablers are for, and developers have expressed interest in writing<br>
and using them. This column will shed some light on the subject. 
</p>
<p>
<b>THE BAD NEWS</b><br>
Even before beginning to describe them, we have to emphasize that system enablers<br>
are<i>system software,</i>designed and intended solely for the use of Apple Computer.<br>
Detailed descriptions of their design and use will not be released. Their functionality<br>
and implementation<i>will</i>change; any developers who try to decipher enablers and<br>
implement their own are warned that they will fail in future system releases. Do<i>not</i><br>
write your own enabler or modify a current one! 
</p>
<p>
Kinda harsh, huh? But we really mean it: the functionality of system enablers makes<br>
sense only for system software. Also, modifying or creating an enabler without fully<br>
understanding how one works could cause the enabler mechanism to fail silently. This<br>
could result in a machine that appears to be working correctly but does not have the<br>
full enabler functionality active, causing very hard-to-isolate crashes or other<br>
problems. 
</p>
<p>
<b>OK, SO WHAT ARE THEY?</b><br>
System enablers (which were called "gibblies" in early documentation and system<br>
development releases) replace the release strategy that Apple used in the past for<br>
minor system changes needed for new hardware. The old strategy was to release a new<br>
version of the system software, such as version 6.0.8 or 7.0.1. With enablers, the<br>
differences in hardware no longer require a new system release, but instead each new<br>
machine has its own enabler (if necessary) to make the system work for that<br>
hardware. 
</p>
<p>
This change was made for two reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating an enabler instead of a whole new system release reduces Apple's<br>
quality assurance and testing time. By creating an enabler, we're testing new<br>
code only on new machines; past machines aren't affected since the new<br>
enabler won't run on those machines. This also reduces your testing time as a<br>
third party, since you no longer have to install a new system release on all<br>
your older machines and test for compatibility; you know the system changes<br>
will affect only the newly released machines. </li>
<li>Enablers reduce user confusion and unnecessary upgrades. In the past,<br>
every time a machine was released, with its corresponding new software<br>
release, users of older machines were unsure whether they needed to upgrade<br>
to the new system. Many assumed that since it was newer, it was better. While<br>
this has been true occasionally, it usually isn't (upgrading from 7.0 to 7.0.1<br>
on a Macintosh IIcx, for example, gives the user nothing new).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Apple will continue to use system extensions or components when new functionality is<br>
being added across the product line, as with QuickTime and Macintosh Easy Open.<br>
Enablers just broaden the range of options for enhancing the user's environment. 
</p>
<p>
<b>HOW DO THEY WORK?</b><br>
Nope, no cheating -- we really won't be describing the internals of enablers. But here<br>
are some general rules about their behavior. 
</p>
<p>
An enabler is essentially an extension to the System file; from a programmatic<br>
standpoint it<i>is</i> the System file. The Resource Manager was changed slightly to<br>
recognize references to the System file (CurResFile(0), for example) as being<br>
references to the System file<i>and</i>the current enabler. The code or other resources<br>
included in the enabler file appear to actually reside in the System file. 
</p>
<p>
Any new machine may have a system enabler. The enabler will contain the<br>
system-level code necessary to implement changes required for that machine. A single<br>
enabler may be used for a family of machines, or a separate enabler may be created for<br>
each new machine. 
</p>
<p>
If there are multiple enablers in a machine's System Folder, the system will use<br>
only<i>one</i>of them. The system software (System file plus enabler) is responsible for<br>
arbitrating which enabler is used on a specific machine. It looks at the machine type<br>
it's currently running on, the machines that the enabler supports, and some<br>
enabler-internal applicability flags. Note that this is how the decision is currently<br>
made; as enablers are used for more machines and in different situations, more<br>
variables may be added to the decision process. 
</p>
<p>
<b>ENABLERS AND REFERENCE RELEASES</b><br>
A specific enabler may not stay around forever. Apple has announced its intention to<br>
have "reference releases" every year to 18 months; these are the system upgrades that<br>
all users will be encouraged to install. Some enablers may be rolled into a reference<br>
release, so a machine that needed an enabler for System 7.1 may not need one for<br>
System 8. This is not a hard and fast rule; some enablers may stay around forever,<br>
depending on the functionality they enable.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE BOTTOM LINE</b><br>
System enablers make everyone's life easier by encapsulating system changes for new<br>
machines in one place. But they are not for non-Apple use, and developers cannot<br>
implement them with any hope of long-term success. The safest path to take is not to<br>
think of enablers as separate files. An enabler<i>is</i>the system; when you encounter one on<br>
a machine, you're looking at the System file. The traditional methods (INITs, cdevs,<br>
components, and so on) are still the only supported ways for developers to extend<br>
system functionality. 
</p>
<h2>GIBBLY HISTORY</h2>
<p>
<b>BY CHRIS DEROSSI</b><br>
When system enablers were being designed, it was clear they were going to be a<br>
mechanism for extending the system. Engineers began calling them INITs, since they<br>
served much the same purpose. This caused some confusion with people who thought we<br>
really were talking about INITs, and issues were raised about possible conflicts with<br>
other INITs, loading order, and so on. (These issues don't apply to system enablers at<br>
all.)
</p>
<p>
It was obvious to me that we needed to change the name to differentiate system enablers<br>
from other types of system extension mechanisms. We couldn't use the term <i> extension</i><br>
because that was the public name for INITs. We couldn't use <i>addition</i> because that term<br>
already referred to things like QuickDraw GX and AOCE.
</p>
<p>
So, I decided to use a made-up word. I wanted a word that would be memorable and one<br>
that would sound funny when used in all seriousness by executives and upper<br>
management. Hence the name "gibblies."
</p>
<p>
The engineering documentation for gibblies states that the singular is "gibbly" and the<br>
plural is "gibblies." It also states that the "g" may be pronounced hard or soft<br>
depending on the speaker's preference. In practice, the hard form (as in "give")<br>
became the one used by those in the know.
</p>
<p>
There you have it. And, yes, it was very amusing to hear the made-up word being used<br>
all over the company in serious conversation.
