&nbsp;Dear Readers,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Nearly two years ago I was asked to join a team of Apple developer support people who<br>
would meet monthly to discuss a forthcoming Macintosh model that would be based on<br>
the new PowerPC (RISC) processor. Our goal was to ensure that developers receive the<br>
support they need to get started on this new computer, due to be introduced in 1994.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;It seemed a bit premature to me back then, but the time went faster than anyone would<br>
have imagined. Now I'm happy to finally have something to show for it in&nbsp;&nbsp;develop: an<br>
article to help you make the transition to this new stage in the life of the Macintosh.<br>
We hope to tear the engineers away from their programming long enough to be able to<br>
have a steady stream of articles on this subject in future issues.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The PowerPC processor-based Macintosh will be formally introduced roughly a decade<br>
after the introduction of the first Macintosh computer, which of course&nbsp;&nbsp;makes me wax<br>
nostalgic about what I was doing then at Apple: furiously finishing up&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside Macintosh<br>
on an&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple III, handing off chapters to Louella Pizzuti (later the founder of&nbsp;&nbsp;develop)<br>
to format them on the Macintosh in MacWrite &#174;. But most of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember looking<br>
forward to what I&nbsp;&nbsp;knew would be worldwide acceptance of -- no, excitement about! --<br>
our new computer.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The world is different now, as am I (we've both changed a lot in ten years), and I'm<br>
shorter on starry-eyed wonder and exclamation points than I was back then. But to<br>
quote an old TV personality (trivia question: who?): "I think you're gonna like this<br>
one." Talk about time flying by,&nbsp;&nbsp;this thing is fast. And it's still a Macintosh (which I'll<br>
always have a warm spot for in my heart no matter where I roam). It's a horse of a<br>
different color, but it's still a horse: a sleek, beautiful racehorse that should make us<br>
all winners. At least that's what I'm betting.
</p>

&nbsp;CAROLINE ROSE (AppleLink CROSE) got into technical writing because of a Math<br>
degree she didn't know what to do with. It landed her a job at Tymshare, where she<br>
wrote her first manual in pencil on paper, from which someone typed it on an IBM<br>
Selectric typewriter. But enough ancient history. Caroline's career at Apple began<br>
with&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside Macintosh and almost ended when she left to join NeXT, but she was smart<br>
enough to come back after five years and become the editor of develop. After putting<br>
each issue of&nbsp;&nbsp;develop to bed, Caroline likes to take off to someplace where she can<br>
forget about computers altogether. After this issue, she'll fulfill a dream she's had<br>
since the first time she looked at a globe as a child: she'll visit the Caroline islands.<br>
She'll stay with friends who live on a sailboat in primitive style (except for<br>
theircomputers!).*
