<b>DEBUGGING LESSON</b><br>
I just finished reading the debugging article in Issue 13 and I wondered if you had ever<br>
written up anything about this one:<br>
<p><pre>TYPE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LHdl = ^LPtr;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LPtr = ^LONGINT;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
{$S Fill_Seg}
PROCEDURE FillWithData(h:Handle);
BEGIN
h^^ := 23;
END;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
{$S Main}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PROCEDURE CanYouSpotTheProblem;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
VAR
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h :LHdl;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BEGIN
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h := LHdl(NewHandleClear(Size));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FillWithData(h);
END.</pre></p>
<p>
I call this "Routines That Don't Move Memory, Most of the Time." The problem comes<br>
about because of the hidden trap to LoadSeg. If all the code resources are preloaded,<br>
everything is OK. But if they aren't, the call to FillWithData may cause a memory<br>
move, and <b> h</b> is not locked. This is especially vile and nasty when, like us, you run in a<br>
very limited heap and unload your code frequently. I know that if you read <i> Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i> Volume II very carefully this is clear. But most of the interesting examples<br>
are the ones that are well documented but hard to catch.<br>
--Bob Tipton

<p>
<i>Thanks for the example. You're right, of course; calling routines in other, unloaded</i><br>
<i>segments can indeed move memory. This is documented in various places, but unless</i><br>
<i>you understand very clearly how your program occupies memory and how the Segment</i><br>
<i>Loader works, it's easy to overlook. Judicious use of a good heap scramble/purge will</i><br>
<i>catch this one before it catches you. Thanks for writing!</i><br>

<b>WHERE IN THE WORLD(SCRIPT)?</b><br>
I was looking for the WorldScript folder on Issue 12's Developer CD, "Wayne's<br>
GWorld" (Dev.CD Nov/Dec 92). According to the Contents Catalog stack, the<br>
WorldScript folder should be found in this path: Dev.CD Nov/Dec 92: System Software:<br>
WorldScript. But it's not there. I talked with a friend of mine who has the same CD, and<br>
he found the folder where it's supposed to be. We checked our CDs and found out that his<br>
says 564.6 MB on disc, 69.7 MB available, while mine says 555.5 MB on disc, 78.9<br>
MB available. What's going on?<br>
--Toru Kawate
</p>
<p>
P.S. Thank you for the fine journal and CD. I really enjoy them.
</p>
<p>
I received Issue 12 of <i> develop</i> with the Nov/Dec 1992 <i>Developer CD Series</i> disc. I<br>
enjoy the Developer CD but had the following trouble: I used the Contents Catalog on the<br>
CD and found the title"WorldScript." But I didn't find the folder at the pathname Dev.CD<br>
Nov/Dec 92: System Software: WorldScript.<br>
--Hirokazu Yaguchi
</p>
<p>
<i>At the last minute, WorldScript was pulled from the CD accompanying </i> develop<i>, but</i><br>
<i>there wasn't enough time to remove it from the Contents Catalog. WorldScript did,</i><br>
<i>however, remain on the Developer CD Series disc received monthly by members of</i><br>
<i>Apple's developer programs. The reason for this is tied in with why </i> develop <i>now has</i><br>
<i>its own CD, separate from the Developer CD Series disc; for details, see the editorial</i><br>
<i>on page 2.</i><br>

<b>WHEN TO EXPECT DEVELOP</b><br>
Sorry to disturb you, but because I've had problems with my subscription (two<br>
copies, no copies) -- which I've worked out, I think, with the DEV.SUBS people -- I'm<br>
wondering: Is there some sort of publication schedule available that will allow me to<br>
fret about this without disturbing anyone? ("Gee, it's two weeks past when this should<br>
be out . . . what am I missing out on?!")
</p>
<p>
Y'all are doing a fine job. Just be sure to run your issues through a Quark SmugCheck<br>
to keep the content only kinda wacky and smug without being too much that way.<br>
Thanks!<br>
--J. C. Burns
</p>
<p>
<i>I'm sorry you've had subscription problems, but I'm grateful that you pursued them</i><br>
<i>with DEV.SUBS rather than sending an AppleLink to CROSE or DEVELOP; many</i><br>
<i>developers make the mistake of contacting</i>develop <i>staff with these problems, but it's</i><br>
<i>really out of our realm. We are, however, doing our best to make the problems go</i><br>
<i>away.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>If you're located in the U.S., you should normally receive </i> develop <i>around the first of</i><br>
<i>March, June, September, and December. (If you're outside the U.S., it's hard to say,</i><br>
<i>because </i> develop <i>might need to wait for other materials to be merged into the same</i><br>
<i>mailing.)</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for the tip on SmugCheck; it's just what we need!</i><br>

<b>M.TN.DESIGNATIONS</b><br>
I notice you still add the numbers in references to Tech Notes. If dropping the numbers<br>
were such progress, that wouldn't be necessary. <i> And </i>the new alphanumeric reference<br>
codes are not used.
</p>
<p>
I'm a technical person who is used to abbreviations everywhere for conciseness.<br>
Besides, citing with full titles adds noise and a lot of repetitiveness.<br>
--Peter Fink
</p>
<p>
<i>We decided to include the old numbers in references to Tech Notes to help out those</i><br>
<i>people who like to use hard copy but still have the numbered versions. We'll stop doing</i><br>
<i>that once enough time has elapsed that we expect everyone will have the new,</i><br>
<i>unnumbered versions.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>For a variety of reasons, we decided not to include the new designations, such as</i><br>
<i>"M.PT.StandAloneCode," which identify the category/folder for each Note. We figured</i><br>
<i>people could find the Notes in the new file organization easily enough -- a Note on</i><br>
<i>QuickTime is in the QuickTime folder, right? But we've since realized that the</i><br>
<i>category isn't always obvious. So starting with this issue we refer to Notes by category</i><br>
<i>-- for example, "See the Macintosh (Platforms &amp; Tools) Technical Note, 'Stand-Alone</i><br>
<i>Code, ad nauseam.'"</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Many developers simply look up specific notes in the various Tech Note indexes, and</i><br>
<i>don't use the special designations at all. For those who do use them, they've been</i><br>
<i>improved to correlate more closely to the Notes' titles; for more on this and other</i><br>
<i>recent Tech Note improvements, see the box on this page.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>We're always open to suggestion, but so far you're the only one to mention this. If</i><br>
<i>others reading this reply have similar feedback, I hope they'll let us know.</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>

<h2>TECH NOTES AND Q&amp;AS: STATE OF THE UNION</h2>
<p>
<b>BY NEIL DAY, TECH NOTE AND SAMPLE CODE POOH-BAH</b>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
On the August 1992 <i>Developer CD Series</i> disc, the new organization of Macintosh<br>
Technical Notes made its debut. Since then, we've been listening for suggestions for<br>
improvement. The vast majority of the feedback has been positive, but you did point<br>
out a few areas for attention:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Better name correlation: Filenames, titles, and designations like<br>
"M.PT.StandAloneCode" needed to be more tightly bound to one another. The<br>
latest release fixes this problem; Tech Notes should be easier to find across<br>
the print and electronic versions.</li>
<li>Organization: Tech Notes are now organized alphabetically by title within<br>
each section. This was always the intention, but because filenames and titles<br>
didn't really match, things were a little haphazard.</li>
<li>Locating items in print: We've added the designation to the footer of each<br>
note, so you can quickly tell where you are as you flip through the pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Many of you have asked how to quickly locate the most recently written and updated<br>
Tech Notes. On the CD, aliases to the latest Notes can always be found in the "What's<br>
new on this CD?" folder. Using the Finder's View by Date option on the category folders<br>
is a handy way to see the most recent updates.
</p>
<p>
Also, please note that to group related information more logically, we've integrated<br>
Q&amp;As into the Tech Note library. Q&amp;As appear at the beginning of every section in the<br>
print version, and have the label "Essential" in the electronic version (or a different<br>
label if you've changed that label name on your system).
</p>
<p>
Many of you noticed that the Tech Note and Q&amp;A stacks have gone away: the Tech Note<br>
library is now available in Apple DocViewer format (as well as Microsoft Word files).<br>
You should find the searching and viewing in Apple DocViewer much more usable;<br>
please check it out.
</p>
<p>
These changes should make information much easier to find. As always, if you have<br>
suggestions or ideas for improving the Tech Note library, please let me know!
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Doug McKenna, the author of Resorcerer, for pointing out these problems.
