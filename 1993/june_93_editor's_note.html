<p>
&nbsp;Dear Readers,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I'd like to talk about a change that you've no doubt already noticed: printed <i> develop </i>is<br>
no longer accompanied by the <i>Developer CD Series </i> disc, but instead comes with its<br>
own CD as in days of old. Yes, we've come full circle: <i> develop </i>had its own CD for Issues<br>
1 through 7; then, starting with Issue 8, it was accompanied by the <i> Developer CD</i><br>
<i>Series</i> disc, which offered a superset of the contents of<i> develop</i>'s own CD. The<br>
Developer CD is actually a monthly CD that's mailed to members of Apple's developer<br>
programs and to subscribers to the Apple Developer Mailing (formerly the APDA<br>
Technical Information Mailing). At the time, it seemed simpler and more beneficial all<br>
around to just take every third Developer CD and make it the CD that accompanies <br>
<i>develop</i>.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;So why did we change back? Well, it became increasingly common for Developer CD<br>
contributors to submit valuable software (or documentation) that was considered<br>
appropriate for the "monthly mailing" but <i>not </i>for develop. The bargain low price of <br>
<i>develop </i>simply wasn't adequate to cover the value of the software. (An example that<br>
some of you noticed is WorldScript, which made it onto the monthly Developer CD but<br>
was pulled at the last minute from the Developer CD accompanying<i> develop</i>;&nbsp;&nbsp;see the<br>
Letters section.) Keeping valuable materials off the Developer CD or raising the price<br>
of a <i>develop </i>subscription would have been far less desirable than the option finally<br>
chosen, to restore <i>develop </i>to having its own disc that's a subset of the Developer CD.<br>
This new disc, which comes tucked into <i>develop </i>like a bookmark, is called the <i> develop</i><br>
<i>Bookmark</i> CD.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;This is not to say that <i> develop </i>isn't still a bargain! Even without the CD, it's a<br>
high-quality journal with articles that have passed rigorous review by engineers at<br>
Apple and are also enjoyable to read. Throw in a CD containing the code described in the<br>
articles, and already you're getting your money's worth (IMHO). But <i> develop</i>'s CD<br>
gives you even more than that: it contains all back issues and their code, Tech Notes,<br>
Sample Code from the Developer Support Center, <i> Apple Direct</i>, the Apple DocViewer<br>
application for electronic browsing, and assorted useful tools and documentation.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;On the <i>develop Bookmark</i> CD, you'll notice some things missing from past CDs you<br>
received with<i> develop</i>,&nbsp;&nbsp;primarily system software and <i> Inside Macintosh</i> (both old and<br>
new). If you still want to get these, consider subscribing to the Apple Developer<br>
Mailing so that you'll once again receive the monthly <i>Developer CD Series </i> disc, which<br>
now includes more than ever before. And keep an eye out for other products in the<br>
APDA catalog that may include what you want. (See the inside back cover for<br>
information about APDA.)
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;For those <i>develop </i>subscribers who receive the Developer CD monthly and don't care<br>
which disc<i> develop </i>comes with, you'll continue to have a beautiful printed copy of the<br>
journal that you can curl up with and easily pass along (think of it as "<i> develop</i><br>
unplugged"). The months that <i> develop </i>is published, the Technical Documentation<br>
edition of the Developer CD will be included in the monthly mailing. (See the March<br>
issue of <i> Apple Direct</i> for details on the new three-edition <i> Developer CD Series</i>.)
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;To clean the CD slate, so to speak, printed back issues of <i> develop </i>will now be<br>
accompanied by the Bookmark CD corresponding to this issue, rather than the<br>
Developer CDs they were originallypaired with. Remember,&nbsp;&nbsp;all <i>develop </i>code is kept<br>
up to date on the CD, and bugs fixed as necessary, so the latest CD is always the best one<br>
to refer to for code.
</p>
<p>
Since <i>develop </i>readers will have either the <i> develop Bookmark</i> CD or the <i> Developer CD</i><br>
<i>Series </i>disc, how does <i>develop </i>now refer to the disc containing the code it describes?<br>
After endless debate on this crucial issue, we decided on "this issue's CD." Clever,<br>
huh? We're proud of it.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of pride, I can't help but mention that <i> develop </i>won the Excellence award in<br>
the Society for Technical Communication's 1992 Northern California Technical<br>
Publications and Arts Competition. Please don't forget to let us know how we can make <br>
<i>develop </i>even better!

<p>
<b>CAROLINE ROSE </b>(AppleLink CROSE) was a programmer for seven years, until<br>
around the time "goto" went out of fashion. In those days, C was just the third letter of<br>
the alphabet and OOPS a loud interjection. Caroline's technical background came in<br>
handy when she was hired by Apple to work on <i> Inside Macintosh </i>Volumes I-III (may<br>
they rest in peace). What she did next after that turned out to be merely an<br>
interruption in her career at Apple, where she returned two years ago to edit <i>develop</i>.<br>
Speaking of "Oops," Caroline betrayed both her Italian heritage and her intense<br>
perfectionism by misspelling "mozzarella" in her bio in Issue 13; she received as<br>
punishment 30 lashes with a wet strand of spaghetti. Her next vacation will be spent<br>
on the Isle of Spice (trivia question: where?), and she is already brushing up on how<br>
to spell "callaloo" and "ylang-ylang."*
