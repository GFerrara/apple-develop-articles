<i>With the ascendancy of multimedia, 3-D shading and elaborate color backgrounds are</i><br>
<i>showing up in an increasing number of interface designs. But what happens when these</i><br>
<i>sophisticated interface elements must be displayed across multiple monitors of</i><br>
<i>different bit depths? This article explains how to use the DeviceLoop function to take</i><br>
<i>care of the device, clipping, and bit-depth logistics involved in multiple-monitor</i><br>
<i>displays.</i>
</p>

<p>
One of the great things about the Macintosh is its ability to support more than one<br>
monitor at a time. You can display windows in any active monitor or split a window --<br>
and the objects in it -- across several monitors at once. What's more, you can make an<br>
image adjust to the bit depth and other capabilities of each monitor it's displayed on, so<br>
that the visual interface looks as good as it possibly can on each of the devices attached<br>
to the computer. 
</p>
<p>
I recently worked on a project in which one of the goals was exactly that -- we wanted<br>
our application windows to look really good across multiple monitors and at any bit<br>
depth. The task was complicated by the fact that the interface was quite sophisticated<br>
graphically. To give our windows a distinctive, three-dimensional look, we used shaded<br>
color graphics. We filled the content area with background graphics, text, patterned<br>
and colored lines, and 3-D buttons. With the exception of our standard List Manager<br>
lists, all the window objects were drawn by our application program. Even the<br>
conventional scroll bar, close box, and zoom box were replaced by custom art drawn<br>
by the application, not the Window Manager. 
</p>
<p>
Displaying these complex windows across multiple monitors was obviously going to be<br>
a challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We knew that the Finder, for example, pulled it off -- whenever Finder<br>
windows span monitors of different bit depths, the parts of the window on each monitor<br>
are drawn to the individual monitor's depth. "If the Finder does it, so can we," I<br>
decided, although I actually knew very little about how to solve the problem. 
</p>
<h2>DEVICELOOP TO THE RESCUE</h2>
<p>
I bit the bullet. The search for ways to draw a window across multiple monitors led in<br>
a number of directions, all of them involving visible regions, clipping regions, and<br>
region-rect conversions. I asked a lot of people for advice, and while everyone was<br>
gracious in offering help, the job was looking complicated. Fortunately, one of the<br>
advice givers suggested that I check out the DeviceLoopfunction&nbsp;&nbsp;in<i>Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i>Volume VI. (I found out later that the advice giver was the author of the<br>
DeviceLoop function.)
</p>
<p>
When I looked up DeviceLoop in Volume VI, here's what I found: The DeviceLoop<br>
procedure searches all active screen devices, calling your drawing procedure<br>
whenever it encounters a screen that intersects your drawing region. You supply a<br>
handle to the region in which you wish to draw and a pointer to your drawing<br>
procedure. . . . If the DeviceLoop procedure encounters similar devices -- having the<br>
same pixel depth, black-and- white/color setting, and matching color table seeds -- it<br>
makes only one call to your drawing procedure, pointing to the first such device<br>
encountered. 
</p>
<p>
This sounded exactly like what we were looking for. The Window Manager itself uses<br>
DeviceLoop to display window components on a variety of monitors. Since we were<br>
drawing our own windows, DeviceLoop was clearly what we needed. 
</p>
<p>
Here's what DeviceLoop looks like in C:
</p>
<p><pre>pascal void DeviceLoop (RgnHandle drawingRgn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DeviceLoopDrawingProcPtr drawingProc,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long userData, DeviceLoopFlags flags);</pre></p>
<p>
The drawingRgn parameter is a handle to the region that will be drawn in (usually a<br>
window's visRgn). The drawingProc parameter is a pointer to your drawing routine<br>
(see below). The userData parameter is a long that gets passed to your drawing<br>
routine. Finally, the flags parameter controls how devices are grouped before your<br>
drawing routine is called. (Pass 0 for the default behavior -- grouping similar<br>
devices together. See the description in<i>Inside Macintosh</i>for other possible values.)
</p>
<p>
The drawing routine needs to be declared as follows:
</p>
<p><pre>pascal void MyDrawProc (short depth, short deviceFlags,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GDHandle targetDevice, long userData);</pre></p>
<p>
Here the depth parameter is the depth of the device you're currently drawing on. The<br>
deviceFlags parameter is a copy of the device's gdFlags, targetDevice is a handle to the<br>
device, and userData is whatever you passed to DeviceLoop. 
</p>
<p>
DeviceLoop works like this: Each time your drawing routine is called, the current<br>
port's visRgn will have been set to the intersection of your drawing region and some<br>
screen device. DeviceLoop passes the drawing characteristics of the particular screen<br>
it's working on to the drawing routine, which can then make use of them -- for<br>
instance, by drawing to the appropriate bit depth. In short, DeviceLoop takes care of<br>
all the device, clipping, and bit-depth logistics, while all you have to do is draw. 
</p>
<h2>USING DEVICELOOP IN AN OBJECT-ORIENTED WORLD</h2>
<p>
In our application, we had to draw not only the contents of the window, but also the<br>
window itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True to our object-oriented design, we created classes for all the<br>
interface objects. These classes included a TArt class for backgrounds, graphics, and<br>
3-D button objects; a TLine class for lines; a TTxt class for black-and-white text; and<br>
a TBkg class for backgrounds for the text. Although we used DeviceLoop for drawing<br>
objects in every class except the text classes, the heart of the process is best<br>
illustrated by our use of DeviceLoop for TArt objects. 
</p>
<p>
The graphics for TArt objects were stored as PICT resources. To give the best possible<br>
image, the interface designer created an 8-bit-deep PICT for display depths of 8 bits<br>
or deeper. For all other display depths and CPUs without Color QuickDraw, she created<br>
a 1-bit-deep, black-and-white PICT. We could have let the Macintosh use the 8-bit<br>
PICT for all drawing -- color and black-and- white -- and, with dithering, the<br>
results would have been pretty good. But since we had our own hand-designed, 1-bit<br>
version of the PICT, DeviceLoop was a better solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our window object&nbsp;&nbsp;kept track<br>
of all the interface objects that it needed to draw. When an update event was received,<br>
the document object told the window object to draw. Specifically, our<br>
BeginUpdate/EndUpdate function called a particular drawing routine for each of the<br>
objects. Each object, in turn, called DeviceLoop with our DrawProc callback, which<br>
contained the actual drawing code for that object. Figure 1 shows this strategy. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 1</b> An Inefficient Way to Incorporate DeviceLoop
</p>
<p>
We used this DeviceLoop-within-each-object's-drawing-procedure approach until<br>
someone pointed out how inefficient it was to call DeviceLoop for every interface<br>
object. We realized that it would be much better to call DeviceLoop once and have the<br>
drawing procedure that we passed to it decide which object had to be drawn. We wound<br>
up with a single DeviceLoop call in the window's BeginUpdate/EndUpdate function, as<br>
shown in Figure 2. The use of a single DeviceLoop call in the window object really<br>
streamlined the design.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 2</b> A Better Way to Call DeviceLoop
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
One problem we encountered was that the compiler balked whenever we referenced our<br>
drawing routine (called DrawProc) in the DeviceLoop parameter list. We even<br>
included the scope -- TWin::DrawProc -- and that didn't help. The breakthrough came<br>
when we made DrawProc static.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, changing it to static caused another<br>
problem: the compiler choked when we referenced<b>this</b> within DrawProc. We forgot<br>
that static functions can't reference nonstatic member variables. (You C++ aficionados<br>
are probably smiling, but we recent converts must struggle at first.) We couldn't use<br>
static variables, however, because each of our objects required its own variables.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Thus, to access an object's variables, we had to pass the window object pointer in the<br>
userData parameter of the DeviceLoop function.
</p>
<h2>AN EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>
The<i> Developer CD Series</i>disc contains a sample application that shows how we used<br>
DeviceLoop for TArt objects in our interface. The application, DeviceLoopInDrag,<br>
displays a window that can be dragged between monitors of different bit depths. Figure<br>
3 shows this window spanning a grayscale and a black-and-white monitor. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Excerpts from the DeviceLoopInDrag source code follow. First there's the update<br>
function that's called whenever the window needs to be redrawn. It just calls the<br>
drawing procedure for the window object (TWin). 
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/169.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3</b> DeviceLoop in Action
</p>
<p><pre>// TDoc::DoUpdate
// Document object.
// Entry for update event action.
void
TDoc::DoUpdate()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BeginUpdate(this-&gt;fDocWindow);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this-&gt;fWinObj-&gt;Draw();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EndUpdate(this-&gt;fDocWindow);
}</pre></p>
<p>
&nbsp;The window's drawing procedure does little more than set up and call DeviceLoop.<br>
Notice that we're passing the reference to the current window object --<b>this</b> -- in<br>
DeviceLoop's userData parameter, as described earlier. Since we want the default<br>
DeviceLoop behavior, we set the flags to 0. 
</p>
<p><pre>// TWin::Draw
// Window object.
// Within BeginUpdate/EndUpdate.
void
TWin::Draw()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Have DeviceLoop manage the drawing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Pass the window object in userData.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;userData = (long)this;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DeviceLoopFlags&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flags = 0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GrafPtr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myPort;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetPort(&amp;myPort);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DeviceLoop(myPort-&gt;visRgn, TWin::DrawProc, userData, flags);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Draw the stuff we don't need DeviceLoop for.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// We tell the subview to take care of that.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this-&gt;fView-&gt;Draw();
};</pre></p>
<p>
Next, theTWin drawing procedure is the callback procedure that DeviceLoop invokes to<br>
coordinate the drawing of each of the elements on the screen.
</p>
<p><pre>// TWin::DrawProc
// Called by DeviceLoop.
// A static function. Must be in a resident segment, locked and
// unpurgeable. Because it's static, it can't access object member
// variables directly. We use the window object passed in userData
// to access its member variables.
#pragma segment Main
pascal void
TWin::DrawProc(short depth, short /*deviceFlags*/,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GDHandle hTargetDevice, long userData)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Get the window object from userData.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TWin* theWinObject = (TWin*) userData;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Use depth of 1 if we have a computer without Color QuickDraw.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depth = (hTargetDevice==NULL)?1:depth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Draw our objects.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theWinObject-&gt;fBackground-&gt;Draw(depth);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theWinObject-&gt;fLogo-&gt;Draw(depth);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theWinObject-&gt;fText-&gt;Draw(depth);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theWinObject-&gt;fButton-&gt;Draw(depth);
};</pre></p>
<p>
Finally, here's the actual TArt::Draw function, used for various items in the window.<br>
Based on the bit-depth parameter passed to it, the Draw function decides whether to<br>
use the black-and-white or the color version of its PICT.
</p>
<p><pre>// TArt::Draw
// All art objects (PICTs) are drawn here. This is where we
// distinguish between B&amp;W or color renderings of TArt objects.
// The B&amp;W rendering has a resource ID that's kBWOffset larger
// than its color counterpart value.
void
TArt::Draw(short depth)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Don't draw empty art.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(this-&gt;fPictID==0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PicHandle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hPict;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(depth&lt;8)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Use B&amp;W PICT.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hPict = (PicHandle) GetResource('PICT',
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this-&gt;fPictID+kBWOffset);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Use color PICT.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hPict = (PicHandle) GetResource('PICT', this-&gt;fPictID);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(hPict)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rect&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theDrawRect;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this-&gt;GetDrawRect(theDrawRect);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HLock((Handle) hPict);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DrawPicture(hPict, &amp;theDrawRect);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HUnlock((Handle) hPict);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
};</pre></p>
<h2>SUMMING UP</h2>
<p>
How did we wind up feeling about DeviceLoop? After we first discovered it, our<br>
tendency was to use it everywhere. We even used it to call a drawing routine that<br>
always drew in black and white, no matter what the bit depth. We later stripped this<br>
use out of the interface because it offered no advantage and added extra code. 
</p>
<p>
One concern we had was that performance would degrade to an intolerable level as we<br>
added objects to be drawn. To see what would happen, the mischievous test engineer for<br>
our project devised a case with 99 separate TArt objects in the same window.<br>
Predictably, the 99 objects weren't displayed all at once. While you can expect some<br>
lag between the appearance of first object in a window and the last, however, the<br>
drawing time when you use DeviceLoop is really very short, well within user<br>
tolerance. 
</p>
<p>
All in all, our design team was very pleased with DeviceLoop. We were glad to have<br>
found such an easy way to solve the problem of displaying interface objects on<br>
monitors of different bit depths. The interface designer got the look she wanted, and we<br>
were able to accomplish the job with a minimum of hassle and a minimum of code. This<br>
was one challenge that left everyone happy.
