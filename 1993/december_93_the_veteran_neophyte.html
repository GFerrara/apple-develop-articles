<h2>THE VETERAN NEOPHYTE</h2>

<p>
I've just returned from a really long vacation. For six weeks I didn't touch a single<br>
computer. (Well, that's not strictly true; I did stroke many a touch-screen on<br>
information kiosks or ticket machines, but you get the idea.) The first time after my<br>
return that I grabbed the mouse of a live Macintosh there was a brief instant -- just a<br>
single, sharp, fleeting moment -- when I felt the magic again. 
</p>
<p>
Can you remember the first time you got to play with a working Macintosh? Were you<br>
amazed -- I mean really astounded -- as I was? Did you: Peek under the mouse to see<br>
what was there? Click and drag all over the place just to watch things happen? Drag a<br>
file into a folder and then immediately open the folder to see if the file was really<br>
there? Create a nest of new folders deep enough to get bored, just to see if it would<br>
work? Try every combination of bold, outline, shadow, italic, and underline? 
</p>
<p>
I'm betting that the fundamental reason you're interested in programming the<br>
Macintosh is because of that magic. I know this isn't true for everyone out there (some<br>
of you -- gasp -- probably do it for the money!), but I suspect it's true for most of<br>
you, or at least it was when you started. Maybe you wanted to make a little of that<br>
magic yourself. Maybe you just wanted to peek behind the curtain to see how it was<br>
done. Or maybe you wanted (as I did) to find out where the magic came from, to hunt<br>
down its source. One of the problems with that kind of techno-magic, though, is that<br>
the more you learn about it and the more you use it, the more it fades away. 
</p>
<p>
So here's the next question: When was the <i>last</i> time you felt the magic? If you're like<br>
me, the magic of the Macintosh interface has been completely subsumed by everyday<br>
familiarity. It's become a part of everyday life, like matches, or light bulbs, or TV.<br>
I'm sure that when matches were still new, striking one and making fire was an<br>
amazing thing. I'll bet people used up whole boxes of matches, striking them one by<br>
one, just to see it happen. But matches are no longer special; their magic has become<br>
cheap and commonplace and has therefore ceased to be magic at all. People don't light<br>
matches for the thrill anymore (pyromaniacs excepted); they use them to light<br>
something else -- matches have become a means, not an end. Similarly, we don't<br>
marvel anymore at the fact that just by flipping a switch we can make an entire room<br>
as bright as day, banishing forever the night; we think instead about what we want to<br>
do tonight. We don't marvel anymore that moving pictures and sounds can be plucked<br>
out of the air (or out of a cable, these days) and made to show up on a box in our<br>
homes; we think instead about what's on. 
</p>
<p>
This is probably a necessary and inevitable step in a culture's acceptance and<br>
assimilation of a new technology: people stop marveling at the fact that they have a new<br>
ability, and begin simply to <i>use</i> that ability. That period when new technologies still<br>
feel like magic is also the period when a culture is adjusting itself to the technology<br>
and being transformed by it. By the time a new technology has been fully integrated<br>
into society, it's taken for granted, the magic exhausted and the transformation<br>
complete. 
</p>
<p>
So how does this apply to computers? Is the magic from computers all used up? Have<br>
they been fully assimilated by human society and finished their transformational<br>
work? Are they now taken forgranted and just a part of the background noise of modern<br>
life? In the words of my mom when I asked her (at age 11) if I could get a tattoo on my<br>
chest: Hell, no. 
</p>
<p>
Particular <i>manifestations</i> of computers have become a part of daily life for many<br>
people: cash machines, video games, bar code readers at markets, and so on. These are<br>
computers, but they're masked -- the true nature of the machine is obscured by a<br>
task-specific facade. Even the relatively small number of people who use "real"<br>
computers in their everyday lives use them for only a few tasks (word processing,<br>
graphics editing, number crunching, and game playing are common -- somehow recipe<br>
filing never caught on). So they're really just using two or three specific, task-<br>
oriented applications. And yes, these particular uses of computers have become<br>
mundane to those who use them: writers use word processors without blinking,<br>
accountants use spreadsheets without a hint of awe. 
</p>
<p>
But I'm not sure whether computers <i>as computers</i> can ever be fully integrated into<br>
society. They're too slippery, too prolific, too, well, <i>protean</i>. (Protean: able to take on<br>
new forms easily, after Proteus, a sea god in Greek mythology who could change his<br>
shape at will.) Just when we get used to them in one guise, they blur and shift and<br>
suddenly they're something else, something new, something magical all over again. 
</p>
<p>
And that's where programmers come in. We're the ones who get to cause that shift.<br>
We're the ones who get to craft new faces for the machine, like mad, happy mask<br>
makers. We're the ones that get tomake the magic.&nbsp;&nbsp;We get closer than anyone else to<br>
tasting the real flavor of computers -- their malleability and chameleon-like talent<br>
for taking on new forms -- but it's still only a taste, and the price is outrageous.<br>
Making magic turns out to be nothing but hard, grungy work. Being a wizard looks<br>
great from the outside, but there's a downside most people don't see: to create the<br>
magic, you need to spend inordinately huge amounts of time doing completely unmagical<br>
things, and even worse, you have to give up experiencing the magic for yourself. It's<br>
like sleight of hand: it looks like magic to the audience, but to the conjurer it's not<br>
magic at all. Learning that kind of magic means spending countless hours alone in front<br>
of a mirror, practicing the same moves over and over and over until they're automatic<br>
and can be made without even thinking. By that time any residual magic has been<br>
completely wrung out of it. 
</p>
<p>
Like brain researchers who set off to find the source of human consciousness and end<br>
up studying the function of some enzyme in sea slugs, programmers often set off to find<br>
the source of the magic and end up writing device drivers. There's a valuable lesson<br>
there, one that took me years to learn: the magic isn't part of the machine at all. You<br>
can follow the computer's workings right down to the bottom, and what you find is a<br>
boringly predictable mechanism as devoid of magic as a meat grinder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's like trying<br>
to find musical beauty by closely examining a CD: all you can find is a series of rough<br>
pits in a reflective surface, and there's no indication whatever that those pits could<br>
contain something sublime.
</p>
<p>
So where does the magic come from? The answer's obvious, once you stop to think<br>
about it: it comes from people. It turns out that computers don't possess any magic of<br>
their own, they're just very, very good containers for human magic. The computer is<br>
simply a shell, albeit one that's infinitely malleable. The people who shape the shell,<br>
who tell the computer what to be, are the real source of the magic. I guess I should've<br>
known.

<b>DAVE JOHNSON</b> wants to know: is he the only one who does watch-cursor push-ups<br>
during time-consuming Macintosh operations? First you find a horizontal black line<br>
(they're everywhere: window frames, folder icons, buttons, even the progress bar<br>
itself), then you put the watch cursor just above it, so that the bottom edge of the<br>
watchband overlaps the horizontal line by one pixel. Now carefully move the cursor up<br>
and down by one pixel, and there you have it -- watch- cursor push-ups! You can do<br>
pull-ups too! Amaze your friends! *
