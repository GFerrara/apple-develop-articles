&nbsp;Dear Readers,
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;develop </i>does it again! We're thrilled to announce that we've won another Excellence<br>
award, this time in the 1993 International Technical Publications Competition,<br>
sponsored by the Society for Technical Communication.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Some things that are worth noting in this issue:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We're very happy to finally have a female author. Welcome to Deanna<br>
Thomas; may she be the first in a long line.</li>
<li>We've added a strange new column called "View From the Ledge"; please let<br>
us know what you think of this irreverent (or is that "irrelevant"?) addition.</li>
<li>We're temporarily without a Print Hints or Graphical Truffles column.<br>
But there's a lot of information about printing and graphics in our three<br>
QuickDraw GX articles. </li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;Finally, here are two changes that have happened as a result of your feedback:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tech Notes are numbered again, this time within each category of Note.  <br>
References in<i>develop</i>will include the new number after the category; for<br>
example, we might refer you to the Macintosh Technical Note "Fond of FONDs"<br>
(Text 21). With this issue we finally stop giving the former number of a Tech<br>
Note, as in "(formerly #91)"; those old numbers are long gone.</li>
<li>New<i>Inside Macintosh</i>is now on the<i>develop Bookmark</i>CD. It was painfully<br>
missing from Issue 14's CD, but we have seen the error of our ways and have<br>
quickly rectified the situation. </li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;Please keep letting us know what you want; it pays! 
</p>
<p>

<p>
<b>&nbsp;CAROLINE ROSE </b>(AppleLink CROSE) has written and edited more technical<br>
documentation than she cares to remember. In past work lives, she was also a<br>
programmer and (gasp!) a manager. She's worked for Tymshare, Apple, NeXT, and<br>
Apple, in that order. But no previous job compares to the variety and fun she enjoys as<br>
editor of <i> develop</i>. Caroline is still raving about the great time she had at the<br>
Worldwide Developers Conference in May. We suspect the highlight was when a<br>
developer asked her to sign his copy of <i> develop</i> -- or was it when she took the Karaoke<br>
dare at the WWDC party? Recent delights outside of work include singing like a<br>
wannabe Bonnie Raitt at jam sessions with her friends and listening to tapes of John<br>
Prine and Richard Thompson from an incredible music festival she attended in a<br>
mountain meadow.*
