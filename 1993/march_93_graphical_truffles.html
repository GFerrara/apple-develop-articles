</p>
<p>
No part of the Macintosh graphics environment is more feared, hated, or<br>
misunderstood than the Palette Manager. The Developer Support Center gets many<br>
questions about it from people who don't have any idea how to get it to do what they<br>
want. We've seen many people just give up on the Palette Manager completely and<br>
instead use lower-level routines that are much more difficult to use but easier to<br>
understand quickly.
</p>
<p>
The Palette Manager is actually very simple. It has no complicated heuristics that only<br>
rocket scientists can understand. In this column, we'll show how the Palette Manager<br>
gets its job done, and we'll talk about a couple of issues that you'll have to deal with to<br>
make your palettes do what you want them to do. You'll see that the Palette Manager is<br>
both easy to understand and a very useful part of the Macintosh Toolbox. 
</p>
<p>
Before you read this column, it would be a good idea to read the Palette Manager<br>
chapter (Chapter 20) of<i>Inside Macintosh</i>Volume VI, which lays down the terminology<br>
that we'll use here. 
</p>
<p>
<b>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PALETTE IS ACTIVATED</b><br>
The critical job that the Palette Manager does is activate a palette. This happens<br>
whenever you call SetPalette or ActivatePalette for the frontmost window and<br>
whenever a window that has a palette is activated. When a palette is activated, the<br>
Palette Manager loads the palette colors into the screen's color table. How it goes about<br>
doing this is determined by the usage mode of each entry in the palette.
</p>
<p>
You indicate an entry's usage mode by setting a flag in its usage field. There are four<br>
usage modes: pmCourteous, pmTolerant, pmAnimated, and pmExplicit. You can choose a<br>
separate usage mode or combination of usage modes for each entry in a palette, or you<br>
can give all the entries the same usage mode. Let's take a look at what each usage mode<br>
is good for and what effect each one has when a palette is activated. 
</p>
<p>
<b>pmCourteous. </b>The pmCourteous usage mode enables you to replace RGBColor records<br>
in your code with single integers. Thus, having a palette of courteous colors gives you<br>
an alternative way to specify foreground and background colors. This is great for<br>
localizers who might need to change the colors in your program to something more<br>
meaningful in other countries, and it's great for you if you feel like changing a color<br>
without recompiling.
</p>
<p>
Activating a palette of courteous colors simply tells the Palette Manager to use your<br>
window's palette as a sort of lookup table. When your window is the current port and<br>
you call PmForeColor or PmBackColor with a palette index, the Palette Manager<br>
simply retrieves the color in your window's palette at that index and uses it for any<br>
subsequent drawing to that window. Courteous colors never change the screen's color<br>
table -- they get mapped to the closest colors already available there. 
</p>
<p>
Here's an example: Without the Palette Manager, you would draw a green oval in a<br>
window by setting up an RGBColor record with a red component of 0, a green<br>
component of 65,535, and a blue component of 0 and passing this record to<br>
RGBForeColor; then you would call FrameOval. To change the oval to blue, you would<br>
modify your RGBColor record in your source code and recompile your program. Now,<br>
suppose instead you brought in the Palette Manager by setting up a palette resource<br>
(resource type 'pltt') that contained one courteous entry -- green -- with an index of<br>
0. In your code, you would call PmForeColor(0) instead of RGBForeColor with green.<br>
When you called FrameOval, the oval would be drawn in green. To change the color to<br>
blue, you would just use ResEdit to modify the green entry in your 'pltt' resource to<br>
blue.&nbsp;&nbsp;So calling PmForeColor for a&nbsp;&nbsp;courteous palette entry is just like calling<br>
RGBForeColor, but instead of supplying the RGB components, you simply pass an index<br>
into the palette, where the index points to the color's RGB components (see Figure 1). 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;pmTolerant. </b>The pmTolerant usage mode is used when you want to be sure that a<br>
specific set of colors is available to the screens that your window is on. It's a bummer<br>
to draw a rainbow in a window on a screen that another application has removed all the<br>
greens and yellows from. You need a palette of tolerant colors to assert your<br>
application's right to the colors it needs to display its images optimally. With such a<br>
palette, you can change the colors in a screen's color table to ones that you want. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Before we look at how a palette of tolerant colors is activated, realize that Color<br>
QuickDraw always wants white in the first entry of a screen's color table and black in<br>
the last. To enforce this rule, Color QuickDraw protects these two entries from being<br>
changed to other colors. That means a palette of tolerant colors can change all the<br>
colors of a screen's color table except two. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;When a palette of tolerant colors is activated, the Palette Manager checks each entry<br>
in the palette and associates it with an entry in the screen's color table. Let's say we<br>
have a palette with three entries -- bright green, black, and dark yellow -- attached<br>
to a window on a 16-color screen. All three palette entries are tolerant, with a<br>
tolerance of 0. The Palette Manager does the following: 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;It checks the first entry in<br>
the palette, bright green, and searches the screen's color table for the same bright<br>
green. It finds that color near the middle of the color table, and so associates palette<br>
entry 0 with this existing bright green entry in the color table.&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;It searches the<br>
screen's color table for the second entry in the palette, black. It finds it at the very<br>
end, so palette entry 1 corresponds to entry 15 of the color table.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;It searches the<br>
screen's color table for dark yellow. There isn't one, so it chooses a color table entry<br>
to change to dark yellow. It can't choose the black or the white entry because they're <br>
protected and can't be changed, and it can't change the bright green entry because that<br>
entry is already associated with entry 0 of the palette. So it chooses one of the other<br>
color table entries and changes it to dark yellow. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 1</b> Alternative Ways to Specify a Foreground Color
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Because the color table has been changed, the Palette Manager makes sure that other<br>
windows are redrawn, just in case they were drawn using the color table entry that<br>
was changed to dark yellow. It does this by sending update events to all windows as soon<br>
as the palette is activated. If no color table changes were needed, the Palette Manager<br>
doesn't bother doing this. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Once our three-entry palette has been activated, we can call PmForeColor, passing it<br>
0, 1, or 2 to draw objects in bright green, black, or dark yellow, respectively. In<br>
fact, we could call RGBForeColor, passing it bright green, black, or dark yellow<br>
RGBColor records, and they would use the same colors that our palette loaded into the<br>
screen's color table. Figure 1 applies to palettes of tolerant colors as well as palettes<br>
of courteous colors.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are more palette entries than will fit in the screen's<br>
color table, the Palette Manager associates each palette entry with a color table entry<br>
until no more color table entries are available and then interprets the rest of the<br>
palette entries as courteous. For example, let's say a 20-entry palette is activated on a<br>
16-color screen, where each palette entry is pmTolerant with a tolerance of 0 and<br>
neither black nor white is in the palette. Beginning with the first palette entry, the<br>
Palette Manager associates each entry with a color table entry. The 15th palette entry<br>
can't be associated with any color table entry because the black and white entries are<br>
protected from changes and all 14 other entries have already been associated with<br>
palette entries. So the 15th palette entry and all entries beyond it are simply treated<br>
as courteous colors. 
</p>
<p>
<b>pmAnimated. </b>On indexed devices, the pmAnimated usage mode is used to do color table<br>
animation, which gives you smooth, fast visual effects simply by changing the colors<br>
in your screen's color table very quickly. You don't have to redraw anything to see this<br>
animation; you just use the Palette Manager to change the interpretation of the colors<br>
of your existing image. This is great for games and fast controls for image processing<br>
applications. On direct devices, animated entries are treated as courteous entries. 
</p>
<p>
Like pmTolerant entries, each pmAnimated palette entry is associated with an entry in<br>
a screen's color table when the palette is activated, and the colors in the palette are put<br>
into the screen's color table. But changing color table entries for color animation<br>
changes everything on the screen that uses those same color table entries, like the<br>
desktop or window frames. That's usually not what we want, so the Palette Manager<br>
forces everything outside the window to be redrawn without the colors that are being<br>
used for color animation -- those colors are off limits. In fact, the only way to use<br>
those colors is to call PmForeColor or PmBackColor for an animated palette entry and<br>
then draw some QuickDraw object. Remember, the big difference between tolerant and<br>
animated colors is that color table entries that are used for tolerant colors can be used<br>
by anyone, but animated color table entries are used only by objects drawn in the<br>
palette's window after a call to PmForeColor or PmBackColor. 
</p>
<p>
Let's use our three-entry palette as an example again, but this time assume that each<br>
entry is animated. The Palette Manager first takes the bright green entry, picks a<br>
color table entry on the screen, and changes it to bright green. It doesn't matter if<br>
there's already a bright green in the color table. As usual, the Palette Manager avoids<br>
the black and white entries at either end of the color table. It then picks another color<br>
table entry and puts black into it, and does the same for the dark yellow entry. If you<br>
call PmForeColor(0) and draw an object, it's drawn in bright green. But if you call<br>
RGBForeColor for bright green and draw an object, it doesn't use the bright green<br>
that's been defined as animated. Instead, it uses the closest color to bright green<br>
available, aside from any color table entries that have been defined as animated. 
</p>
<p>
<b>pmExplicit. </b>The pmExplicit usage mode is rarely used alone, and there's not much to<br>
it beyond what's described in the Palette Manager chapter of<i>Inside Macintosh</i>Volume<br>
VI. We'll discuss in the next section the more interesting case of using pmExplicit<br>
along with the other usage modes. 
</p>
<p>
<b>ARE BLACK AND WHITE NEEDED IN A PALETTE?</b><br>
When attaching a palette to a window, the Palette Manager works in a way that affects<br>
whether you should store black and white in the palette. We'll outline the way it works<br>
in two different categories.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first category applies to palettes containing the same<br>
number of entries as the screen's color table, and the second category applies to<br>
palettes containing fewer entries than the screen's color table. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Same number of entries in palette and color table. </b> If the palette contains the<br>
same number of entries as the screen's color table, black and white should be stored in<br>
the palette. If these two entries aren't stored in the palette, the Palette Manager will<br>
ignore two entries in the palette when loading the palette colors into the screen's color<br>
table, to avoid overwriting the color table's black and white entries. The Palette<br>
Manager will decide which palette entries to ignore based on the usage field for each<br>
palette entry.
</p>
<p>
As an example, let's take the case of a palette all of whose entries are defined as<br>
pmTolerant + pmExplicit. Because the pmExplicit flag tells the Palette Manager to<br>
store each palette entry in its respective index in the screen's color table, the choice<br>
of which palette entry to ignore is fairly straightforward. The colors stored at the<br>
first and last entry of the palette correspond to the protected entries in the screen's<br>
color table, so these entries will be ignored.
</p>
<p>
In the case of a palette containing entries not defined with the pmExplicit flag set, the<br>
decision of which two palette colors to ignore can seem somewhat random. This is<br>
because the decision is based on the current distribution of the palette entries in the<br>
screen's color table, where the distribution is derived from the tolerance values of the<br>
palette entries and the existing colors in the screen's color table before the palette was<br>
activated. 
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose we have a 16-entry palette and a 4-bit screen color table as<br>
shown in Figure 2 (we've used the default color table). Figure 3 shows how the<br>
screen's color table will look in two different cases when the palette of the frontmost<br>
window has been activated. In these figures, the explicit entries are distributed<br>
sequentially in the screen's color table, whereas the nonexplicit entries are scattered<br>
throughout the color table.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 3</b> The Color Table With the Palette of the&nbsp;&nbsp;Frontmost Window Active
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
For the explicit entries, we see that the first and last entries of the palette are not<br>
loaded into the screen's color table, to protect the color table's white and black entries.<br>
However, for the nonexplicit entries, the two palette colors ignored aren't necessarily<br>
the first and last entries of the palette. When determining where the nonexplicit<br>
palette entries should be stored in the color table, the Palette Manager first checks to<br>
see which colors in the screen's color table already match those in the palette. If<br>
there's a match within the specified tolerance, that palette entry is stored at the index<br>
of the matching color in the screen's color table. 
</p>
<p>
And one other thing: When multiple nonexplicit palette entries match (within the<br>
specified tolerance) the same color in the screen's color table, all those palette entries<br>
are stored at the same index in the color table. This means that only one slot in the<br>
color table is needed rather than as many slots as there are palette entries. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Fewer entries in the palette. </b>Now, if the window's palette contains fewer entries<br>
than the screen's color table, the palette entries' usage field plays a large part in<br>
determining whether black and white should be included in the palette. The reason for<br>
this is similar to the previous case for nonexplicit entries.
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 4</b> Another Example Palette and Color Table

<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 5</b> The Color Table With the Palette of the Frontmost Window Active
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;If all the entries in a palette are defined without the pmExplicit flag set, the presence<br>
of black and white in the palette isn't as critical, since the palette entries will likely<br>
be scattered throughout the screen's color table while avoiding the protected white and<br>
black colors stored in the first and last slots of the screen's color table. Since there<br>
are fewer palette entries than color table entries, we needn't worry about palette<br>
entries getting ignored. So in this case, creating a palette without a black entry or a<br>
white entry is perfectly fine as long as there are enough slots in the screen's color<br>
table to hold all the palette entries and the two protected colors. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;However, if the palette entries are all defined with the pmExplicit flag set, there's a<br>
good chance that one of the palette's entries will be ignored. And the palette entry that<br>
does get ignored will usually be the first entry in the palette, because this entry<br>
shares the same index as the protected white entry in the screen's color table. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;For example, suppose we have a 192-entry palette and an 8-bit screen color table as<br>
shown in Figure 4 (again, we've used the default color table). Figure 5 shows how the<br>
screen's color table will look in two different cases when the palette of the frontmost<br>
window has been activated. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Again, the explicit entries are distributed sequentially in the screen's color table,<br>
starting with the first entry in the color table. Because the first entry in the screen's<br>
color table is protected from being overwritten, the first entry in the palette is<br>
ignored. But in the nonexplicit case, the entries are distributed somewhat differently.<br>
Depending on what colors are already in the screen's color table, the nonexplicit<br>
entries can be stored anywhere throughout the color table. And in this example, since<br>
there are clearly more slots in the screen's color table than needed by the palette<br>
entries, all the colors in the palette appear in the color table; none are ignored. So<br>
again in this case, including black and white in the palette really isn't necessary. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;WHERE TO PUT BLACK AND WHITE IN THE PALETTE</b><br>
We've seen how the way the Palette Manager works can affect whether you decide to<br>
store black and white in your palette. In all the instances we mentioned, the positions<br>
of the black entry and white entry were always the same: white first and black last.<br>
However, in certain cases, you may not want to position white first and black last.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;In the case where you'd like to create just one palette to handle devices at multiple bit<br>
depths, the black and white entries should be stored as the first two colors in the<br>
palette. This ensures that the two colors used on a 1-bit device are present. Likewise,<br>
to ensure that the optimal colors are used at depths 2, 4, and 8, we do the same thing<br>
for each additional depth. We store the preferred colors at the appropriate position in<br>
the palette. Figure 6 shows how a typical palette could be configured to handle multiple<br>
bit depths. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;In our sample palette, the first 16 colors are defined as shades of gray, because we've<br>
decided our window would look best when displayed in grayscale on a 1-, 2-, or 4-bit<br>
device. For the 1-bit and 2- bit&nbsp;&nbsp;devices, we simply choose the appropriate shades for<br>
those depths and store them in the first four slots of our palette. But for an 8-bit<br>
device, we include as many colors as we can for the optimal display at that depth. For<br>
this example, we added the nongrayscale colors from the standard 8-bit color table to<br>
the remaining slots in our palette. Because the Palette Manager only uses the<br>
maximum number of colors it can (starting at the first index in the palette) for a<br>
specific bit depth, only the colors we want shown will be shown. Also, because the<br>
placement of the colors determines which colors are available at a certain depth, all<br>
the palette entries must be defined as explicit entries. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 6</b> A Palette Configured to Handle Multiple Bit Depths
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Another way of ensuring that certain palette entries are available at certain depths is<br>
to apply the inhibit usage categories to the palette entries. These inhibit constants tell<br>
the Palette Manager which entries are available under the current color environment.<br>
Depending on which inhibit constant is used, the palette entries can be inhibited from a<br>
specific bit depth and from a color or grayscale device. So by combining various<br>
inhibit constants to our sample palette, we can inhibit the colors outside the current<br>
depth's range from being used. In our example, if entry number 16 were defined with
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;pmInhibitC2 + pmInhibitC4 + pmInhibitG2 + pmInhibitG4
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;this entry would be available only on an 8-bit or deeper color or grayscale device. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;ONE LAST WORD</b><br>
The Palette Manager works very simply, but it has so many options and effects that it<br>
can seem complicated. By understanding how the Palette Manager makes its decisions,<br>
you should find it easy to figure out how to make it do precisely what you want. We<br>
hope this column has made this clear, so that you can use the Palette Manager and avoid<br>
fussing with the alternatives.
