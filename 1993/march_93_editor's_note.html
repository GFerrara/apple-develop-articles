<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>

<h1>CAROLINE ROSE</h1>
<p>
&nbsp;Dear Readers,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;In May of last year, I schmoozed with a lot of developers at Apple's Worldwide<br>
Developer's Conference, and one of the subjects that came up was documentation. I<br>
expressed my ideas on this subject somewhat hesitantly, because I thought the truths I<br>
was spouting were all pretty obvious, but I was surprised to find that several<br>
developers seemed enlightened by them and even suggested this as a topic for a <i> develop</i><br>
editorial. So here goes.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;But first, some motivation. If you're one of those developers who think no one reads<br>
manuals anyway, has it occurred to you that this might be a self-fulfilling prophecy?<br>
If manuals were better, maybe people would read them. Also, customers who <i> do</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;never<br>
read the manual will never learn the full power of your product (probably not <i> every </i><br>
feature is self-explanatory) and will be that much quicker to move on when someone<br>
shows them the great things a rival product can do. More likely, people glance at the<br>
manual to get started and then thumb through it later when they want to explore<br>
certain features.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Also keep in mind that a shoddy manual will be seen as a reflection of the product as a<br>
whole: "If this is the best they could do on the manual, how good can their software<br>
be?" Don't fool yourself that only writers or editors will criticize a poorly done<br>
manual; any reader who has trouble learning from it will complain, and not just to<br>
themselves. While there are times when consistency may be the hobgoblin of small<br>
minds, it's often the case that inconsistent presentation or terminology will confuse<br>
readers and have them throwing your manual down in disgust and thinking your<br>
product is more complicated than it really is. And people who do know things like the<br>
difference between "its" and "it's" will wonder how well you debugged your code if you<br>
couldn't find mistakes like this in your manual. Basically, you won't look like a class<br>
act.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I'll state the following points with user documentation in mind, though most of them<br>
also apply to technical documentation for developers. Some points may be useful only<br>
to small companies, but there should be something here for everyone.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a technical writer to write your documentation. Don't do it yourself<br>
-- and try to talk the CEO or VP of Marketing out of doing it. Contrary to many<br>
people's opinions, writing a manual is not something any smart person can do;<br>
it's a skill like any other. Most likely you are no more qualified to write the<br>
documentation than a writer is qualified to write your code.</li>
<li>Look over a relevant writing sample from your prospective writer.<br>
Awards, certificates, and years of experience go only so far: nothing will tell<br>
you whether you'll get a good manual as much as looking at past work. Ask how<br>
the material for the sample was gathered, who else contributed to it, and how<br>
heavily it was edited. </li>
<li>Get the writer started early in the process -- long before the feature set<br>
is frozen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writers provide a valuable perspective of your product, not unlike<br>
that of product management. They'll help with the design of the product, telling<br>
you what features don't fit in with other ones and pointing out loopholes,<br>
inconsistencies, and other Bad Things. And they're typically excellent bug<br>
finders. </li>
<li>Have the documentation edited by an editor. Unless they also happen to be<br>
editors, writers need their work checked like anyone else -- and an electronic<br>
spelling or grammar check (while a good start) isn't enough. </li>
<li>Test the result on users, after your product ships if not sooner (you can<br>
revise the documentation for the next printing). And don't be defensive: if only<br>
one out of ten "testers" turns up a particular problem, it may mean that 10%<br>
of your user base will have the same problem. Judge no misunderstanding as<br>
stupid; they're all valid, no matter how much you may disagree with them. </li>
</ul>
<p>
I could go on forever, but that's enough for now. Please make my day and let me know if<br>
you got anything of value out of this. Or criticize it if you like; I can use the practice in<br>
not being defensive. 
</p>

<b>CAROLINE ROSE </b>(AppleLink CROSE) has been writing and editing software<br>
documentation since many of you were rug rats. She began at a timesharing company,<br>
joined Apple in 1982 to write <i> Inside Macintosh</i> , and helped get NeXT off the ground in<br>
1986. Back at Apple now, she has seven issues of <i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;under her belt and is still<br>
having a wonderful time. A transplanted New Yorker, Caroline visited the East Coast<br>
last October in time to see the leaves turn colors. She enjoyed doing the theater and<br>
museum thing in Manhattan and hitting some incredible restaurants and nightclubs --<br>
not to mention a deli whose smoked mozarella is the best this side of Naples. But the<br>
highlight was her visit to a friend's farm in Connecticut (sheep feeding beats sheet<br>
feeding any day!). Walking to an apple orchard and tasting fresh sweet cider was sheer<br>
rural bliss.*
