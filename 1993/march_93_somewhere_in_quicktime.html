To inaugurate this new column on QuickTime, we'll take a look at ten useful tips for<br>
QuickTime application developers. This is certainly not an exhaustive list, but it<i>is</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;an<br>
important one.
</p>

Here's the list:

</ol>
<p>
Some of the tips describe pitfalls that need to be avoided, while others are simply<br>
clarifications. Let's take a closer look at each one. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>10. Working around data reference limitations. </i></b>
</p>
<p>
A current limitation of QuickTime is that each media can have only one data reference<br>
to a media data file. This isn't a problem except when you start cutting and pasting<br>
between tracks that refer to different media. You'll then be required to copy the media<br>
data from one media data file to another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, InsertTrackSegment will copy<br>
media data between media if the tracks refer to different media. 
</p>
<p>
Calls like GetMediaDataRefCount, AddMediaDataRef, and GetMediaDataRef will reflect<br>
the "one data reference" limitation by only accepting index values of 1. You can't<br>
replace an existing media data reference in QuickTime 1.0, but you can in QuickTime<br>
1.5, with a new call, SetMediaDataRef. Using this routine is a common way of<br>
manuallyresolving media data references that may have been moved by an application.<br>
For example, if you move a movie data file onto a different volume, you can update the<br>
alias using the Alias Manager and update the data reference for the movie with<br>
SetMediaDataRef. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>9. Using GetMovieNextInterestingTime. </i></b>
</p>
<p>
Since QuickTime is time based rather than frame-number based in the way it deals<br>
with temporal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;video data, a common question is how to get information about movie<br>
frames, such as frame rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is to use GetMovieNextInterestingTime.<br>
This function allows you to step quickly and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;easily through interesting times in a<br>
movie. For example, for an estimate of the frame rate of a movie,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you could use<br>
GetMovieNextInterestingTime to count the total number of frames in the movie and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
divide it by the total duration of the movie. Likewise, you could use<br>
GetMovieNextInterestingTime&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to identify the 600th frame in a movie. Since the<br>
internal data structure of QuickTime movies is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;optimized for accessing this type of<br>
information, GetMovieNextInterestingTime and the other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetNextInterestingTime<br>
calls are very efficient. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>8. Not calling ExitMovies. </i></b>
</p>
<p>
One recommendation that contradicts QuickTime 1.0 documentation is that applications<br>
should not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call ExitMovies before quitting. QuickTime calls this function at<br>
ExitToShell time, and it's safer to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allow QuickTime to release private storage and<br>
component connections at that time. This prevents&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problems such as closing<br>
components in the wrong order. For example, the proper way to clean up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after a<br>
movie that uses a standard movie controller is to dispose of the movie controller first,<br>
and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then dispose of the movie. If done in the reverse order, there may be adverse<br>
consequences. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>7. Getting a movie's unscaled size. </i></b>
</p>
<p>
An application should save the movie box obtained with GetMovieBox when a movie is<br>
loaded so&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it can retrieve the intended offset and scaling of the movie for<br>
playback. However, some&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applications may also want to get the unscaled size, and<br>
there isn't an intuitive way to get it. Since the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;programmatical effect of calling<br>
SetMovieBox is that the movie matrix is changed to reflect the new&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offset and<br>
scaling, you can easily get the movie box for an unscaled movie by setting the movie<br>
matrix&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the identity matrix; using the utility routine SetIdentityMatrix along with<br>
SetMovieMatrix&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accomplishes this. Then GetMovieBox will return the unscaled size<br>
and offsets. 
</p>
<p>
However, there's a loophole. If a track inside the movie is scaled, there may still be<br>
scaling in playback since QuickTime supports transformation matrices for movies and<br>
for tracks within a movie. Therefore, when working with scaling, applications need to<br>
pay attention not only to the movie's scaling but to the tracks' scaling as well. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>6. Avoiding the Movie Toolbox when using the standard movie controller.</i></b>
</p>

<p>
When using the standard movie controller, you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should almost never use any Movie<br>
Toolbox routines that control movie playback or change movie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;characteristics. For<br>
example, it would be a mistake to call StartMovie to start playing a movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead,<br>
use the movie controller equivalent, MCDoAction with mcActionPlay. Calling<br>
StartMovie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directly causes the movie to play but with the controller's button in the<br>
pause state, not reflecting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the movie is playing back. Similarly, to set looping,<br>
you would use MCDoAction with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mcActionSetLooping. Bypassing the movie controller<br>
by using the Movie Toolbox routines directly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on a movie controlled with a movie<br>
controller can have dire consequences. As an example, if you set&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looping for a movie<br>
before creating a controller with NewMovieController, you'll cause the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macintosh to<br>
crash. Don't let it happen to you!
</p>
<p>
<b><i>5. Prerolling a movie for improved playback. </i></b>
</p>
<p>
Prerolling can improve playback performance by allowing QuickTime to do<br>
preliminary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initialization. Since PrerollMovie is passed the movie time and rate, it<br>
can fill buffers and caches&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;optimally to prevent initial stuttering. Normally,<br>
QuickTime automatically prerolls the movie for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you. For example, if you call<br>
StartMovie, you don't need to also call PrerollMovie, since StartMovie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prerolls the<br>
movie for you. The QuickTime 1.5 documentation describing the StartMovie call states<br>
this clearly. Likewise, the standard movie controller is optimized to preroll whenever<br>
the user starts a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;movie with the keyboard or mouse. If you call PrerollMovie in<br>
these situations, the second&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PrerollMovie is redundant and will simply waste time.<br>
In all other cases, prerolling by calling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PrerollMovie is recommended before<br>
initiating playback. For example, you should call PrerollMovie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before<br>
SetMovieRate. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>4. Using CustomGetFilePreview with custom dialogs. </i></b>
</p>
<p>
If you use CustomGetFilePreview with custom DLOG and DITL resources, you should be<br>
aware of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a bug with the System 7 pop-up menu CDEF: pop-up menus used in<br>
conjunction with black-and-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;white grafPorts are shifted to the wrong location<br>
within the dialog box. The simple workaround is to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;force the dialog to be a cGrafPort<br>
by adding a 'dctb' resource with the same ID as the DLOG and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DITL resources. You can<br>
easily create a 'dctb' resource with ResEdit by selecting the Custom color&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;button in<br>
the DLOG resource template window. For more information on the 'dctb' resource, see <br>
the Dialog Manager chapter in<i>Inside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox Essentials</i> (or in<br>
<i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume V). 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>3. Conditionally registering a component that requires a hardware</i></b><br>
<b><i>device. </i></b>
</p>
<p>
If you write a component that requires a hardware device, you should set the<br>
wantsRegisterMessage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flag to give your component an opportunity to verify that the<br>
specific hardware is properly installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hardware isn't available, you can<br>
then indicate to the Component Manager that you don't want&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the component<br>
registered. The register routine, called with selector kComponentRegister, should&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
return FALSE if it does want to be registered and TRUE if it doesn't. 
</p>
<p>
One thing to be aware of is that even during registration, the component will be opened<br>
with OpenComponent and closed with CloseComponent. Therefore, you can expect<br>
OpenComponent before the ComponentRegister routine is called, and CloseComponent<br>
after ComponentRegister is called. 
</p>
<p>
For example, if you have a 'vdig' that works with a NuBus video digitizer card, each<br>
time that OpenComponent is called you can check whether the hardware is correctly<br>
installed, and then return that status when ComponentRegister is called by the<br>
Component Manager. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>2. Detaching a movie controller properly. </i></b>
</p>
<p>
If you want to place the standard movie controller in a different window or location<br>
from its usual&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;placement directly below the movie, you must detach the movie<br>
controller. Follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>First bring up the controller by calling NewMovieController with the flag<br>
mcNotVisible so that the controller is initially invisible. If you don't do this,<br>
the application will momentarily display the controller in the wrong location.</li>
<li>Call MCSetControllerAttached with FALSE to detach the controller. </li>
<li>Call MCSetControllerPort to move the controller to a different port if you<br>
want to place it in a different window. If you only want to move the controller<br>
in the same window as the movie, you don't have to call MCSetControllerPort. </li>
<li>Call either MCPositionController or MCSetControllerBoundsRect to move<br>
the controller to the new location in the port. </li>
<li>Call MCSetVisible to display the controller. </li>
</ol>
<p>
The movie will remain in whatever port it was assigned to using SetMovieGWorld. If<br>
MCSetControllerPort isn't called (step 3), the controller will remain assigned to the<br>
movie's port when NewMovieController is called. 
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<p>
<code>SetMovieGWorld(myMovie, (CGrafPtr) myWindow, 0);</code><br>
<code>mcMC = NewMovieController(myMovie, &amp;movieBounds,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mcTopLeftMovie + mcNotVisible);</code><br>
<code>MCSetControllerAttached(mcMC, FALSE);</code><br>
<code>MCSetControllerPort(mcMC, myOtherWindow);</code><br>
<code>MCPositionController(myMC, &amp;movieBounds,</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;newControllerRect, mcTopLeftMovie);</code><br>
<code>MCSetVisible(myMC, TRUE);</code>
</p>
<p>
<b><i>1. Calling MaxApplZone from every application. </i></b>
</p>
<p>
Not calling MaxApplZone in an application is the reason why many simple QuickTime<br>
playback&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applications play back movies poorly. Because the Memory Manager grows<br>
the heap only if there&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any purgeable or free space left, QuickTime doesn't<br>
have the space it needs to play back a movie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;optimally. Since there's no penalty or<br>
drawback for calling MaxApplZone, all applications should call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the routine during<br>
initialization. In fact, MaxApplZone should be your first Macintosh Toolbox call,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
because initializing QuickDraw and other managers could allocate memory. 
</p>
<p>
We hope these tips will help you avoid some of the most common pitfalls of QuickTime<br>
development. With so many developers writing QuickTime applications and adding<br>
QuickTime support into existing applications, we want the journey to be as smooth as<br>
possible. We'll keep you updated and informed by continuing to bring you insightful<br>
