<h2>THE ZEN OF WINDOW ZOOMING</h2>

<p>
<i>Window zooming is a feature of the Macintosh user interface that's rarely implemented</i><br>
<i>correctly. Because a lot of calculation and pixel-tweaking is required toachieve the</i><br>
<i>"perfect" window zoom, few applications go through the effort to properlyzoom their</i><br>
<i>document windows. This article discusses proper zooming etiquette andprovides a</i><br>
<i>routine that deals with all the details of zooming windows.</i>
</p>
<p>
About once a year, I go on a tirade about how few programs zoom their windows<br>
properly. Most programs zoom to the full size of the main screen; other applications<br>
make the window only as big as they need to but still move it to the main screen, even<br>
if the window is on another screen. The System 7 Finder comes close to making me<br>
happy, but every once in a while it zips a window to the main screen for reasons<br>
known only to the Finder engineers. 
</p>
<p>
As I was writing some application code recently, I took the opportunity to make it zoom<br>
windows the way I wish all other programs would zoom windows. The resulting code<br>
(which is on this issue's CD) is the basis for this article. The zooming behavior that<br>
this code implements reflects all the documentation Apple has ever published about<br>
window zooming, from the old Human Interface notes to the Window Manager chapter<br>
in<i>Inside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox Essentials</i> . 
</p>
<h2>THE ETIQUETTE OF ZOOMING</h2>
<p>
First let's look at the subtle effects of a user's actions on how a window should be<br>
zoomed. After some basic definitions, we'll go over a few rules that govern zooming<br>
behavior. If you couldn't care less about these preliminaries, you can skip to the<br>
section "The Zooming Code" (however, if you do this, you'll hurt the author's feelings,<br>
since he spent a perfect Saturday afternoon indoors to write this article). 
</p>
<p>
<b>THE STATES OF A WINDOW</b><br>
A window is zoomed between two states, the<i>user state</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;and the<i> standard state</i> . The user<br>
state is any size and position in which the user can place the window on the desktop.<br>
The Window Manager updates the user state when it calls a WDEF to recalculate a<br>
window's regions.
</p>
<p>
The standard state of a window is defined to be the size that can best display the data<br>
contained in the window. For example, in word processing applications the standard<br>
state of a document window would most likely be the size of a printed page. For some<br>
types of windows the standard state depends on the window's contents and so is<br>
determined dynamically by the application when the user zooms the window. In the<br>
Finder, for instance, the standard state of a window in an icon view would be the<br>
smallest size that can display all the icons in that window. The position of a window in<br>
its standard state varies depending on the position of the user state when the window<br>
was zoomed and on other factors, as explained later. 
</p>
<p>
Figure 1 shows the user state and standard state of a Finder window displayed in the<br>
"small icon" view. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 1</b> The User and Standard States of a Window
</p>
<p>
<b>RULES OF THE ROAD</b><br>
In addition, there are a few rules that govern how a window should be zoomed in<br>
different situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rules can be divided into two categories: rules on size and<br>
rules on position. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Rules on size. </b>Although the standard state of a window is defined to be the best size<br>
for displaying the window's contents, this state is actually constrained by the size of<br>
the screen to which the window is being zoomed. If the ideal size for the standard state<br>
is larger than the destination screen, the window should be pinned to the size of the<br>
screen, minus some slop pixels. For example, Figure 2 shows the height of the<br>
standard state being pinned on the main screen. (Note that space was also left for the<br>
menu bar.)
</p>
<p>
If a window is being zoomed to the main screen and the ideal size for the standard state<br>
would take up the entire width of the screen, a strip of space should be left on the right<br>
side of the screen to let the first column of Finder icons show through.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 2</b> Pinning to the Screen Size
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Rules on position. </b>The basic guideline for positioning a window during a zoom is<br>
that the window should move as little as possible, to avoid distracting the user. 
</p>
<p>
A window in its standard state should be positioned so that it's entirely on one screen.<br>
If a window straddles more than one screen in the user state and is subsequently<br>
zoomed to the standard state, it should be zoomed to the screen that contains the largest<br>
portion of the window's content region.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(See Figure 3.)When a window is zoomed<br>
from the user state to the standard state, it should be anchored at its current top left<br>
corner if possible. If the standard state size will fit on the screen without moving the<br>
window, the window can simply be resized. If the standard state of the window cannot<br>
fit with the top left corner anchored, the window should be "nudged" so that the parts<br>
that were off the screen fall just on screen. (See Figure 4.)
</p>
<h2>THE ZOOMING CODE</h2>
<p>
This section goes through the window zooming code chunk by chunk, discussing the<br>
logic behind each step. 
</p>
<p>
ZoomTheWindow is the entry point to the window zooming code. It determines the best<br>
screen to zoom the window to, and nudges the window into position in case part of it<br>
falls off the edge of the screen. Applications should call this routine instead of calling<br>
the Toolbox routine ZoomWindow directly.

<b>&nbsp;Figure 4</b> Nudge Zooming
</p>
<p>
ZoomTheWindow has the following prototype:
</p>
<pre>void ZoomTheWindow(WindowPeek theWindow, short zoomState,
            CalcIdealDocumentSizeProcPtr calcRoutine);</pre>
<p>
The first two parameters, theWindow and zoomState, are identical to the first two<br>
parameters of ZoomWindow. The last parameter, calcRoutine, is an<br>
application-supplied callback routine that calculates the ideal size for the window<br>
without taking the user's screen configuration into consideration. The prototype of the<br>
CalcIdealDocumentSizeProcPtr function type is as follows:
</p>
<pre>typedef void (*CalcIdealDocumentSizeProcPtr)
            (WindowPtr theWindow, Rect *idealContentSize);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Given the window to be zoomed, the callback routine returns (in local coordinates) the<br>
ideal rectangle for the window in the idealContentSize parameter. The window will be<br>
the current graphics port when the callback routine is invoked. 
</p>
<p>
ZoomTheWindow calls two utility routines, CalculateWindowAreaOnScreen and<br>
CalculateOffsetAmount. CalculateWindowAreaOnScreen calculates the area of a window<br>
on a screen. The screen that contains the largest portion of the window is the screen<br>
that the window will be zoomed to. If ZoomTheWindow determines that anchoring the<br>
window at its current top left corner will result in part of the window lying off the<br>
screen, it calls CalculateOffsetAmount to find out how many pixels the window needs to<br>
be nudged so that it's entirely on the screen. These utility routines are described in<br>
detail following the discussion of ZoomTheWindow below. 
</p>
<p>
<b>THE ZOOMDATA STRUCTURE</b><br>
The ZoomData structure is used by ZoomTheWindow to hold information about the<br>
screen the window should be zoomed to. ZoomTheWindow uses DeviceLoop to find the<br>
screen containing the largest portion of the window. The DeviceLoop drawing procedure<br>
updates the ZoomData structure as DeviceLoop calls it for each active screen device. 
</p>
<pre>struct ZoomData {
    GDHandle    screenWithLargestPartOfWindow;
    unsigned    long largestArea;
    Rect        windowBounds;
};
typedef struct ZoomData ZoomData, *ZoomDataPtr;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The screenWithLargestPartOfWindow field is a handle to the screen device that the<br>
window should be zoomed to. The largestArea field holds the area of the largest portion<br>
of the window encounteredso far, as DeviceLoop iterates through the screens. The<br>
windowBounds field is the portion of the window that's currently visible on the<br>
desktop. 
</p>
<p>
<b>THE ZOOMTHEWINDOW ROUTINE</b><br>
About 90% of the code in ZoomTheWindow executes only when the window is to be<br>
zoomed to the standard state. The routine starts by setting up the current graphics port<br>
and getting some frequently used fields out of the window record. 
</p>
<pre>void ZoomTheWindow(WindowPeek theWindow, short zoomState,
                    CalcIdealDocumentSizeProcPtr calcRoutine)
{
    ZoomData    zoomData;
    Rect        newStandardRect, scratchRect, screenRect, portRect;
    Rect        contentRegionBoundingBox, structureRegionBoundingBox;
    Rect        deviceLoopRect;
    GrafPtr     currentPort;
    RgnHandle   scratchRegion, contentRegion, structureRegion;
    GDHandle    mainDevice;
    short       horizontalAmountOffScreen, verticalAmountOffScreen;
    short       windowFrameTopSize, windowFrameLeftSize;
    short       windowFrameRightSize, windowFrameBottomSize;

    GetPort(&amp;currentPort);
    SetPort((WindowPtr) theWindow);
    contentRegion = GetWindowContentRegion(theWindow);
    structureRegion = GetWindowStructureRegion(theWindow);
    GetWindowPortRect(theWindow, &amp;portRect);
    contentRegionBoundingBox = (**contentRegion).rgnBBox;
    structureRegionBoundingBox = (**structureRegion).rgnBBox;
    windowFrameTopSize = contentRegionBoundingBox.top -
                            structureRegionBoundingBox.top;
    windowFrameLeftSize = contentRegionBoundingBox.left -
                            structureRegionBoundingBox.left;
    windowFrameRightSize = structureRegionBoundingBox.right -
                            contentRegionBoundingBox.right;
    windowFrameBottomSize = structureRegionBoundingBox.bottom -
                            contentRegionBoundingBox.bottom;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Determining the proper screen. </b>The code then determines which screen contains<br>
the largest portion of the window, as follows:
</p>
<pre>// If the window is being zoomed to the standard state, calculate the
// best size to display the window's information.
mainDevice = GetMainDevice();
if (zoomState == inZoomOut) {
    zoomData.screenWithLargestPartOfWindow = mainDevice;
    zoomData.largestArea = 0;
   
    // Get the portion of the window that's on the desktop.
    scratchRegion = NewRgn();
    SectRgn(GetGrayRgn(), contentRegion, scratchRegion);
    if (EmptyRgn(scratchRegion))
        zoomData.windowBounds = structureRegionBoundingBox;
    else
        zoomData.windowBounds = contentRegionBoundingBox;
   
    // Use DeviceLoop to walk through all the active screens to find
    // the one with the largest portion of the zoomed window.
    deviceLoopRect = zoomData.windowBounds;
    GlobalToLocal((Point *)&amp;deviceLoopRect);
    GlobalToLocal((Point *)&amp;deviceLoopRect.bottom);
    RectRgn(scratchRegion, &amp;deviceLoopRect);
    DeviceLoop(scratchRegion, &amp;CalcWindowAreaOnScreen,
         (long) &amp;zoomData, (DeviceLoopFlags) singleDevices);
    DisposeRgn(scratchRegion);
    screenRect = (**(zoomData.screenWithLargestPartOfWindow)).gdRect;
   
    // If the window will be zoomed to the main screen, change the
    // top of the usable screen area so that the window's title bar
    // won't be placed under the menu bar.
    if (zoomData.screenWithLargestPartOfWindow == mainDevice)
        screenRect.top += GetMBarHeight();</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
ZoomTheWindow sets up default values in the ZoomData structure so that the window<br>
will zoom to the main screen by default. Normally, the content area of the window is<br>
used to determine the area of the window that's on each screen. However, if the user<br>
has the window positioned such that only the title bar (or a portion of the title bar) is<br>
visible on the desktop, the structure region of the window is used to determine the<br>
screen that contains the largest portion of the title bar. 
</p>
<p>
One of the little-known facts about the universe is that inspiration actually comes<br>
from subatomic particles flying around in deep space. These particles occasionally hit<br>
a sentient brain, resulting in a flash of inspiration. One of these events resulted in the<br>
use of DeviceLoop to iterate through the list of active screen devices. (Of course, this<br>
means that the zooming code requires System 7; for a System 6 alternative to<br>
DeviceLoop, see "Graphical Truffles: Multiple Screens Revealed" in<i>develop</i> Issue 10.)<br>
The CalcWindowAreaOnScreen routine is the DeviceLoop drawing procedure. The<br>
ZoomData structure is passed to DeviceLoop as the userData value, and the DeviceLoop<br>
flags are set so that DeviceLoop will call its drawing procedure for each screen device.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Determining the ideal size for the window. </b>After determining the proper<br>
screen to zoom to, the application's callback routine is called to get back the ideal<br>
content size for the window. This rectangle is then anchored at the window's current<br>
top left corner and expanded to include the window frame. 
</p>
<pre>    // Figure out the perfect size for the window as if we had an
    // infinitely large screen.
    (*calcRoutine)((WindowPtr) theWindow, &amp;newStandardRect);
   
    // Anchor the new rectangle at the current top left corner of the
    // window.
    OffsetRect(&amp;newStandardRect, -newStandardRect.left,
                -newStandardRect.top);
    OffsetRect(&amp;newStandardRect, contentRegionBoundingBox.left,
                contentRegionBoundingBox.top);
   
    // Add the window frame to the ideal content rect.
    newStandardRect.top -= windowFrameTopSize;
    newStandardRect.left -= windowFrameLeftSize;
    newStandardRect.right += windowFrameRightSize;
    newStandardRect.bottom += windowFrameBottomSize;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Fitting the ideal size onto the screen. </b>This is the tedious part of the code. At<br>
this point, newStandardRect holds the ideal size for the window being zoomed. Since a<br>
window in its standard state must be entirely on one screen, we ensure that the window<br>
fits on the screen, maintaining its ideal size if possible. 
</p>
<pre>    // If the new rectangle falls off the edge of the screen, nudge it
    // so that it's just on the screen. CalculateOffsetAmount
    // determines how much of the window is off the screen.
    SectRect(&amp;newStandardRect, &amp;screenRect, &amp;scratchRect);
    if (!EqualRect(&amp;newStandardRect, &amp;scratchRect)) {
        horizontalAmountOffScreen = CalculateOffsetAmount(
                            newStandardRect.left,
                            newStandardRect.right,
                            scratchRect.left, scratchRect.right,
                            screenRect.left, screenRect.right);
        verticalAmountOffScreen = CalculateOffsetAmount(
                            newStandardRect.top,
                            newStandardRect.bottom,
                            scratchRect.top, scratchRect.bottom,

    }
       
    // If we're still falling off the edge of the screen, the perfect
    // size is larger than the screen, so shrink the standard size.
    SectRect(&amp;newStandardRect, &amp;screenRect, &amp;scratchRect);
    if (!EqualRect(&amp;newStandardRect, &amp;scratchRect)) {
    // First shrink the width. If the window is wider than the screen
    // it's being zoomed to, just pin the standard rectangle to the
    // edges of the screen, leaving some slop; otherwise, we know we
    // just nudged the window into position, so do nothing.
        if ((newStandardRect.right - newStandardRect.left) &gt;
                (screenRect.right - screenRect.left)) {
            newStandardRect.left = screenRect.left + kNudgeSlop;
            newStandardRect.right = screenRect.right - kNudgeSlop;
       
            if ((zoomData.screenWithLargestPartOfWindow ==
                    mainDevice) &amp;&amp;
                (newStandardRect.right &gt;
                   (screenRect.right - kIconSpace)))
                newStandardRect.right =
                    screenRect.right - kIconSpace;
        }
   
    // Move in the top of the window. As with the width of the
    // window, do nothing unless the window is taller than the
    // height of the screen.
    if ((newStandardRect.bottom - newStandardRect.top) &gt;
            (screenRect.bottom - screenRect.top)) {
        newStandardRect.top = screenRect.top + kNudgeSlop;
        newStandardRect.bottom = screenRect.bottom - kNudgeSlop;
        }
    }

    // We've got the best possible window position. Remove the
    // frame, slam it into the WStateData record and let ZoomWindow
    // take care of the rest.
    newStandardRect.top += windowFrameTopSize;
    newStandardRect.left += windowFrameLeftSize;
    newStandardRect.right -= windowFrameRightSize;
    newStandardRect.bottom -= windowFrameBottomSize;
    SetWindowStandardState(theWindow, &amp;newStandardRect);
} // if (zoomState == inZoomOut)
else
    GetWindowUserState(theWindow, &amp;newStandardRect);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We call CalculateOffsetAmount to determine how much to nudge the window if it falls<br>
off the edge of the screen in its ideal size. After nudging the window, we double check to<br>
see if the window is entirely on the screen. If it still isn't, that means that the ideal<br>
size of the window is larger than the screen that it's zooming to, so the window has to<br>
be shrunk to fit on the screen. The code shrinks the window so that there's a small area<br>
of slop space between the edge of the window and the screen boundary. Additionally, if<br>
the screen that the window is zooming to is the main screen, space is left for the menu<br>
bar and a column of Finder icons.&nbsp;&nbsp;After all that, newStandardRect contains the best<br>
size for the window for that screen. After we remove the window frame, the stdState<br>
field of the WStateData record can be filled with this rectangle. 
</p>
<p>
There's also the simple case of zooming to the user state. Since the Window Manager<br>
takes care of keeping the userState field of the WStateData record up to date, that<br>
rectangle is easy to get. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Zooming the window. </b>Finally, all that's left to do is to actually zoom the window.<br>
One final optimization that can be performed is that if the top left corner of the window<br>
hasn't moved, SizeWindow can be called instead of ZoomWindow, reducing the amount<br>
of redrawing that needs to be done. The window's clipping region is reset to be the size<br>
of the window to ensure that the window's contents are entirely erased before<br>
ZoomWindow is called. 
</p>
<pre>    // If the window is still anchored at the current top left corner,
    // just resize it.
    if ((newStandardRect.left == contentRegionBoundingBox.left) &amp;&amp;
            (newStandardRect.top == contentRegionBoundingBox.top)) {
        OffsetRect(&amp;newStandardRect, -newStandardRect.left,
                    -newStandardRect.top);
        SizeWindow((WindowPtr) theWindow, newStandardRect.right,
                    newStandardRect.bottom, true);
    }
    else {
        scratchRegion = NewRgn();
        GetClip(scratchRegion);
        ClipRect(&amp;portRect);
        EraseRect(&amp;portRect);
        ZoomWindow((WindowPtr) theWindow, zoomState, false);
        SetClip(scratchRegion);
        DisposeRgn(scratchRegion);
    }
    SetPort(currentPort);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>THE CALCWINDOWAREAONSCREEN ROUTINE</b><br>
CalcWindowAreaOnScreen, the DeviceLoop drawing procedure for the zooming code,<br>
doesn't actually do any drawing, but instead simply calculates the area of the window<br>
that's on a screen. If there's more content area on one screen than any of the other<br>
screens that have been encountered so far, CalcWindowAreaOnScreen saves the<br>
GDHandle of this screen in the ZoomData structure as the potential screen to zoom the<br>
window to. 
</p>
<pre>pascal void CalcWindowAreaOnScreen(short depth, short deviceFlags,
GDHandle targetDevice, long userData)
{
#pragma unused (depth, deviceFlags)
    ZoomDataPtr     zoomData = (ZoomDataPtr) userData;
    unsigned long   windowAreaOnScreen;
    Rect            windowPortionOnScreen;
   
    // Find the rectangle that encloses the intersection of the
    // screen and the document window.
    SectRect(&amp;(zoomData-&gt;windowBounds), &amp;((**targetDevice).gdRect),
    &amp;windowPortionOnScreen);
   
    // Offset this rectangle so that its right and bottom are also
    // its width and height.
    OffsetRect(&amp;windowPortionOnScreen, -windowPortionOnScreen.left,
                -windowPortionOnScreen.top);

    // Calculate the area of the part of the window that is on this
    // screen.
    windowAreaOnScreen = windowPortionOnScreen.right *
    windowPortionOnScreen.bottom;
   
    // If this is the largest area that has been encountered so far,
    // remember this screen as the potential screen to zoom to.
    if (windowAreaOnScreen &gt; zoomData-&gt;largestArea) {
        zoomData-&gt;largestArea = windowAreaOnScreen;
        zoomData-&gt;screenWithLargestPartOfWindow = targetDevice;
    }
}</pre>
<p>
<b>THE CALCULATEOFFSETAMOUNT ROUTINE</b><br>
The zooming code calls the CalculateOffsetAmount routine to calculate the number of<br>
pixels the window needs to be nudged to be entirely on the screen. This routine works<br>
in one dimension at a time, so ZoomTheWindow calls it twice, once for the width of a<br>
window and once for the window's height. If CalculateOffsetAmount determines that the<br>
window is larger than the screen, it returns 0 for the offset, since the window will be<br>
resized later. 
</p>
<pre>short CalculateOffsetAmount(short idealStartPoint,
        short idealEndPoint, short idealOnScreenStartPoint,
        short idealOnScreenEndPoint, short screenEdge1,
        short screenEdge2)
{
    short offsetAmount;
   
    // Check to see if the window fits on the screen in this
    // dimension.
    if ((idealStartPoint &lt; screenEdge1) &amp;&amp;
            (idealEndPoint &gt; screenEdge2))
        offsetAmount = 0;
    else {
        // Find out how much of the window lies off this screen by
        // subtracting the amount of the window that's on the screen
        // from the size of the entire window in this dimension. If
        // the window is completely off-screen, offset the window so
        // that it's placed just on the screen.
        if ((idealOnScreenStartPoint - idealOnScreenEndPoint) == 0) {
            // See if the window is lying to the left or above the
            // screen.
            if (idealEndPoint &lt; screenEdge1)
                offsetAmount =
                    screenEdge1 - idealStartPoint + kNudgeSlop;
            else
                // Otherwise, it's below or to the right of the
                // screen.
                offsetAmount =
                    screenEdge2 - idealEndPoint - kNudgeSlop;

<p>
CalculateOffsetAmount determines the nudge amount by calculating the amount of<br>
overlap of two line segments. The first line segment, described by the idealStartPoint<br>
and idealEndPoint parameters, is the width or height of the window being zoomed. The<br>
second line segment, described by the idealOnScreenStartPoint and<br>
idealOnScreenEndPoint parameters, is the part of the window's width or height that is<br>
on the screen the window will be zoomed to. The number of pixels the window will be<br>
nudged is the difference between the lengths of these two line segments, plus some slop.<br>
If the length of the second line segment is 0, the window is entirely off the screen that<br>
it will be zoomed to. In this case, CalculateOffsetAmount will return the number of<br>
pixels the window will have to be nudged to be just on the screen. A third line segment,<br>
describing the screen width or height, is used to check whether the window is larger<br>
than the screen and to determine the direction to nudge the window.

<h2>ZOOMING AWAY</h2>
<p>
The code presented in this article takes care of most of the work of zooming windows.<br>
All your application needs to do is supply the code that determines the ideal size for<br>
your windows. Hopefully, many more applications will implement proper zooming<br>
behavior in the near future. This will make the people in the offices around me<br>
especially happy, since it's one less thing I'll have to complain about.

<b>A lot of people think </b> the Window Manager has some magic value stashed away in a<br>
dark corner that tells it whether a window is in its user state or its standard state. In<br>
reality, it's not that sophisticated. It's actually the WDEF that does all the work, since<br>
it's the thing that really needs to know which state a window is in. To make this<br>
decision, the standard document WDEF takes a window's portRect, converts it to global<br>
coordinates, and then compares it with the user and standard state rectangles to<br>
determine which state the window is in. *

<b>If the structure region </b> is always used to calculate the screen containing most of<br>
the window, there's actually a scenario in which the code will zoom to the wrong<br>
screen. If the user has a multiscreen setup and places a window so that it sits across<br>
two screens, with only the title bar showing on one screen but a sliver of the content<br>
region showing on the other, and there's more title bar than content showing, the<br>
window will zoom to the first screen. However, since there is content area on the<br>
second screen, the window should zoom to that screen. *

<b>DEAN YU </b>recently went on a cross-country road trip in his new car. In retrospect,<br>
he decided that the time off wasn't worth the emotional trauma of being pelted by<br>
marble-sized hail in Cheyenne, Wyoming, being salt-blasted in the Utah salt flats,<br>
being nearly blown off the road as an 18-wheeler passed him at 95 miles an hour in<br>
the dead of night, and having his windshield chipped by gravel falling off a dump truck.<br>
Dean didn't even get the satisfaction of finding out exactly how fast he can drive without<br>
getting pulled over for speeding in Nebraska. Sympathy notes and donations for getting<br>
his car repaired can be sent to Dean in care of <i> develop</i> .*
