Before we get rolling here, I have a confession to make to those of you who have read<br>
this column in the last two issues. I feel I owe it to you for being so faithful. Due to lead<br>
times, publishing deadlines, and attempts to appear organized, <i>develop </i>authors<br>
actually write their MacNuggets of <i>wisdom </i>months&nbsp;&nbsp;before you read them. You've<br>
already had a chance to be in a New Year's Day fight with your significant other, yet<br>
I'm writing this before Hallowe'en. 
</p>
<p>
How do I put this? I've been lying to you. The questions in my earlier columns were<br>
fakes. I made them up for my own self-aggrandizement. Which is bad enough, but I also<br>
gave myself the heartwarmingly collectible gift that's supposed to be given to the<br>
dedicated readers who write in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Richard Nixon in the seventies, I guess the only<br>
defense I have is: I misspoke myself. 
</p>
<p>
But that's the past, and now my head reels because I've received <i>four </i>letters. (Well,<br>
actually I received three and develop's editor got a piece of hate mail.) Now I know<br>
what it's like to be 1/150,000th of "Dear Abby."
</p>
<p>
<i>Dear Tao,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Help! We have a power-hungry team member who is making the rest of the team</i><br>
<i>thoroughly miserable! What can we do? Mutiny has crossed our collective minds, but</i><br>
<i>after reading Mutiny on the Bounty none of us fancies suffering the fate of Mr.</i><br>
<i>Christian. </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Desperate</i>
</p>
<p>
Dear Desperate,
</p>
<p>
In general you'll find that the world is in turmoil for no reason other than intolerance.<br>
If people simply were more tolerant of each other's beliefs, values, customs, and<br>
driving skills, the world would be a much more hospitable place. Typically you should<br>
try to live in as much harmony as possible with your office workers in an effort to<br>
spread peace and happiness in the world. This, however, is not one of those times. 
</p>
<p>
You may be surprised to learn that the answer to your problem was at your fingertips;<br>
you just failed to dig far enough for it. All you needed to do was ask yourself a simple<br>
question: Whatwas the fate of Fletcher Christian? 
</p>
<p>
Historians have actually tried to cover up thereal reason there was mutiny: it had<br>
nothing to do with ill-tempered leadership. Rather, Mr. Christian couldn't stand being<br>
in an island-sized sauna with the obese Captain Bligh any longer. To remedy the<br>
situation, Mr. Christian decided to send Bligh on a crash diet the old-fashioned way: by<br>
making him row across 3500 miles of open ocean. 
</p>
<p>
Shortly after Bligh left, Mr. Christian got out his Apple I computer with cassette tape<br>
backup (remember, this was along time ago) and discovered that, by Jove, Bligh might<br>
actually make it. The last thing Mr. Christian wanted was to witness a size-6 Bligh<br>
parade his new physique around the island. So, he gathered up a bunch of Tahitian<br>
babes, sailed over to Pitcairn Island, burned the Bounty, and lived the rest of his life<br>
sipping coconut juice in a tropical paradise. The only penalty was that he would never<br>
be able to go back to a country where they serve a dish called "Spotted Dick" for<br>
dessert. To say it was a fair trade is a gross understatement. 
</p>
<p>
Taking a cue from Mr. Christian, I'd say the following actions are in order: First, get a<br>
detailed plan of your building(s) and find the spot that's the furthest from where the<br>
mutiny will actually take place; this will be your equivalent of Pitcairn Island. Due to<br>
twentieth-century building layout, it's very possible that you may have to choose<br>
someplace like a boiler room. This gives you the tropical climate by default, but I'd add<br>
some sand and a few posters just to spice the place up a bit. Don't forget to stock enough<br>
coconut milk to last until your management turns its attention to some other crisis.<br>
Two weeks worth is probably more than enough. 
</p>
<p>
Then, mutiny to your heart's content. Start by issuing a new org chart, and when your<br>
troublemaker comes to protest, just do whatever seems to be most natural. Be as loud<br>
and obnoxious as possible, and don't forget to throw in lines like "You call yourself a<br>
ship's Captain?" and "From now on you get your own breadfruit trees!" Burning things<br>
to the ground is optional. I wouldn't recommend it if your paycheck is important to<br>
you. 
</p>
<p>
There's a good chance you'll be set for life. Just be sure you don't get so carried away<br>
that you start sending postcards to your colleagues from your island retreat. Nothing<br>
gives away a hiding spot like a postmark. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Dear Tao,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Every time I get up quickly I become dizzy. Everyone thinks I have a drinking problem.</i><br>
<i>What can I do? </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Spinning in Sacramento</i>
</p>
<p>
Dear Spinning,
</p>
<p>
You're in a situation that has very serious physical and sociological implications and<br>
needs immediate attention. First and foremost, you should get yourself to a doctor. You<br>
may have something as complicated and life threatening as transient ischemic attack,<br>
or you may just be a ditz. Only a licensed physician will be able to tell for sure. By no<br>
means should you rely on self-diagnosis from watching reruns of "Marcus Welby,<br>
M.D." Remember, the guy who played Dr. Kiley tried that and he ended up inThe<br>
Amityville Horror. 
</p>
<p>
Whatever you do, if you go to a university to get checked, becertainthe person you're<br>
talking to is a Medical Doctor. You can't swing a dead cat in that environment without<br>
hitting someone who is all too willing to be called "Doctor" yet thinks that "throat<br>
culture" has something to do with opera.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people have the title "Doctor of<br>
Philosophy," and their specialty is to heal problems with philosophical ideals. If you<br>
believe your dizziness is caused by an inability to understand dialectic materialism,<br>
this type of doctor is perfect; otherwise, steer clear. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, getting fixed physically won't heal the seeping sociological wound that<br>
has opened by everyone thinking you're intoxicated. To tackle this part, first you<br>
should decide whether you deserve any time off from work. If you think you do, tell<br>
your boss you believe you have a substance abuse problem, and ask to have at least a<br>
month off to get yourself treated. If you happen to acquire a tan while you're gone, say<br>
that you had to have minor UV therapy for jaundice.
</p>
<p>
If you don't want the time off, or you want to squelch those rumors once and for all,<br>
simply stand up in your next company meeting and say something like, "I know many<br>
of you think I have a drinking problem due to my dizzy spells. This simply is not true.<br>
I just have a very strange habit of having my head reel whenever I get around a<br>
corporate back-stabbing weasel."

<h2>RECOMMENDED READING AND LISTENING</h2>

TAO JONES was stunned when he discovered that the actual lyrics to The Beatles' "Let It<br>
Be," were, "and in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me." He<br>
thought the line was, "and in my&nbsp;&nbsp;oblidoplous. . ." and spent the next ten years trying to<br>
figure out what an oblidoplous was. *

Tao needs questions to keep from hoarding the freebies he is supposed to be sending out<br>
to you, the devoted reader. Send your queries regarding all aspects of office survival,<br>
or just that funny little thing we call "life," to AppleLink DEVELOP, and there's a<br>
possibility that you'll end up even cooler than you are now. *
