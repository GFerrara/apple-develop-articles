</p>
<p>
<i>Apple and Novell recently announced a PowerPC version of NetWare. Under NetWare,</i><br>
<i>network services such as file servers, print spoolers, and electronic mail dispatchers</i><br>
<i>are written as NetWare loadable modules, or NLMs. By providing a software layer</i><br>
<i>between the NLMs and the hardware they run on, NetWare makes more efficient use of</i><br>
<i>the available hardware, improves portability, and allows programs to run on mixed</i><br>
<i>networks tying together different platforms. This article shows you how to get started</i><br>
<i>with NLM development.</i>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Novell's NetWare has been around for years, and is considered by many to be the<br>
networking standard in the DOS/Windows world. NetWare servers have always been<br>
able to handle AppleTalk clients, too, but they have not been as prevalent in<br>
predominantly Macintosh environments. As a result, most Macintosh developers have<br>
never had the need or inclination to learn how to write software for NetWare servers.<br>
With Apple's NetWare for PowerPCTM, you can now port your existing network<br>
products, or create new ones, to run on Apple Workgroup Servers under NetWare.
</p>
<p>
In this article, we'll take a brief tour of the NetWare environment and what it takes to<br>
write software for it. The article is intended primarily for developers of networking<br>
software, particularly running on networks using Apple Workgroup Servers or<br>
multiple platforms -- but you should also find it of interest if you're just curious<br>
about NetWare or want to know about the available options for writing networking<br>
software.
</p>
<p>
NetWare is a<i>network operating system,</i> a framework for providing network services.<br>
Instead of running application programs, NetWare runs<i>NetWare loadable modules,</i> or<br>
<i>NLMs,</i> which typically implement network-based services such as file storage,<br>
printing, and electronic mail. An NLM can be loaded either on demand or automatically,<br>
and uses the NetWare Operating System (NOS) to allocate memory, communicate with<br>
clients, and interact with the underlying hardware. Once loaded, an NLM becomes an<br>
integral part of the operating system, with no architectural "middlemen" to slow it<br>
down. Figure 1 shows an overview of the NetWare architecture.
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;The information in this article </b>is based on Apple's NetWare for PowerPC, an<br>
implementation of Novell's NetWare 4.1. Earlier versions of NetWare are still in wide<br>
use, but NetWare 4.0 added some new features such as directory services and<br>
improved security. NetWare 4.1 is a more robust version of 4.0 and improves still<br>
further on these new features. Though earlier versions of NetWare client software can<br>
connect to NetWare 4.1 networks, they may not be able to use all the features of the<br>
available NLMs. If you want your NLMs to support all versions of NetWare clients, the<br>
NOS provides the necessary support libraries.*

<h2>WHY NETWARE?</h2>
<p>
If you're a Macintosh developer, why should you make the leap to NetWare<br>
development? To make your product available to the greatest number of users.<br>
NetWare is used on more than 60% of all servers in the DOS-compatible world. Here<br>
are some of the reasons NetWare is so popular.
</p>
<p>
<b>EFFICIENT RESOURCE ALLOCATION</b><br>
In a typical Macintosh network installation, a single server machine provides file<br>
storage, printing service, a mail server, and maybe even a scheduling server or other<br>
network services. Any one of these services might deliver acceptable performance on<br>
its own; but when you try to put them all on the same "box," they must contend for<br>
limited resources such as processor time, memory, and disk access. The result is that<br>
they all suffer performance degradation: even on a blindingly fast machine, such<br>
resource contention can slow all of your network services to a crawl.
</p>
<p>
NetWare helps alleviate this problem in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>OS-level resource access. Unlike other operating systems (such as<br>
UNIX&#174;), NetWare has no protection scheme to prevent a process from<br>
accessing memory outside its domain. Once loaded, NLMs become part of the<br>
operating system itself, with unrestricted access to memory and other<br>
hardware resources. NLMs run faster without the overhead associated with<br>
memory protection. The cost, of course, is that an unprotected NLM can bring<br>
the entire system down if it crashes.</li>
<li>"Lightweight" threads.  The NOS is multithreaded, with threads from<br>
NLMs existing alongside those belonging to the system itself. Because they<br>
operate at the system level, NLM threads carry very little overhead and can be<br>
spawned, executed, and switched very quickly.</li>
<li>Nonpreemptive multitasking.  NetWare is a nonpreemptive multitasking<br>
system: the burden of deciding when to switch threads is placed on the<br>
individual NLMs, rather than on the operating system itself. So long as all<br>
NLMs are "good citizens," they can work cooperatively to produce a more<br>
efficient system.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>CENTRALIZED DIRECTORY SERVICES</b><br>
One of the biggest headaches for many network administrators is maintaining user and<br>
group lists for multiple servers and services. A single user may have an account on<br>
two or three file servers, a mail server, and who-knows-what else. Keeping the<br>
different accounts for that one person up to date can be a significant chore.
</p>
<p>
NetWare helps ease this burden by making centralized directory services available to<br>
all NLMs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NetWare users log directly into the network itself, not into a particular<br>
server. Using interfaces that NetWare provides, NLMs can access the directory<br>
services and use them for authentication. Thus a mail server and a file server, for<br>
example, can share the same user list instead of each maintaining its own. This<br>
centralized approach to directory services benefits everyone. NLM developers don't<br>
have to write the code to store, edit, and maintain their own user lists; network<br>
administrators only need to maintain a single centralized directory; and users don't<br>
have to remember half a dozen different passwords and authenticate themselves every<br>
time they move from one network service to another.
</p>
<p>
<b>PORTABILITY</b><br>
Networks are growing larger everywhere, as users discover that computers linked<br>
together, sharing services over a network, are far more useful than isolated<br>
workstations. While this growth presents many opportunities for developers of<br>
network services, it also presents the problem of diversity. The days are gone when a<br>
company's computers all ran the same operating system. Today, Macintosh computers,<br>
DOS-based PCs, and UNIX workstations must all coexist on the same network.
</p>
<p>
Porting a network service such as a mail server from one hardware platform to<br>
another can take a great deal of time and effort. Building your server as an NLM,<br>
however, gives it instant portability to any platform for which NetWare is<br>
implemented. NetWare's uniform API "virtualizes the hardware," so that NLMs don't<br>
have to interact directly with the platform they're running on. Since the interface to<br>
NetWare is the same from one platform to another, porting your NLM is a simple<br>
matter of recompiling.
</p>
<h2>THE RIGHT TOOLS FOR THE JOB</h2>
<p>
By now you should be convinced that NetWare has a lot of advantages to offer. The rest<br>
of this article details what it takes to build an NLM that will run on NetWare for<br>
PowerPC. Included on this issue's CD is sample code for a simple multithreaded NLM.
</p>
<h2>CHOOSING A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p>
If you're already developing software for Power Macintosh computers, you probably<br>
have most of the tools you need to develop software for NetWare for PowerPC. In the<br>
next section, we'll see how to use these tools to do NetWare development in a Macintosh<br>
environment; but there are non- Macintosh options as well:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have an IBM RS/6000 computer, you can use the<b>cset</b> compiler to<br>
develop your NetWare NLMs. (You'll need version 2.1.1 or later of the<br>
compiler, which can generate PowerPC code.) This is the method Apple used to<br>
port many of the NLMs that are part of NetWare itself.</li>
<li>If you have a DOS-compatible machine, you may be able to use Novell's<br>
UnixWare in conjunction with the Cygnus C/C++ Compiler for PowerPC (a<br>
PowerPC version of<b>gcc</b>). You should have at least an 80386 processor for<br>
this option, but an 80486 or Pentium is recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you already have the hardware and software, either of these non-Macintosh options<br>
can help you quickly begin producing high-quality code. But if you aren't already using<br>
an RS/6000 or a DOS- compatible system, you'll probably do better to go the<br>
Macintosh route. Purchasing an RS/6000 can be quite expensive, not to mention the<br>
additional cost of setup and maintenance. You can get DOS- compatible machines for<br>
much less, but not all of them are compatible with UnixWare. (Any certified<br>
UnixWare reseller should be able to help you determine whether UnixWare will run<br>
on your hardware.)
</p>
<p>
This article will focus exclusively on Macintosh development options. However,<br>
general information about NetWare's interfaces applies to any development platform<br>
you choose.
</p>
<p>
<b>NETWARE DEVELOPMENT THE MACINTOSH WAY</b><br>
MPW Pro (available from APDA) includes a PowerPC C/C++ compiler and linker that<br>
run as tools under Macintosh Programmer's Workshop (MPW). The compiler, PPCC,<br>
produces PowerPC object (.o) files, which you then pass to the PPCLink tool to<br>
produce an XCOFF (eXtended Common Object File Format) file.
</p>
<p>
Ordinarily, the next step would be to pass the XCOFF file, in turn, to the MakePEF tool,<br>
which turns it into a PEF (Preferred Executable Format) file ready to run as a<br>
Macintosh application. To build an NLM, however, you don't use MakePEF. Instead, you<br>
pass your object files to a special- purpose NLM linker that translates them into a<br>
finished NLM, using information about imports and exports taken from a<i>definition file</i><br>
you supply. (See the next section for more information on the structure and contents<br>
of the definition file.) You invoke the NLM linker with an MPW script, NLMLink. As<br>
shown in Figure 2, you pass it your definition file along with the usual PowerPC<br>
runtime library, PPCRuntime.o, and another library, Prelude.o (provided with the<br>
NetWare for PowerPC Software Development Kit), that allows NetWare to load your<br>
NLM. The NLMLink script can also accept a list of .o files as arguments, in which case<br>
it calls the standard PowerPC linker, PPCLink, for you.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;To run and test your NLMs, you'll need the developer's version of NetWare for<br>
PowerPC from Novell. You can install it on any Power Macintosh computer.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE DEFINITION FILE</b><br>
In addition to your NLM's object (.o) files, you must provide the NLMLink tool with a<br>
definition (.def) file. This file, which is usually named<i>NLMName</i> .def (where<i>NLMName</i><br>
is the name of your NLM), contains information that NLMLink needs in order to turn<br>
your linked object file into a finished NLM. Among other things, the definition file<br>
includes a list of all routines imported to and exported from your NLM. Listing 1<br>
shows an example definition file, taken from the sample NLM on this issue's CD.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The keywords <b>description, copyright,</b> and <b> version</b> give the information that<br>
will be displayed on the NetWare console when the NLM is loaded.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 2. </b>Building an NLM with MPW
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The keyword <b>reentrant</b> specifies that the NLM can be loaded multiple times on the<br>
console, but only one copy of the NLM will reside in memory, with all threads sharing<br>
that same copy of the code.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The keywords <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> tell the linker what file or files to read and what to<br>
name the file it produces.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The keywords <b>start</b> and <b> exit</b> identify routines to execute when the NLM is loaded and<br>
unloaded, respectively. The Prelude.o file that you pass to the NLMLink tool defines<br>
default start and exit routines, named _Prelude and _Stop, to set up your NLM's<br>
threads at load time and clean them up at unload. If your NLM is reentrant, you'll<br>
probably supply a start routine of your own to handle reentrant loading; if not, you<br>
can just omit the<b>start</b>keyword (to use the default start routine_Prelude).&nbsp;&nbsp;If you<br>
define your own start routine, make sure it calls _Prelude the first time your NLM is<br>
loaded.
</p>
<p>
The keyword <b>import</b> is followed by a list of the routines that your NLM needs to have<br>
available at run time. These routines usually come from the NetWare C Interface, but<br>
they could be exported by any other NLM running on the server. Any routine your code<br>
calls that is not part of your NLM must be listed here, or the NLMLink tool will report<br>
an error.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the keyword <b>export</b> is followed by a list of the routines that your NLM makes<br>
available for other NLMs on the server to call. You need not export any routines at all;<br>
however, if you want to give other NLMs access to any of your routines, you must list<br>
them here. (Our sample NLM doesn't actually export any routines, but we've included a<br>
fictitious one in the sample definition file, just for illustration.)
</p>
<p>
These are just some of the keywords you can use in a definition file. The NetWare for<br>
PowerPC Software Development Kit documentation describes all of the possible<br>
keywords and how to use them.

<h2>A BRIEF TOUR OF THE NETWARE INTERFACE</h2>
<p>
The NetWare C Interface provides more than 1000 functions for interfacing with the<br>
NOS. It's a load-time interface, meaning that function calls are resolved at the time an<br>
NLM is loaded rather than at link time. Trying to document the entire NetWare<br>
interface here would be like trying to summarize all of<i>Inside Macintosh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i> We can,<br>
however, look at some highlights. The NLMs that make up the NetWare C Interface<br>
include, among others, CLIB (<b>C LIB</b>rary), DSAPI (<b>D</b>irectory<b>S</b>ervices<b>API</b>), <br>
THREADS, NWSNUT (<b>N</b>et<b>W</b>are<b> S</b>cree<b>N UT</b>ility), and TLI (<b>T</b>ransport<b>L</b>ayer<br>
<b>I</b>nterface).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, these NLMs offer interfaces to the following NetWare services:
</p>
<ul>
<li>high- and low-level I/O</li>
<li>directory services</li>
<li>file manipulation</li>
<li>memory management</li>
<li>threads</li>
<li>communications protocols</li>
<li>math functions</li>
<li>human interface utilities</li>
</ul>
<p>
These services (which are described in more detail below) are actually only a few of<br>
thoseavailable through the NetWare C Interface. Currently, more than 40 different<br>
services(analogous to Macintosh Toolbox managers) are available to developers of<br>
NLMs. The NetWare for PowerPC Software Development Kit contains documentation on<br>
all of these services, as well as the latest development utilities and sample code.
</p>
<p>
<b>INPUT/OUTPUT</b><br>
NetWare provides APIs for both synchronous and asynchronous I/O.
</p>
<p>
<b>DIRECTORY SERVICES</b><br>
The Directory Services API provides access to the distributed directory services<br>
database on a NetWare 4.1 network. NetWare directory services offer functionality<br>
very similar to that of the Apple Open Collaboration Environment (AOCE) -- in fact,<br>
Apple and Novell are pursuing ways to integrate the two services. Typical calls include<br>
NWDSAuthenticate, NWDSCreateObject, and NWDSSearch.
</p>
<p>
<b>FILE MANIPULATION</b><br>
NetWare provides several sets of interfaces for file manipulation. Calls such as open,<br>
fopen, DFSOpen, and AFPOpenFileFork all open a disk file, but take different<br>
parameters and follow different I/O models. You decide which you need, depending on<br>
whether you want speed, convenience, or compatibility.
</p>
<p>
<b>MEMORY MANAGEMENT</b><br>
NetWare uses the standard C malloc/free model for memory management. NetWare<br>
doesn't use a virtual-memory scheme to increase a server's memory capacity beyond<br>
that of the available physical RAM, so you must be careful to allocate only as much<br>
memory as you actually intend to use. It's also a good idea to include code for handling<br>
low-memory conditions in a graceful way.
</p>
<p>
<b>THREADS</b><br>
NetWare is a nonpreemptive operating system, meaning that each NLM is responsible<br>
for voluntarily giving up control of the processor from time to time, to allow other<br>
NLMs to run. Every NLM has at least one thread of execution, known as the<i>main thread,</i><br>
created when the NLM is initially loaded. The NLM can then optionally spawn as many<br>
additional threads as it needs. At any given time, exactly one thread is in active control<br>
of theprocessor; all others are temporarily suspended. The NOS maintains a<i>run queue</i><br>
of such suspended threads awaiting execution.
</p>
<p>
The NetWare interface provides a set of routines for thread management, including<br>
BeginThread, Delay, EnterCritSec, and ThreadSwitch. The "good citizen" routines<br>
CYieldIfNeeded, CYieldWithDelay, and CYieldUntilIdle yield control of the processor to<br>
give other NLMs their turn at bat. In addition, many other system calls automatically<br>
block (suspend the execution of a thread) while waiting for some external occurrence<br>
such as the arrival of a packet on the network, so it isn't always necessary to<br>
relinquish the processor explicitly.
</p>
<p>
<b>COMMUNICATIONS</b><br>
NetWare's AppleTalk interface implements all of the protocols defined in<i>Inside</i><br>
<i>AppleTalk,</i> from the Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP) to the AppleTalk Filing<br>
Protocol (AFP). NetWare also provides native interfaces to IPX/SPX and TCP/IP. For<br>
greater flexibility, you can use the NetWare Transport Layer Interface (TLI). Because<br>
TLI functions are independent of the underlying transport layer, they allow you to use<br>
a variety of protocols, such as AppleTalk, IPX/SPX, and TCP/IP, without having to<br>
write extra code.
</p>
<p>
<b>MATH FUNCTIONS</b><br>
The Math Services API provides common mathematical functions like min, sqrt, and<br>
cos. For maximum efficiency, the implementation on PowerPC servers uses the<br>
processor's built-in floating- point capabilities whenever possible.
</p>
<p>
<b>HUMAN INTERFACE UTILITIES</b><br>
Many NLMs present a human interface on the server machine, allowing an operator or<br>
administrator to perform needed server-management tasks. If you want your NLM to<br>
have a graphical (as opposed to a command-line) interface, you can use the NetWare<br>
NLM User Interface Services to create windows, menus, and dialog boxes on the server<br>
console. Although the interfaces aren't as sophisticated as those of the Macintosh<br>
Toolbox, they can help you provide a convenient human interface to your NLM.
</p>
<h2>A SIMPLE NLM</h2>
<p>
To illustrate how NLMs are written, we'll look at two examples. Both will run on any<br>
server running NetWare. You'll find the code for both examples on this issue's CD.
</p>
<p>
Our first sample NLM is the obligatory "Hello, world" example, which we'll name<br>
HELLO.NLM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The code is short enough that we can show it right here:
</p>
<pre>/* HELLO.NLM
    This NLM prints the traditional message "Hello, world."
    on the serve console. Type "Load Hello" on the server
    to see it run.
*/
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
main()
    {
    printf("Hello, world.\n");
    }</pre>
<p>
Pretty painless, right? The reason for including this example is to show that writing<br>
an NLM doesn't require you to learn an entirely new programming method. Much of the<br>
programming you do when writing an NLM is the same as if you were writing an<br>
application for Macintosh or UNIX.
</p>
<h2>A MORE INTERESTING NLM</h2>
<p>
Now let's look at another sample NLM, named ATDEMO.NLM. When loaded on your<br>
server, ATDEMO watches for an incoming AppleTalk connection and provides the client<br>
with server statistics on request, such as the number of clients connected, directory<br>
listings, and so forth. (The CD also contains a small Macintosh client application that<br>
connects to the server and queries ATDEMO for this information. The client application<br>
is provided in "fat binary" form so that it can run in native mode on both PowerPC and<br>
680x0 platforms. We won't examine its code in this article, but it's included on the CD<br>
in case you're interested.)
</p>
<p>
ATDEMO demonstrates three important points about writing NLMs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>how to make calls to the NetWare C Interface</li>
<li>how to use the AppleTalk protocol in an NLM</li>
<li>how to create and schedule threads for execution by the NOS</li>
</ul>
<p>
The code for the entire NLM is contained in a single file, ATDemo.c. It begins with a list<br>
of #include macros. Some of these, such as stdio.h and stdlib.h, are standard ANSI<br>
includes. Others, such as nwenvrn.h, nwthread.h, and nbp.h, are headers for the NOS.<br>
Remember that all routines you call from these header files, even the ANSI C routines,<br>
are linked at load time and implemented by the NLMs described earlier. <i>Do not</i> use the<br>
ANSI headers from your MPW CIncludes folder -- there may be subtle differences in<br>
the header files that could cause debugging nightmares later on.
</p>
<p>
Like all C programs, an NLM written in C must have a main routine. Macintosh<br>
applications typically have a structure based on a main event loop:
</p>
<pre>main()
    {
        /* Do preliminary setup and initialization. */
        ...
       
        do {
            ...
            WaitNextEvent(...);
            ...
        } while (1);
       
        /* Do final cleanup and exit. */
        ...
    }</pre>
<p>
The structure of an NLM is a bit different, because the server itself is doing the event<br>
processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of polling the system for events and processing them one at a time<br>
in our main thread, we block for action and spawn a separate thread to handle each<br>
incoming event. This removes the bottleneck associated with a single point of event<br>
processing, with each spawned thread doing its own work and blocking only for its own<br>
needs. 
</p>
<p>
The structure of ATDEMO looks like this:
</p>
<pre>main()
    {
        /* Do preliminary setup and initialization. */
        ...
       
        do {
            ATAtpGet(...);
            ...
            BeginThread(...);
        } while (1);

        /* Do final cleanup and exit. */
        ...
    }</pre>
<p>
At first glance, our NLM seems to spend all its time in a busy <b>do-while</b> loop. In fact,<br>
this is not the case. ATAtpGet is a NOS function that waits to receive an ATP (AppleTalk<br>
Transaction Protocol) packet. Like many other functions in the NetWare C Interface,<br>
ATAtpGet is a <i>blocking function:</i> it suspends execution of the calling thread while<br>
waiting for an ATP packet to arrive, allowing the NOS to run other scheduled threads in<br>
the meantime. The thread calling the blocking function gets placed at the end of the run<br>
queue; eventually it will work its way back to the front of the queue and resume<br>
execution from the point of the suspension. (If our NLM didn't call such a blocking<br>
function, we could instead call ThreadSwitchWithDelay at the end of our <b>do-while</b><br>
loop, to relinquish control of the processor explicitly and allow other threads to run.)
</p>
<p>
When the server eventually receives an ATP packet addressed to our NLM, it<br>
reactivates our main thread, causing control to return from the ATAtpGet call and<br>
resume with the next instruction. Our NLM next calls the NOS function BeginThread to<br>
create a new thread to respond to the packet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual code issues this call by means<br>
of a subsidiary function, SpinNewSession:
</p>
<pre>int SpinNewSession(...)
    {
        int completionCode;
   
        completionCode = BeginThread(HandleClientSession, ...);
        return completionCode;     
    }</pre>
<p>
BeginThread takes a function pointer as its main parameter, creates a new thread to<br>
execute the function, and adds the thread to the NOS's run queue. When the time comes<br>
to run this thread, the NOS will call the specified function (in this case, an ATDEMO<br>
function named HandleClientSession). Thus, instead of a single thread of execution that<br>
handles all communications with all clients, we have a main thread that waits for new<br>
clients to initiate communications and spins off a subsidiary thread for each such<br>
client connection.
</p>
<p>
Like our main function, HandleClientSession also has a<b>do-while</b>loop that uses<br>
ATAtpGet as the main blocking function:
</p>
<pre>void HandleClientSession(...)
    {
        /* Allocate data structures and open a connection. */
        ...
       
        ATAtpSendRsp(...);
       
        do {
            ATAtpGet(...);
            quitRequest = HandleRequest(...);
            if (quitRequest) {
                ATAtpClose(...);
                ExitThread();
            }
        } while (1);
    }</pre>
<p>
ATAtpGet will continue getting packets from the client until the client notifies the<br>
server to break the connection. Each time HandleClientSession receives a packet, it<br>
calls another ATDEMO function, HandleRequest, to examine the content of the message<br>
and determine what specific information the client is requesting. When HandleRequest<br>
reports that the client has asked to break the connection, HandleClientSession calls the<br>
NOS function ATAtpClose to close the connection and then destroys the thread with the<br>
NOS function ExitThread.

<h2>NETWARE DEVELOPMENT TIPS</h2>
<p>
Here are some key points to keep in mind when writing an NLM or porting an existing<br>
program to NetWare.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't rule out a NetWare version of your software just because it's not<br>
"real Macintosh." Apple's future plans for client/server solutions feature<br>
NetWare as a core OS.</li>
<li>Try to make your NLM platform-independent, if possible. If you avoid the<br>
platform-specific features of NetWare for PowerPC, you'll be able to port<br>
your NLM to NetWare running on other platforms, including DOS-compatible<br>
machines, with little effort.</li>
<li>Remember that your NLM runs on a server that handles many different<br>
clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to make it compatible with clients of any type.</li>
<li>If your NLM is intended to run on multiple platforms or support multiple<br>
transport protocols, use the NetWare Transport Layer Interface (TLI) rather<br>
than native protocols. This will save you time and effort when porting to<br>
another platform.</li>
<li>Be careful when developing NLMs with a Macintosh development<br>
environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're writing an application that has no Macintosh Toolbox<br>
underneath: use only the headers and libraries that come with the NetWare for<br>
PowerPC Software Development Kit.</li>
<li>Test your NLM carefully and extensively. While in development, an NLM<br>
can be run in isolation, where it can't damage anything but itself. Once it's<br>
ready for prime time, it will be loaded as part of the NOS; then if it crashes, it<br>
may bring the entire server down with it.</li>
<li>NetWare is a nonpreemptive multitasking operating system. Be sure to<br>
design your threads of execution so that they relinquish the processor<br>
frequently, to give other NLMs their fair share of processor time.</li>
<li>Because NetWare servers have no virtual memory, they're limited to the<br>
physical memory available in the computer. Don't be a memory pig!</li>
<li>Be sure to take advantage of the numerous developer programs and<br>
information available from Apple and Novell.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once you've finished developing and testing your NLM, you'll probably want to get it<br>
certified by Novell before you release it to the world. Following the guidelines above<br>
will help make that process as speedy and painless as possible.
</p>
<h2>WHAT NEXT?</h2>
<p>
This article should give you enough basic information to get started with NetWare and<br>
NLMs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Novell recommends that anyone interested in setting up a NetWare system hire<br>
a trained specialist called a Certified NetWare Engineer, or CNE, to help with the<br>
installation. Many NetWare developers also attend training classes to learn how to port<br>
their existing software or develop new NLMs. If you don't want to go to the time and<br>
expense of a training course, a couple of good books can go a long way to help you learn<br>
what you need to know. See the list at the end of this article for some suggestions.
</p>
<p>
Before embarking on serious development, you'll definitely want to get Novell's<br>
NetWare for PowerPC Software Development Kit (which should be available soon if not<br>
by the time you read this). In it you'll find a complete set of software and<br>
documentation to assist you in developing your own NLMs. For more information, call<br>
Novell at 1-800-NETWARE (1-800-638-9273). For information from Apple on<br>
NetWare developer programs, call Apple's Developer Support Center at<br>
(408)974-4897 or send a message to AppleLink DEVSUPPORT. In today's networking<br>
environment,&nbsp;&nbsp;more and more products, especially client/server programs, are being<br>
written for multiple platforms. NetWare gives you a convenient way to develop<br>
portable network software without having to rewrite all your code separately for each<br>
new platform. Whether you're porting an existing network application or writing a<br>
new one, you can benefit greatly by doing it in NetWare.

<b>JAMIE OSBORNE </b>(AppleLink JWO) In the short space of a year, Jamie Osborne has<br>
gone from doing three-dimensional user interfaces to working on exception-handling<br>
routines for a PowerPC Memory Manager to programming NetWare NLMs. When he's<br>
not sitting in front of a computer (which, according to his fianc&#201;e, is "only when he's<br>
sleeping, and maybe not even then"), he keeps busy writing television scripts for<br>
Paramount to reject.&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn't quite figured out what he<i>really </i> wants to do with his<br>
life, but he's reasonably certain&nbsp;&nbsp;it involves long days lounging about in a large house<br>
in the hills of New Hampshire.*
