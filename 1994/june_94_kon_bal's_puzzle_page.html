</p>
<p>
KON With all the talk of PowerPC, I should give you one of the really nasty PowerPC<br>
bugs I've been working on. But to be fair to those who aren't up to speed yet, namely<br>
one BAL, I'll give you a bug that's right up your alley.
</p>
<p>
BAL You're a saint.
</p>
<p>
KON Have you heard of the Display Enabler software that went out with the new<br>
17-inch Multiple Scan display and is part of System 7.5? It lets you dynamically<br>
change your monitor configurations, such as your menu bar screen and resolution on<br>
Multiple Scan displays.
</p>
<p>
BAL You mean I can Option-drag the menu bar across screens in the Monitors control<br>
panel and it changes dynamically? Totally cool! I hate that "takes effect on restart"<br>
stuff. This means that I can help out all those multimedia applications that don't<br>
understand my second monitor is color.
</p>
<p>
KON And if you get one of the Multiple Scan displays, you can double-click on a screen<br>
in Monitors and change its resolution on the fly. Last time I saw someone try that on a<br>
Windows machine, it crashed!
</p>
<p>
BAL Give 'em ten more years, I'm sure they'll get it right.
</p>
<p>
KON With Display Enabler, the system automatically keeps windows on the screen<br>
when you move the menu bar. It even moves your icons to reasonable positions. If<br>
you're using the new scriptable Finder, the icon relocation is awesome. Sometimes I<br>
get the feeling it can read my mind.
</p>
<p>
BAL Wait. Are you running a Macintosh or a Newton?
</p>
<p>
KON Ha ha.
</p>
<p>
BAL OK, back to the puzzle. What's the bug? Was there trouble with applications that<br>
hide windows by moving them off the screen? Those windows wouldn't be able to be<br>
locat - ed after being moved along with the menu bar.
</p>
<p>
KON We handle that case for the most part, although that's a pretty cheesy way of<br>
hiding windows. Apparently some developers have trouble figuring out what ShowHide<br>
does. The bug I have for you is way better than that.
</p>
<p>
BAL Yeah, sure. It probably only happens on a particular machine, in one magic case<br>
that's really hard to reproduce, and only when MacsBug isn't loaded.
</p>
<p>
KON No fair. You've played this game before. Actually, someone reported that when you<br>
change the resolution of a monitor and then try to restart, the machine hangs on boot.
</p>
<p>
BAL Well, it's a good thing monitor reconfigurations take effect without restarting,<br>
since restarting doesn't work anymore! Does it happen if I don't have Display Enabler<br>
installed?
</p>
<p>
KON Without Display Enabler, you can't change the resolution of the monitor. Solve the<br>
problem.
</p>
<p>
BAL Only under protest. How far does he get when he tries to reboot?
</p>
<p>
KON Smiley Mac and that's it. It dies right about where you would expect the death<br>
chimes.
</p>
<p>
BAL And it only happens on this one machine?
</p>
<p>
KON When we tried to reproduce it on an identical configuration we couldn't.
</p>
<p>
BAL What's his configuration?
</p>
<p>
KON Macintosh Quadra 900, on-board video connected to a 17-inch Multiple Scan<br>
display, two hard drives, and System 7.1 with Display Enabler.
</p>
<p>
BAL How does he regain access to his machine?
</p>
<p>
KON He resets parameter RAM (PRAM) by holding down Command-Option-P-R until<br>
the machine chimes the second time. Then everything boots fine.
</p>
<p>
BAL But it boots into the default video mode, not the one he specified in Monitors.
</p>
<p>
<b>100</b> KON Of course. Because the original Macintosh was floppy-based, PRAM was<br>
added to hold a lot of system configuration information, such as mouse speed,<br>
double-click time, and sound volume for each monitor. That way you could boot off of<br>
different floppies and still maintain all your system preferences.
</p>
<p>
BAL The Macintosh II extended the use of PRAM to add support for multiple video cards<br>
and slot devices. Since PRAM is in such short supply, there's also a 'scrn' resource<br>
that's maintained by Monitors that contains the relative locations of the different mon<br>
- itors, as well as each monitor's mode. The problem is that the 'scrn' resource and<br>
your PRAM are out of sync, so the system gets confused and hangs. Go fix your bug.<br>
Over.
</p>
<p>
<b>90</b> KON Nice theory, but wrong. First of all, we restart right after closing Monitors.<br>
The last thing Monitors does is update the 'scrn' resource and tell the driver to update<br>
its PRAM settings. So there's not much chance for them to get out of sync. Second, the<br>
'scrn' resource is read and acted upon at extension loading time, and we're hanging way<br>
before that.
</p>
<p>
BAL So something that's getting written to PRAM must be causing all the fuss. On his<br>
machine, use the DPRAM dcmd to check the PRAM locations related to video before and<br>
after changing the mode. To factor Monitors out of the equation, boot and set the PRAM<br>
locations by hand and see if that's the only dependency.
</p>
<p>
KON Slick sleuthing, BAL! It turns out that PRAM location that holds the new mode for<br>
the on-board video (in your case, $49) gets changed. If you change it using the SPRAM<br>
dcmd rather than Monitors, the problem still occurs.
</p>
<p>
BAL Drat. I was hoping that Monitors was somehow trashing the startup drive PRAM<br>
loca - tion. I've always been looking for a good excuse to rewrite Monitors out of that<br>
Pascal morass. This certainly narrows it down.
</p>
<p>
KON If you say so. But you can only get it to happen on this one machine, and how could<br>
video PRAM be related to booting, anyway?
</p>
<p>
BAL It's going to be hard to get MacsBug involved since we're too early in the boot pro<br>
- cess.
</p>
<p>
KON You could get MacsBug-like capabilities at boot time using BootBug, but there's no<br>
card around.
</p>
<p>
BAL So what's special about this configuration? Is it a prototype 17-inch Multiple<br>
Scan dis - play?
</p>
<p>
KON Nope. He claims to be using a production unit.
</p>
<p>
BAL What if you remove the extra hard drive?
</p>
<p>
<b>85</b> KON It boots fine. No problem.
</p>
<p>
BAL You mean if I just turn off the external drive, the machine boots fine?
</p>
<p>
KON Yep.
</p>
<p>
BAL What if I set the system to boot off of the external drive?
</p>
<p>
KON There's no system on the external drive. But you can tell the system to set the<br>
startup disk there. It's not as if it checks for a valid boot volume or anything. I've<br>
heard you can even set it to boot off of a Sega CD.
</p>
<p>
BAL So I put a system on there and set it as the boot drive. What happens?
</p>
<p>
<b>80</b> KON It boots fine.
</p>
<p>
BAL But if I set the boot drive back to the internal drive, I crash?
</p>
<p>
KON Nope. That seems to be working fine now too.
</p>
<p>
BAL Aha! I'll remove the system from the external drive and try to reboot. Now I<br>
crash, right?
</p>
<p>
<b>75</b> KON Nope. The system seems to be booting fine now. Nice going, BAL! You fixed the<br>
only reproducible case! Could you recap the symptom and the fix so that I can just add<br>
them to the Read Me file and be done with it?
</p>
<p>
BAL Yeah, yeah. Somehow something must have changed on that external disk. Maybe<br>
the Finder wrote out some new boot blocks or removed some stale boot blocks when I<br>
trashed the System file. Can we put the disk back to its original state?
</p>
<p>
<b>70</b> KON We'll break into our hermetically sealed digital fiberoptic wireless remote<br>
personal information highway archive server and restore your disk image. The<br>
machine still boots fine.
</p>
<p>
BAL If it's not the disk, I must have changed something in PRAM. What's the startup<br>
drive set to now and what was it when I dumped PRAM earlier?
</p>
<p>
<b>65</b> KON The long word that holds the boot drive (PRAM location $78-$7B) used to<br>
hold $0 and now it holds $FFFFFFDF (a driver refNum), which indicates that you're<br>
booting off the internal drive.
</p>
<p>
BAL What does $0 specify?
</p>
<p>
KON That's what PRAM gets set to when you don't select a boot drive in the Startup Disk<br>
control panel. It tells the system to go look for a valid boot drive and boot off of the<br>
first one it finds.
</p>
<p>
BAL When I set the boot drive to the internal drive using Startup Disk, the PRAM<br>
location was set. What happens if I set it back to $0?
</p>
<p>
<b>60</b> KON You hang on boot, same as before.
</p>
<p>
BAL What if you put a System Folder on the external drive but leave the PRAM boot<br>
drive set to $0?
</p>
<p>
<b>55</b> KON You don't hang anymore, and the system boots off of the external drive.
</p>
<p>
BAL And if I drag that System Folder to the trash?
</p>
<p>
<b>50</b> KON The system hangs on boot.
</p>
<p>
BAL What if I use a newly initialized external drive with the same SCSI ID?
</p>
<p>
<b>45</b> KON It boots fine.
</p>
<p>
BAL Let's recap for those just joining us. The machine hangs on boot on a two-drive <br>
system under these circumstances: the System Folder on the external drive has been<br>
deleted; there's no default boot drive selected; and the video mode of the on-board<br>
driver is set to something other than the default. Did I forget anything?
</p>
<p>
KON The solution.
</p>
<p>
BAL So how does the system go searching for boot drives?
</p>
<p>
<b>40</b> KON If the device specified in PRAM doesn't exist or isn't bootable, the boot code<br>
starts with the device with the highest SCSI ID and looks for boot blocks. If they exist,<br>
it tries to boot off of that drive. If it works, great. If there's no System Folder or<br>
Finder, it will start over with the next highest SCSI ID.
</p>
<p>
BAL I bet if I put the same SCSI driver on both disks using Apple HD SC Setup, the<br>
problem goes away.
</p>
<p>
KON You got a theory here, or what?
</p>
<p>
BAL Early in the boot process, the system heap is really small. When you put the video<br>
driver into one of the new modes tickled by Display Enabler, it loads patches out of<br>
ROM into the system heap. These patches fight with the SCSI driver for the limited<br>
system heap RAM. When no boot drive is selected, the boot code trolls the SCSI bus<br>
looking for a valid boot device. It loads the SCSI driver off the first candidate, starts<br>
booting, and finds there's no valid System Folder present. So it goes to the next drive,<br>
sees that there's a different SCSI driver version on it, and tries to load that version.<br>
Because the video driver loaded its extended tables and forgot to grow the system heap,<br>
the load fails and the system hangs without a clue as to how to proceed.
</p>
<p>
<b>35</b> KON Wow! Fabulous theory, but wrong. If you get BootBug -- a wonderful product<br>
for anyone wanting to debug system startup, by the way -- and watch the SCSI<br>
Manager allocate space for the driver, it succeeds. Furthermore, when the system fails<br>
to boot from the first drive it finds, it throws everything away by calling InitZone on<br>
the&nbsp;&nbsp;system heap zone and starts over with the next drive. Your story about the video<br>
driver patches is accurate, but there's still enough room in the system heap after they<br>
load. Your move.
</p>
<p>
BAL OK, I need some tools. What have you got? Do you expect me to debug this with my<br>
bare hands?
</p>
<p>
KON Well, we don't have an emulator handy, but we could probably call in a few favors<br>
and get a BootBug NuBus card.
</p>
<p>
BAL Now this should be easy! Where do I crash?
</p>
<p>
<b>30</b> KON You crash in code that's monkeying around with the low-memory glo
</p>
<p>
BALat $DD8, UniversalInfoPtr. It's the table that tells you everything you ever wanted<br>
to know about this machine's configuration: the clock speed, all kinds of I/O stuff, the<br>
kind of sound hardware, SCSI hardware, on-board video, and memory controller, the<br>
number of NuBus slots . . .
</p>
<p>
BAL OK, OK. What's the problem?
</p>
<p>
KON Well, it dereferences $DD8, makes some calculations with the offsets, and ends up<br>
with a bogus address and a bus error.
</p>
<p>
BALWhere does $DD8 point?
</p>
<p>
<b>25</b> KON Into RAM.
</p>
<p>
BAL That's strange. All that configuration information should be in ROM. I'll stop<br>
BootBug immediately and step spy on $DD8 to see who changes it.
</p>
<p>
<b>20</b> KON By the time BootBug comes in, the location is already changed.
</p>
<p>
BAL Wait, BootBug loads first. It should come in before any other slots get called.
</p>
<p>
<b>15</b> KON It works that way on the Macintosh Quadra 610, 650, and 800 models and<br>
later (including the AV models). But you're on a Quadra 900, and on-board video<br>
occupies the first NuBus slot. The video is already gray, so the primary INIT of the<br>
on-board video has already been called.
</p>
<p>
BAL If I don't set the new video mode, so that I boot successfully, where does $DD8<br>
point?
</p>
<p>
KON Into ROM.
</p>
<p>
BAL Aha! The video driver is doing something different because it sees it needs one of<br>
the extended modes. It must patch $DD8 to change the configuration information for the<br>
video display.
</p>
<p>
<b>10</b> KON So? What's wrong with patching? Why does it work when only one drive is<br>
involved?
</p>
<p>
BAL I got it! The video driver patches out $DD8 to replace the tables for the extended<br>
video modes. Then the boot code starts looking for a valid boot drive. It finds the<br>
external drive, which has valid boot blocks since it once had a system on it, and tries<br>
to boot off of that. When it realizes there's no valid System Folder on the disk, the<br>
machine performs a warm restart and tries the next drive.
</p>
<p>
<b>5</b> KON Nothing new here yet.
</p>
<p>
BAL The problem is that when the system restarts, it reinitializes the system heap, <br>
throwing out the video patches, but doesn't reinitialize $DD8 since that's set very<br>
early by the boot code to describe the type of machine that was detected. Now $DD8<br>
points to garbage. As soon as someone tries to reference $DD8 they get garbage,<br>
resulting in a bus error. The machine doesn't know what to do and locks up.
</p>
<p>
KON Why don't you get a system error or at least the death chimes?
</p>
<p>
BAL Since there's no way to draw to the screen until a video driver is successfully<br>
found and opened, the death chimes were designed to audibly indicate where in the boot<br>
process failure occurred. Once the video driver is successfully opened, the death<br>
chimes error handler is replaced with the standard system error handler. But when<br>
the external drive failed to boot, the video driver was thrown out and the error<br>
occurred before it was reopened, so no error message could be displayed.
</p>
<p>
KON Precisely. Since all the problems happen in ROM long before we can get control,<br>
unless we want to do one of those nasty Darin-changed-the-boot-blocks patches, we<br>
can't write those extended modes to PRAM. So we wait until the Display Enabler INIT<br>
loads to synchronize the display with the 'scrn' resource. Trying to debug things at<br>
boot time is hard enough, especially when they happen before BootBug loads.
</p>
<p>
BAL Nasty.
</p>
<p>
KON Yeah.
