In Issue 17, we told part 1 of the history of the dogcow. We'll warn you again: If you<br>
don't know what or who the dogcow is, or you don't care for Apple cultural minutiae,<br>
you should just flip past this column.
</p>
<p>
<b>DISTRIBUTION OF TECH NOTE #31</b><br>
We left off at the point where the former Macintosh Technical Note #31, "The<br>
Dogcow," had been created. The question then was how to distribute it. Mark Johnson<br>
and I both thought that since it was an April Fool's joke anyway, the best thing would<br>
be to just include it in the April monthly&nbsp;&nbsp;mailing to Apple Partners and Associates;<br>
we'd drop it from the subsequent batches, with the direct intent of making it a curio.<br>
The idea was that the people who were currently in the Macintosh&nbsp;&nbsp;community would<br>
get it and everyone else wouldn't. We very intentionally were trying to build an aura<br>
around it. The April 1989 mailing is the only time this Tech Note was ever in print<br>
under the&nbsp;&nbsp;official auspices of Apple.
</p>
<p>
There was a bit of a lag time between the writing of the Note and the actual release; by<br>
the time it went out, I actually had forgotten about it. The response was immediate and<br>
intense. Internally I received a couple of vaguely threatening calls from people<br>
claiming false ownership, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;overwhelming majority of people thought it was<br>
great. One gentleman in the developer community took offense saying that "dogcow" was<br>
too close to "Dachau" and showed how the note had&nbsp;&nbsp;underpinnings of anti-Semitism. (I<br>
showed this one to my Jewish father-in-law, who had to be resuscitated, he was<br>
laughing so hard.)
</p>
<p>
Aside from that, it really struck a chord with the developer community like nothing<br>
I've seen before or since. I received about 40 pieces of fan mail that month. Developer<br>
Technical Support (DTS) must have gone for a year before there was a batch of e-mail<br>
that didn't have a dogcow reference in it. In fact, to this day people say to me, "Mark<br>
Harlan? I know your name from Tech Notes" -- but it's the only one I ever wrote.
</p>
<p>
Then came the concept of a Developer CD as a vehicle for distributing Tech Notes<br>
electronically (along with sample code and more). I was overseeing that project, and<br>
immediately we had an&nbsp;&nbsp;interesting conundrum: We wanted all information in<br>
electronic format, yet what were we going to do with Tech Note #31? Merely slipping<br>
it into the Tech Notes stack seemed like disaster, but then it didn't really feel right to<br>
omit it.
</p>
<p>
Again, it was Mark Johnson who came to the rescue with the excellent idea of burying<br>
the Tech Note. So on the early CD, "Phil and Dave's Excellent CD," you have to go<br>
through a bizarre sequence of commands to bring it up. Even now, tradition requires<br>
that I not give the details, but it involves Shift-Option-clicking and typing "grazing off<br>
a cliff," and it emits "Moof!" and "Foom!" sounds. (For the "Moof!" sound we took a real<br>
cow and then Zz said "fff" into a MacRecorder; the"Foom!" is just the same sound<br>
played backwards.) It took a while for anyone to find the Note using any technique, and<br>
I've never heard of anyone doing it except through ResEdit.
</p>
<p>
The Note stayed on the first few Developer CDs. The access technique changed from disc<br>
to disc, and not even I knew how to do it after the original "Phil and Dave." Somewhere<br>
along the line the Note was dropped from the CD altogether.
</p>
<p>
<b>OTHER DOGCOW PARAPHERNALIA</b><br>
Bootleg T-shirts started appearing. There was an apartment near Apple headquarters<br>
that started flying a dogcow flag. The stack version of the Note had a watermarked<br>
background that someone removed pixel by pixel before posting it to the Internet.<br>
Several developers were nearly thrown out of a movie theater at MacHack for<br>
"Moofing" before a movie.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the Tech Note there are three pins: green background, the most common;<br>
red&nbsp;&nbsp;background with Kanji (the word on the pin actually is pronounced "Moo-aann!"<br>
because Japanese dogs don't woof, they say something like "aann-aann"); and the<br>
super-rare red background with "Moof!", which are misprints of the Kanji batch.<br>
Also, there's a dogcow window sticker. All of these were given away in DTS labs, and all<br>
but the window sticker have been collected up a long time ago.
</p>
<p>
If you think of the dogcow fathers as being Zz Zimmerman, Mark Johnson, and me,<br>
there's only one dogcow shirt that received our supervision and approval: the black<br>
DTS sweatshirt with the small dogcow on the chest (designed by Toni Trujillo). I also<br>
designed the graphic for a DTS gift that was a shoulder bag with all incarnations of the<br>
dogcow on it (flipped, rotated, and inverted). Unfortunately the bag was incredibly<br>
cheap and most of them have self-destructed.
</p>
<p>
Chris Derossi and Mary Burke designed a dogcow mousepad and even went so far as to<br>
call Pepsi- Cola to get the exact color of Mountain Dew green for the background. They<br>
made 500 of these and I wrote an insert that went into the packaging. Aside from the<br>
original Tech Note, it's the only thing I've ever written about dogcattle -- until these <br>
<i>develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;columns.
</p>
<p>
<b>DOGCOW TRIVIA</b><br>
Somewhere along the line I baptized the dogcow "Clarus." Of course she's a female, as<br>
are all cows; males would be referred to as dogbulls, but none exist because there are<br>
already bulldogs, and God doesn't like to have naming problems.
</p>
<p>
Now things are much bigger than they were then -- both in number of developers and<br>
number of Apple employees. The dogcow regularly appears on documents that are no<br>
longer connected to DTS, or in some cases (such as Scott Knaster's books) not even<br>
from Apple. In a sense, the dogcow has become mainstream; people are copying it --<br>
and that's exactly what I was fighting against in the first place (not to mention that<br>
she, and her "Moof!" cry, are bona fide trademarks of Apple Computer). To put a stop<br>
to all this, I'm threatening to kill her off, but<i>develop</i> 's editor has become such a fan<br>
that she's not sure she'll accept a "Dogcow is Dead" column. Stay tuned!

<b>MARK ("THE RED") HARLAN </b>went through extensive deprogramming after six<br>
years at Apple. Unfortunately, the therapy didn't hold and he has since joined yet<br>
another cult: General Magic. In a recent interview, Mark was asked if he had any words<br>
of wisdom on the dogcow. "Yeah. Warn everyone that both the dogcow logo and 'Moof!'<br>
are trademarks of Apple Computer. You don't <i> ever</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;want to be in the position of having<br>
to answer 'What are you in for?' with 'Bootleg T-shirts.'" *
