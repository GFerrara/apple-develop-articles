<b>NUMBER FORMATS FOLLOWUP</b><br>
Regarding the article "International Number Formatting" in&nbsp;&nbsp;develop Issue 16: I've<br>
written a&nbsp;&nbsp;freeResEdit editor ("FMAT Editor") that enables you to easily create Script<br>
Manager canonical formats and store them as resources. I hope you'll find it useful.<br>
-- Michael Hecht<br>
<p>
<i>The author of the article looked at your editor, and he thought it was so useful that he</i><br>
<i>submitted it to the CD. Thanks!</i><br>

<b>NEW FLOATING WDEF ON CD</b><br>
I'm the author of a freeware floating window WDEF known as the Infinity Windoid. It<br>
was one of the first such WDEFs to implement the System 7- style coloring of<br>
windows, tinge colors and all. It includes support for a title bar down the left side of a<br>
window, System 6's coloring of windows, multiple monitors via DeviceLoop, and<br>
checking the available colors in 8-bit mode to determine whether the title bar should<br>
be color.
</p>
<p>
I recently finished up version 2.5.1 of the WDEF, which adds the ability to have a grow<br>
box, a title string in the title bar, and a slightly different style of title bar.
</p>
<p>
Please consider including this WDEF with source code on your CD. An appropriate<br>
place for it would be with Dean Yu's floating windows code (Issue 15). Dean has stated<br>
that his WDEF is not highly robust, and providing my WDEF with the source would<br>
make a lot of sense. This would also help me meet my goal of making it available to as<br>
many Macintosh developers as possible.<br>
-- Troy Gaul
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for bringing your WDEF to our attention. We've included it with Issue 15's</i><br>
<i>floating windows code on this issue's CD. Dean has also tweaked the code again since his</i><br>
<i>last updates. Check it out!</i><br>

<b>GREAT MAG, BUT LOSE LEDGE</b><br>
My vote for your View From the Ledge column is: lose it! Dilbert (the comic strip by<br>
Scott Adams) does a much better job at commenting on the political and social<br>
structures of corporate America. Thanks for the fine publication. develop is the only<br>
periodical that doesn't end up in the trash after I read it. Keep up the good work.<br>
-- Dave Lamkins
</p>
<p>
<i>The editor thanks you for your kind words about&nbsp;&nbsp;develop. As the author of View From</i><br>
<i>the Ledge, I've been volunteered to address your remarks about that column.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Scott Adams is unquestionably a genius. He has a certain wit and control of the English</i><br>
<i>language that hasn't really been equaled since Shakespeare, and an artistic flair that</i><br>
<i>I'm certain makes all Florentines weep. There's simply no way I can compete with this</i><br>
<i>caliber of raw talent.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>No doubt Mr. Adams gets invitations to dine with the President. I've never met any of</i><br>
<i>the Presidents of Apple, let alone of the United States -- although John Sculley did pull</i><br>
<i>up next to me at a stoplight a few years ago, and I used to have a Jean-Louis Gass&#201;e</i><br>
<i>mask hanging in my cubicle.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Mr. Adams has the advantage of dealing with a world where the characters are</i><br>
<i>two-dimensional, all of their worst traits are brought to the forefront, and the</i><br>
<i>situations these characters get caught up in border on the absurd. None of those things</i><br>
<i>can be said about the real office environment.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Having said all that, we're putting View From the Ledge on ice after this issue, and the</i><br>
<i>thaw comes only if there's a chinook in the form of a strong reader response.-- Tao</i><br>
<i>Jones</i>

<b>MISSING CD? A ROYAL PAIN</b><br>
First, I'd like to say that I think&nbsp;&nbsp;develop is excellent. I await each issue with frenzied<br>
anticipation and find each one absorbing, informative, well written, and funny.
</p>
<p>
I'd also like to comment on the Bookmark CD. I can't, however, because we don't get it. I<br>
keep reading articles referring to "this issue's CD" and it's infuriating! We get our<br>
regular monthly Developer CD with Apple Directions but no develop CD. Is this because<br>
we're in England? Don't you like us any more? It's the royal family's fault, isn't it?<br>
They've made us look stupid. They're nothing to do with us, honest. We'd just like our<br>
CD.<br>
--Richard Gibson
</p>
<p>
<i>Some international developers receive develop without the Bookmark CD as part of a</i><br>
<i>mailing that includes the Developer CD and Apple Directions. Anyone who gets the</i><br>
<i>Developer CD doesn't need the Bookmark CD (see "This issue's CD" on the inside front</i><br>
<i>cover).</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>We still like our British readers, so from our standpoint you should have no gripe</i><br>
<i>with the royal family. Thanks for writing!</i><br>

CA 95014&nbsp;&nbsp;(AppleLink CROSE or JOHNSON.DK). All letters should include your name<br>
