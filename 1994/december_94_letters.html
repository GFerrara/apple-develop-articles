<b>PENMODE NOT FOR TEXT</b><br>
In the Macintosh Q &amp; A section of <i> develop </i> Issue 18, I noticed the suggestion to use<br>
PenMode(srcBic) for drawing white text on a black background. This is wrong; the<br>
desired result will be achieved by TextMode(srcBic). Hope this helps.<br>

<i>Thanks for the correction. Say, don't I recognize your name from an article in Issue</i><br>

<b>SLIME: IS IT SAFE?</b><br>
As I was reading <i>develop </i> Issue 18, I came across the green slime question in<br>
Macintosh Q &amp; A. A friend of mine has been looking for just this recipe, to help keep<br>
her preschool-aged daughter amused. However, after reading the recipe, I'm not going<br>
to forward it to my friend, because one of the ingredients, borax, is poisonous.
</p>
<p>
Now, I'm not a toxicologist, nor do I play one on TV, so I don't know exactly how toxic<br>
borax is. But I don't want to find out by letting anyone's children play with it (not even<br>
the nasty little feral children down the street). And what about people who screw up<br>
the recipe? Or decide to experiment with it? You didn't even tell them that straight<br>
borax is poisonous. And it's not like there's a big "Mr. Yuk" sticker on the box of<br>
Twenty-Mule Team, just those friendly-looking equines.
</p>
<p>
You and your staff do a fine job of technical presentation, and you have a process for<br>
technical review. You might consider a "toxicity review" before you publish any more<br>
recipes for nifty stuff that's not inherently edible. Ya never know.<br>
-- Greg Guerin
</p>
<p>
<i>I volunteer at the Exploratorium, a science museum in San Francisco, and we've been</i><br>
<i>handing out this slime for months to any kid who wants it. The recipe was acquired</i><br>
<i>from a grade-school teacher and is used in schools all over the country.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>A chemist at the Exploratorium told me that borax is toxic to about the same degree as</i><br>
<i>soap: if you eat enough of it, you'll probably get a belly ache. Any kid who's old enough</i><br>
<i>to have figured out that soap is yucky to eat is plenty old enough, in my opinion. It's my</i><br>
<i>sincere hope and belief that most </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;develop <i>readers have already reached that stage of</i><br>
<i>maturity.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>To be absolutely sure, I called the Poison Control center, and they said that to have any</i><br>
<i>toxic effect at all someone would have to eat an awful lot of it. They even told me I didn't</i><br>
<i>need to bother to wash my hands after handling it. I asked if the soap analogy was a good</i><br>
<i>one, and they said it was accurate.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>You might recommend corn starch and&nbsp;&nbsp;cold water to your friend. In the right</i><br>
<i>proportions (just enough water to get it all wet) it makes a very satisfying goop</i><br>
<i>(usually called "oobleck" by teachers, after Dr. Seuss) that's probably more</i><br>
<i>appropriate for very young children.</i><br>

<b>DOGCOW IN THINK REFERENCE</b><br>
I really enjoyed reading Mark Harlan's history of the dogcow in Issues 17 and 18 of <br>
<i>develop</i> . He states that Technical Note #31 has not been available for quite a while.<br>
That may be so, but something like this Tech Note is hiding inside the THINK Reference<br>
databases. Just do a search for "DogCow" and you'll find it.<br>
-- Robert Grimm
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for pointing out the dogcow lore in THINK Reference; I didn't know about that. I</i><br>
<i>especially like the part about how, since the dogcow is two-dimensional, she can face a</i><br>
<i>predator head-on to avoid being seen. Although that defensive maneuver sounds likely</i><br>
<i>enough, keep in mind that the dogcow information in THINK Reference is unauthorized</i><br>
<i>and has nothing to do with the Tech Note. The Tech Note gives lots more information,</i><br>
<i>and we're glad it remains as mysterious as ever.</i><br>

<b>PUZZLING OVER THE PUZZLE PAGE</b><br>
After reading Issue 17 of <i> develop</i> , I have a question. I'm not sure what the purpose is<br>
in calling KON &amp; BAL's page a Puzzle Page if it requires that you have access to certain<br>
obscure beta ROMs in order to solve the puzzle. Perhaps this is just sour grapes<br>
because I've never scored above 5? Sure, it still demonstrates various debugging<br>
techniques (although I'm not sure that iterative debugging with a reboot after each test<br>
is a very useful technique, and this seems quite common in the puzzle pages). But is it<br>
really a puzzle?<br>
-- Peter Lewis
</p>
<p>
<i>KON &amp; BAL chose the Puzzle Page format because they thought it was a fun way to give</i><br>
<i>people debugging tips. They don't expect readers to take the puzzle aspect of it</i><br>
<i>seriously; in fact, you're the first one we've ever heard from who has scored anything</i><br>
<i>besides 0.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>None of us were thrilled with Issue 17's puzzle, but, in KON's words, "There was a lot</i><br>
<i>of great stuff about how the Resource Manager works, locking down handles, and other</i><br>
<i>really useful advice. We try to demonstrate efficient and good debugging techniques."</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Want a better Puzzle Page? Why not write one yourself? We now accept "guest</i><br>
<i>puzzlers," as you may have noticed. If you've got a good idea for a Puzzle Page, please</i><br>
<i>send it to us at AppleLink DEVELOP.</i><br>

<b>SAVED BY THE PUZZLE PAGE</b><br>
I've enjoyed reading <i>develop </i> since the first issue was published.&nbsp;&nbsp;I find that the<br>
articles contain a lot of useful technical information.
</p>
<p>
Normally I try to read each issue when it arrives, but when Issue 16 arrived, it sat<br>
for two months while I was finishing a product. About two weeks after the application<br>
shipped, a bug was reported where the application would randomly crash with a<br>
trashed stack on the PowerBook 180c. We spent a very frustrating Friday trying to<br>
reproduce and isolate the bug, but the behavior was inconsistent.
</p>
<p>
Over the weekend, in an effort to catch up on my reading, I picked up <i> develop </i> Issue 16<br>
and read through it. About&nbsp;&nbsp;an hour after I finished, I thought back on KON &amp; BAL's<br>
Puzzle Page, picked the magazine up again, and reread it. Something struck me about<br>
the problem they were puzzling over. Their result sounded similar to the problem we<br>
were encountering.
</p>
<p>
On Monday, we ran a series of tests in which we were able to prove that the bug was in<br>
Sound Manager 2.0 and disappeared under Sound Manager 3.0. If it hadn't been for the<br>
timely coincidence of reading <i>develop </i> and seeing a different manifestation of our bug<br>
described, we might have spent a lot longer tracking down the problem. <i> develop </i> saved<br>
us a lot of time and frustration.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the magazine.
