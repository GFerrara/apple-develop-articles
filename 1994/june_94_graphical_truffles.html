<p>
By now, many of you have installed one of the beta versions of QuickDraw GX onto your<br>
Macintosh -- and possibly by the time you read this, QuickDraw GX Software<br>
Developer's Kit version 1.0 will be available from APDA. Maybe you've played with<br>
the various sample applications and are now ready to work on your first QuickDraw GX<br>
application. Perhaps you've even read my article in<i>develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 15, "Getting Started<br>
With QuickDraw GX." In this column, I'll talk about something I referred to briefly in<br>
that article: the two versions of QuickDraw GX's combined graphics and layout<br>
portions, and how to take advantage of the debugging version during the development of<br>
your QuickDraw GX-based application. Along the way I'll update you on a few changes<br>
since I wrote the article.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE EXTENSIONS OF QUICKDRAW GX</b><br>
The QuickDraw GX system extension comes in two flavors: a nondebugging and a<br>
debugging version. When you run the QuickDraw GX installer script, the nondebugging<br>
version is installed, including the complete QuickDraw GX system. The nondebugging<br>
version is lean and mean, so it's significantly faster than the debugging version; it<br>
performs quite a bit less error checking than the debugging version.
</p>
<p>
The debugging version of the extension provides extensive error checking and other<br>
debugging amenities. When developing a QuickDraw GX application, you should use this<br>
version to shake out&nbsp;&nbsp;the bugs. The debugging extension is in the DEBUG Init folder and<br>
is named "GXGraphics (debug)" in version 1.0 (it used to be named<br>
aSecretGraphics.debug);&nbsp;&nbsp;just drag it into your System Folder and reboot. As your<br>
system starts up you'll see the debugging extension's icon displayed before the<br>
QuickDraw GX icon.
</p>
<p>
An explanation of what's really going on here may help clarify things (and it has<br>
changed): There are actually three extensions within the QuickDraw GX extension --<br>
one for graphics and layout, one for printing, and one for the Finder printing<br>
extension. The QuickDraw GX extension knows, if "GXGraphics (debug)" has already<br>
loaded, to use that extension instead of the nondebugging version of the graphics and<br>
layout extension. (Note that since the debugging extension must load before the<br>
nondebugging version, you should not change the debugging extension's name.)
</p>
<p>
<b>THE ADVANTAGES OF THE DEBUGGING VERSION&nbsp;&nbsp;DURING DEVELOPMENT</b><br>
Let's look at some differences between the two extensions, and specifically how to take<br>
advantage of the debugging version during the development of your QuickDraw GX<br>
application.
</p>
<p>
<b>Notices, warnings, and errors. </b>With the debugging version of the extension, you<br>
can get three types of information about drawing problems: notices, warnings, and<br>
errors. For a complete list of these, look at the graphics errors.h interface file. The<br>
many notices, warnings, and errors defined between #<b>ifdef debugging</b> and #<b>endif</b><br>
in that file are available only with the debugging version. You'll need to #define<br>
<b>debugging</b> in your application to take advantage of them. (Make sure <b>debugging</b> is<br>
not defined when you build your final version.)
</p>
<p>
With the nondebugging version, notices aren't available at all, and the list of errors<br>
and warnings you need to respond to in your application consists only of those<br>
relatively few that lie outside #<b>ifdef debugging</b> and <b>#endif </b>in the graphics<br>
errors.h file. Your application must be set up to handle these errors and warnings,<br>
which in general indicate that the QuickDraw GX system could not honor your<br>
application's request. For example:
</p>
<pre>shape_is_nil
size_of_path_exceeds_implementation_limit
picture_index_out_of_range</pre>
<p>
The debugging version checks for errors that you're likely to run into while<br>
developing your application, such as passing a negative pen size to GXSetShapePen or a<br>
curve to GXGetGlyphMetrics. The nondebugging version doesn't check for these types of<br>
errors; it assumes you've already shaken them out of the code.
</p>
<p>
<b>Validation routines.</b> The GXSetValidation and GXValidateShape routines are<br>
available only in the debugging version. These routines allow your application to tell<br>
whether it's passing valid parameters into a QuickDraw GX function, to validate the<br>
contents of all QuickDraw GX objects (such as a shape, style, and ink) before their<br>
use, and to validate the QuickDraw GX memory your application is using. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Speed optimizations.</b> The nondebugging version has optimizations for speed built in<br>
-- not only fewer error checks but also inline functions. The debugging version<br>
doesn't optimize for speed. This shouldn't have any impact on your application<br>
development except that there's not a one-to-one correspondence between stack crawls<br>
using the debugging and nondebugging versions. A performance analysis of your<br>
QuickDraw GX application should only be done<i>without</i> the "GXGraphics (debug)" file in<br>
your Extensions folder.
</p>
<p>
<b>GraphicsBug. </b>The GraphicsBug debugging tool allows you to explore the contents of<br>
any QuickDraw GX object to make sure it contains the correct information. Another<br>
change from before is that GraphicsBug is available in both the debugging and<br>
nondebugging versions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability to spy on an object's contents is important to<br>
your application development because otherwise you could only access information in<br>
objects by making API calls, which would be very tedious during debugging. 
</p>
<p>
There's a slight advantage when using GraphicsBug with the debugging version: heaps<br>
are listed by name rather than by hex address in the Heaps menu.
</p>
<p>
<b>Memory. </b>The debugging version's memory blocks in the QuickDraw GX heap are a bit<br>
bigger to help detect errors when your application writes over the end of a block: all<br>
the blocks end with the same signature, 'grfx'.
</p>
<p>
<b>Special MacsBug messages. </b>The debugging version generates MacsBug messages<br>
that are intended solely for the consumption of the Apple engineers in unusual<br>
circumstances. (One of my favorites is "Curious if this ever happens.") If we did our<br>
jobs right, you should never see one of these messages. In case you do, however, we're<br>
really interested in hearing what caused you to receive it; please let us know at<br>
AppleLink APPLE.BUGS.
</p>
<p>
<b>CLEANING UP</b><br>
You should design your application to take advantage of the extensive capabilities of the<br>
debugging extension, but turn those capabilities off when you create your final<br>
shipping application, to improve its performance. For example, calling<br>
GXValidateShape with the nondebugging extension installed will only result in a jump<br>
and return (that is, it will be a no-op). This is a wonderful method for testing the<br>
QuickDraw GX dispatcher, but it doesn't help the performance of your application.
</p>
<p>
In the final compile of your shipping application, you'll most likely want to remove all<br>
calls to validation routines, posting of notices, and extra warnings and errors<br>
available only in the debugging version. One approach would be to have various<br>
compilation flags associated with pairs of #<b>ifdef</b> and #<b>endif</b> to turn these features on<br>
and off.
</p>

For more information, see my article in Issue 15 if you haven't already -- or just dig<br>
into the QuickDraw GX documentation. Enjoy your journey into the QuickDraw GX<br>
world!

<b>PETE ("LUKE") ALEXANDER </b>has been providing developer support for QuickDraw<br>
GX ever since it was way up in the air. He's happy it's making its final approach, and<br>
he's hoping it lands smack dab in the middle of your software. As a glider pilot, Luke<br>
knows how important control is -- and with QuickDraw GX, you'll be able to maneuver<br>
your software into spaces you never thought possible. Since QuickDraw GX can help<br>
you do lots of great graphics stunts that you used to have to ask him about, Luke is<br>
about to soar off into the wild blue yonder and do some stunts of his own. Soon he'll be<br>
ready for the preflight check that will launch his sabbatical faster than QuickDraw GX<br>
handles two-byte text.&nbsp;&nbsp;For many weeks he'll be thinking about nothing but white sand<br>
beaches, white puffy clouds, and white-capped mountains. He'll&nbsp;&nbsp;lie on his back and<br>
watch the sway of the trees until they stop reminding him of the swashes of L's. So if<br>
you see him somewhere in Montana, Utah, Nevada, California, or Idaho, be sure to say<br>
hello -- but try not to use any words that have a G and an X in them. *
