<i>&nbsp;See if you can solve this programming puzzle, presented in the form of a</i><br>
<i>dialogbetween Konstantin Othmer (KON) and Bruce Leak (BAL).&nbsp;&nbsp;The dialog gives</i><br>
<i>cluesto help you. Keep guessing until you're done; your score is the number to the left</i><br>
<i>ofthe clue that gave you the correct answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;These problems are supposed to be tough.</i><br>
<i>If you don't get a high score, at least you'll learn interesting Macintosh trivia.</i>
</p>
<p>
KON: I have a Macintosh IIfx at home with a 13-inch color monitor and an old Kong.
</p>
<p>
BAL You mean the black-and-white two-page display? That thing is out of production.<br>
Programmers were the only ones who bought it, and we already sold one to every<br>
Macintosh programmer. I've got one too.
</p>
<p>
KON Mine's probably older, though. Fung gave me one of the prototype units that were<br>
blocking the entrance to his office about five years ago.
</p>
<p>
BAL Does it have the stylish metal cheese grater cage around it or did you actually get a<br>
plastic case?
</p>
<p>
KON I scored one with plastic, though it's yellow now from sitting in the sun. Anyway,<br>
now that the PowerPC workload is finally winding down, I've actually spent some time<br>
at home. I started playing around with Darryl's mapping program on my fx.
</p>
<p>
BAL MacAtlas?
</p>
<p>
KON Yeah. It's pretty cool. The problem is I can't open files.
</p>
<p>
BAL Command-O open? What happens?
</p>
<p>
KON Nothing. No Standard File, no dancing bears -- it's as if I never gave the Open<br>
command.
</p>
<p>
BAL I've never had a problem with that program. Does the menu get highlighted?
</p>
<p>
KON Yeah. Every once in a while you'll see it flash. This problem happens systemwide;<br>
I can't even open files in ResEdit.
</p>
<p>
BAL Can you drag documents onto the application icon in the Finder to open them?
</p>
<p>
KON Yeah. Everything not related to Standard File seems to work fine. I can edit files,<br>
play movies -- even file sharing works.
</p>
<p>
BAL What version of the system are you running? Does printing work?
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;100</b> KON I'm running System 7.1. I can't save and then print as recommended by our<br>
print shop because there's a problem with Standard File, but other than that it works<br>
fine. Why?
</p>
<p>
BAL This one's easy, KON. Something is locked down in your MultiFinder heap, so your<br>
system heap can't grow. Standard File can't bring in all its resources, so it punts. Are<br>
you running that skanky StockItToMe server that Timo and Rubinowitz wrote?
</p>
<p>
<b>90</b> KON This happens just after boot and I've got mounds of RAM now that I've removed<br>
DAL. I do a heap dump (<b>hd</b>) of the MultiFinder heap and there are no locked blocks at<br>
the bottom, so the system heap can grow all it wants. Furthermore, the heap total (<b>ht</b>)<br>
command shows that there's plenty of room in the system heap.
</p>
<p>
BAL Clearly this bug is limited to your home machine. I figure you have some slimy<br>
KON code on there that's only half debugged -- maybe a beta version of WonderPrint.<br>
Set an ATB on Standard File, 'PACK' 3, and then try to open a document.
</p>
<p>
<b>80</b> KON I hit the A-trap, but when I trace over it it just returns without putting up<br>
the Standard File dialog.
</p>
<p>
BAL Is the package getting loaded?
</p>
<p>
<b>70</b> KON Yeah.
</p>
<p>
BAL Since I don't have the source to Standard File handy, I'll use the log command and<br>
then the conditional step command to get a trace of all the instructions executed inside<br>
the package. I figure it should be fairly easy to spot some error condition where the<br>
code decides to bail. Since the _Pack3 instruction is two bytes, if the call to it is at the<br>
current PC address, I use the MacsBug commands
</p>
<pre>log MyStdFileLog
s pc=pc+2</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;to step, logging each instruction to a file and then stopping as soon as the trap is<br>
exited.
</p>
<p>
<b>60</b> KON Wow, that conditional stepping is pretty cool. I didn't know MacsBug was that<br>
sophisticated. You could have just put a breakpoint on the other side of the _Pack3 and<br>
stepped a zillion instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, the trace isn't prohibitively long. Standard<br>
File preloads all the resources it needs to display the dialog, checking each one to see if<br>
it was loaded properly. When it tries to load LDEF -4000, it fails and bails.
</p>
<p>
BAL All the resources it needs must come from the System file. Check to see if LDEF -<br>
4000 exists in the system.
</p>
<p>
<b>55</b> KON According to ResEdit, the LDEF isn't present in the System file.
</p>
<p>
BAL Compare the LDEFs in your system with a fresh installation.
</p>
<p>
<b>50</b> KON The LDEFs are all the same except one, which has a different resource ID.
</p>
<p>
BAL Well, it sounds like you've got a trashed System file. Copy and paste the bad LDEF<br>
into your system and reboot.
</p>
<p>
<b>45</b> KON Everything works fine now, but if I drag-install a new system, Standard File<br>
fails. Fixing the LDEF is addressing the symptom, not the problem.
</p>
<p>
BAL You drag the good System file over and reboot, and Standard File is broken again?
</p>
<p>
KON Yep.
</p>
<p>
BAL Check the LDEF with ResEdit.
</p>
<p>
<b>40</b> KON It's renumbered again.
</p>
<p>
BAL So something is trashing the resource map during boot. What if I boot with the<br>
Shift key held down to disable extension loading?
</p>
<p>
<b>35</b> KON According to ResEdit, the resource map is still trashed.
</p>
<p>
BAL Try dumping resources of type 'LDEF' with the command <b>rd LDEF</b> at interesting<br>
times during the boot process.
</p>
<p>
<b>30</b> KON If you hold down the Control key to enter MacsBug just after it's installed, the<br>
LDEF resources are fine. If you check it again when you're in the Finder, the LDEF is<br>
bad.
</p>
<p>
BAL So I use
</p>
<pre>atb hopenresfile ';dm @(sp+2);rd LDEF;g</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;to watch extensions load during the boot process. The command breaks as each<br>
&nbsp;extension is loaded and displays the name of the extension and the current state of all<br>
&nbsp;LDEF resources. When I see the LDEF go bad, I've gone a long way toward finding<br>
&nbsp;the offending code.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
KON During the 7.1 boot process, the system patches are loaded from disk and<br>
installed.<br>
&nbsp;One of those patches opens all the font files in that crazy font folder. After all the<br>
&nbsp;patches are installed, the system extensions<br>
&nbsp;are loaded, starting with the 8*24&nbsp;&nbsp;GC card. It's loaded first so that QuickDraw is in a<br>
&nbsp;well-defined state before other system extensions go and patch out the world; once<br>
&nbsp;third parties start getting in there, it's a free-for-all.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
BAL Obviously, all the system patches need to be installed before extensions are loaded<br>
so<br>
&nbsp;that the extensions can take advantage of improvements provided by the patches.<br>
&nbsp;Haven't you ever wondered why booting takes so long?
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>25</b> KON While the font files are being opened, the resource map is fine. But just<br>
before the<br>
&nbsp;first extension is loaded, the resource map is bad.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
BAL We need to narrow down where the map is going bad. I'll look through the system<br>
&nbsp;map for the ID that's getting stepped on. First I get the size of the resource map<br>
&nbsp;handle by using
</p>
<pre>wh @@sysmaphndl</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;Then I can find the resource ID with
</p>
<pre>f @@sysmaphndl size f060</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;since F060 is hex for -4000, the resource ID that's getting smashed.
</p>
<p>
<b>20</b> KON Good try, but you find seven occurrences.
</p>
<p>
BAL So I continue until the map goes bad, and check for -4000 again. I'll find the one<br>
that's changed, reboot, and step-spy on that address.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ta-da!
</p>
<p>
<b>15</b> KON Sorry, but the resource map is a handle and it has moved on you. You can<br>
identify the one that's changed, but you can't step-spy on it since it's moving around<br>
all the time.
</p>
<p>
BAL Fine. I'll reboot in 24-bit mode, lock the handle down by setting the high bit of the<br>
resource map handle's master pointer, and step-spy on the address. Over.
</p>
<p>
<b>10</b> KON Now Standard File works fine, but file sharing is starting to act flaky.
</p>
<p>
BAL OK. So I'm going to have to brute force it. I'll break when the last&nbsp;&nbsp;font loads. I'll<br>
log the MacsBug output to a file with <b>log myLDEFFile</b> and then <b>atb ';rd LDEF;g</b> to<br>
break on all traps and dump all the LDEF resources. I'll also do an<b>atc hopenresfile</b><br>
and then an <b>atb hopenresfile</b> to clear the <b>rd LDEF;g </b>when HOpenResFile is hit.<br>
This way we'll fall into MacsBug when the first INIT is opened. Then I'll let it rip and<br>
get some lunch.
</p>
<p>
<b>5</b> KON Pretty snazzy there, BAL. Before the map goes bad you see a bunch of Slot<br>
Manager calls and control calls. The last trap that gets called before the map goes bad is<br>
a control call to the driver which seems to originate from within InitGDevice.
</p>
<p>
BAL Hmmm. We're at secondary INIT time. The driver gets called again since all the<br>
system patches are now loaded. We added this because monitors boot back to the same<br>
configuration they were in when the machine was shut down. With 32-Bit QuickDraw,<br>
the machine&nbsp;&nbsp;could have been shut down in 32-bit video mode, so the driver needs to be<br>
called a second time after the system patches (where 32-Bit QuickDraw lives) are<br>
loaded.
</p>
<p>
KON Yeah, the call that's killing the map is a call to the driver to set the bit depth. At<br>
secondary INIT time the 'scrn' resource is read to find out what the last bit depth was,<br>
and each device is called to set the depth up properly.
</p>
<p>
BAL The call must be going to the bogus Kong video card Fung gave you. What's the ROM<br>
version on that thing?
</p>
<p>
KON It's a beta ROM. When I asked Mike Puckett about it he said there was some nasty<br>
"<i>fung</i>us" in the code, and that it was fixed before final. He gave me a new video ROM,<br>
and now everything works great. Real-world users would never experience this, of<br>
course, since the problem was corrected long before the card went out.
</p>
<p>
BAL You and Van Brink should share packrat stories. You never know, some of that old<br>
equipment might become collector's items some day.
</p>
<p>
KON This problem began when I started using MacAtlas because I switched my Kong<br>
into grayscale mode. My system is a lot more stable now that those spurious writes<br>
have been fixed. Before I tracked this bug down, I was having intermittent problems.
</p>
<p>
BAL Nasty.
</p>
<p>
KON Yeah.
