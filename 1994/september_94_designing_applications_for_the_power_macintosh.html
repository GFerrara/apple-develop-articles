<p>
The Power Macintosh offers surprises both for users and for developers. Users notice<br>
that it's a fully compatible Macintosh and that native applications run blazingly fast.<br>
Developers, upon learning how the Power Macintosh differs from a 680x0-based<br>
Macintosh, discover that it's still basically a Macintosh.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Power Macintosh can<br>
offer a much richer experience than was possible with previous computers if<br>
developers break free of their old assumptions and harness the power of the machine to<br>
make software not just faster, but easier and more enjoyable to use. 
</p>
<p>
The Graphing Calculator desk accessory that ships with the Power Macintosh was<br>
designed to take advantage of the machine's power to make some challenging<br>
mathematical tasks easily accessible -- in particular, algebraic manipulation and<br>
2-D and 3-D graphing. In this column we'll share some lessons we learned when<br>
writing the Graphing Calculator. We'll speak about software design rather than<br>
programming details because we frequently discovered that our intuition and the<br>
standard approaches to many aspects of the application design were no longer<br>
appropriate. 
</p>
<p>
In general, we learned that it's time to break free of the idioms developed for the<br>
machines of 1984 and begin designing a new generation of software. <i>We're not in</i><br>
<i>Kansas anymore</i> . The lowest common denominator of hardware -- where developers<br>
usually aim in order to maintain consistency across all Macintosh models -- has<br>
changed. The target has typically been an 8 MHz 68000 processor or, for color<br>
applications, perhaps a machine twice as fast. The lowest common denominator for<br>
Apple's RISC-based line of machines is a 60 MHz PowerPC 601 processor. This change<br>
represents an enormous jump: on some floating-point operations, for example, the<br>
Power Macintosh is as much as 20,000 times faster. 
</p>
<p>
<b>In our tests, calculations </b>using the PowerPC processor's single-precision<br>
floating-point multiply-add instruction were 20,000 times faster. This means that if<br>
we had started a lengthy floating-point calculation in 1984 at the release of the<br>
Macintosh, and that calculation were still being worked on by the computer, it would<br>
take a Power Macintosh starting now just four hours to catch up.*
</p>
<p>
Even for developers targeting 680x0-based machines, a new approach to software<br>
design can dramatically improve users' experiences. The goal is to maximize use of<br>
whatever processing power is available in the design of the user interface. 
</p>
<p>
Here's a summary of the tips we'd like to pass on; we'll look at each one in more detail<br>
below. 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Tackle expensive computations when they can improve the interface. </li>
<li>Eliminate dialogs and command lines in favor of direct manipulation. </li>
<li>Drop old assumptions and idioms. Use the processing power to explore<br>
new interfaces. </li>
<li>Provide a starting point for exploration. </li>
<li>Avoid programming cleverness. Instead, assume a good compiler and write<br>
readable code. </li>
<li>Invest development time in user-centered design. </li>
<li>Learn the new rules for performance. </li>
<li>Design tiered functionality: take advantage of whatever hardware you're<br>
running on. </li>
<li>Test on real users. </li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>THE TIPS IN DETAIL</b>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b><i>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tackle expensive computations when they can improve the interface.</i></b>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We took a fresh look at how to implement the visual feedback for dragging, scrolling,<br>
and zooming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, the Macintosh has represented these with XOR animation,<br>
which gives the impression of the action without really recalculating the window<br>
contents. This is how we first implemented them in the Graphing Calculator as well;<br>
redrawing an algebraic equation or 2-D curve, not to mention a 3-D rendered surface,<br>
is computationally expensive. 
</p>
<p>
But to try to stress the processor, we tested the direct approach, and we found that the<br>
PowerPC processor could easily keep up. So now in the Calculator, when the user drags<br>
the axes, not only is the image dragged live but the exposed parts of the function are<br>
calculated and drawn as the mouse is moved. When the zoom buttons are clicked, the<br>
entire function is recomputed and redrawn several times to animate the zoom. In this<br>
way, applications can take advantage of the PowerPC processor to dramatically<br>
improve the quality of interaction in ways that are not possible on slower machines. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliminate dialogs and command lines in favor of direct manipulation.</i></b>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since there's processing power to burn in the PowerPC 601, we simplified the user<br>
interface by replacing many dialogs with direct manipulation. The Graphing<br>
Calculator doesn't have the dialogs typical of graphing programs for specifying the<br>
range and precision of a graph (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, number of points, and<br>
so on). Instead, the user controls the view of a graph through direct manipulation.</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Today's computers are fast enough to allow you to implement direct interaction for<br>
complex tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain time constants play crucial roles in human factors analysis.<br>
Recognizing these thresholds can help create a smoother interface. If a task like<br>
interacting with an equation takes under one-tenth of a second, users won't be bothered<br>
by the delay; if it takes under one-fourth of a second, it's fast enough not to be<br>
annoying. Longer delays, however, make users realize that they're waiting. With fast<br>
response times, users can ignore the computer and have fun exploring the subject at<br>
hand. 
</p>
<p>
By emphasizing direct manipulation, we reduced even algebraic simplification, a task<br>
that might seem to require a command-line interface, to the paradigm of MacDraw.<br>
Math is traditionally intimidating, and math programs even more so, but we wanted to<br>
make mathematics fun. This was really a user-interface challenge, and it required<br>
rethinking many fundamental assumptions. Usability was our primary design goal;<br>
functionality was second. We were pleased to discover that with direct manipulation,<br>
we could simplify the interface without giving up powerful functionality. 
</p>
<p>
Since direct manipulation doesn't require users to learn any new commands or<br>
concepts, the manipulations immediately become part of a user's arsenal of tools. A<br>
powerful example of this is the drag algebra facility, which strikes many people as the<br>
most intriguing feature of the Calculator. The user can select a term of an equation and<br>
drag it elsewhere in the equation, just like dragging an object in a drawing program.<br>
The Calculator performs the algebraic manipulations necessary to keep the equation<br>
consistent. This feature immediately boosts users into a realm where they can<br>
confidently and easily manipulate an equation. Just as simple calculators did with<br>
multiplication and division, it allows users who understand the essential concepts to<br>
immediately move on to more interesting problems.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Drop old assumptions and idioms. Use the processing power to</i></b><br>
<b><i>explore new interfaces.</i></b>
</p>
<p>On a Power Macintosh, you can handle hundreds or thousands of times more<br>
information than before interactively. This might allow rendered 3-D objects to<br>
become user-interface components, for example. While the Graphing Calculator<br>
flashes its buttons for the usual 8 ticks to indicate that  they've been clicked, in that<br>
time it could compute and render a 3-D surface with 1000 polygons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine what<br>
controls might look like if they really taxed the processing power of the machine. </p>
<p>
Because functions are rendered so quickly on a Power Macintosh, we made 3-D<br>
surfaces spin by default. This gives users more information about the functions right<br>
away. Furthermore, there are no menus or dialogs to control the view of surfaces; just<br>
as it does for 2-D graphs, the Calculator lets users change the 3-D view by grabbing<br>
the surface with the mouse. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide a starting point for exploration. </i></b>
</p>
<p>Applications should avoid batch setup operations, such as requiring users to set a lot of<br>
dialog options before performing an operation. Instead, provide a starting point<br>
for exploration, with reasonable defaults for whatever's necessary to get users to<br>
that point. </p>
<p>
Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the Graphing Calculator is what it doesn't ask of<br>
users. They don't have to set up any graphing options before viewing a curve or a<br>
surface; there are no preliminary dialogs or required commands for users to do this.<br>
For any equation that can be graphed, the user simply clicks a Graph button to draw it.
</p>
<p>
We've all had the bewildering experience of trying to use a program only to discover<br>
that we don't even know how to begin. One of the toughest problems is to create an<br>
interface that makes functionality available and enjoyable for first-time users. But<br>
clearly this is where the design effort offers the greatest payoff. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid programming cleverness. Instead, assume a good compiler and</i></b><br>
<b><i>write readable code.</i></b>
</p>
<p>Cycle-counting and compiler-specific optimizations are favorite pastimes of hackers,<br>
and sometimes they're important. But we could never have completed the<br>
Graphing Calculator in under six months had we worried about optimizing each<br>
routine. Rather, we dealt with speed problems only when they were perceptible to<br>
users. </p>
<p>
We made no attempt to look at performance bottlenecks or at the compiled code of the<br>
Calculator until after running execution profiles. We were surprised where the time<br>
was being spent. Most of the time that the Calculator is compute-bound it's either in<br>
the math libraries or in QuickDraw. So little time is spent in our code that even<br>
compiling it unoptimized didn't slow it down perceptibly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving our code's<br>
performance meant calling the math libraries less often. 
</p>
<p>
Programmers are often tempted to spend time saving a few bytes or cycles or to<br>
fine-tune an algorithm. If the change isn't visible to users, however, the benefits may<br>
not extend beyond the programmer's satisfaction. When most of the code in an<br>
application is straightforward and readable, maintenance and improvements are easier<br>
to make. Those are changes that users<i>will</i> notice. 
</p>
<p>
<b>To maximize drawing speed </b>without sacrificing compatibility, the Calculator<br>
renders its graphs offscreen in GWorlds and uses CopyBits to transfer them to the<br>
screen. See "Drawing in GWorlds for Speed and Versatility" in <i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 10 for a<br>
discussion of this technique.*
</p>
<p>
<b><i>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Invest development time in user-centered design. </i></b>
</p>
<p>Complex algorithms should be used not for their own sake but to improve the user<br>
experience. For example, as the user drags the pane divider in the Calculator<br>
window, the application redraws most of the window (offscreen in a GWorld) rather<br>
than recalculating exposed areas. The Power Macintosh is fast enough that it wasn't<br>
worth spending coding and debugging time to save on runtime calculation, because<br>
the savings wouldn't be perceived by the user. </p>
<p>
In contrast, when users click on a 2-D curve to read an (x,y) coordinate, some quite<br>
sophisticated processing happens. As the user moves the mouse, a numeric<br>
root-finding algorithm looks for interesting points such as maxima, minima, and<br>
zero-crossings to solve equations numerically.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, because numerical<br>
methods to find maxima and minima are imprecise, we also compute symbolic<br>
derivatives of the functions and then look for where the derivative is 0, which locates<br>
maxima and minima much more accurately. All this work goes completely unnoticed by<br>
the user. But the user does notice the result: simply clicking on the curve tells with<br>
great precision what's interesting at that point. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn the new rules for performance. </i></b>
</p>
<p>You may discover that there<i>are</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;places where performance tuning would be<br>
worthwhile in your application. The rules for performance have changed, and<br>
knowing the new rules is essential. Some programming techniques that traditionally<br>
improve performance can be counterproductive. In particular, on<br>
PowerPC-based systems, avoiding instruction cache misses is far more important<br>
than saving instructions. </p>
<p>
Getting good performance out of a fast machine doesn't always come without effort. To<br>
be able to exploit modern hardware to improve an application, you must have some<br>
understanding of the hardware and what allows it to be fast. It's extremely important<br>
to understand the processor and memory architecture of your target platform.
</p>
<p>
The memory system in the Power Macintosh is much faster than the memory system of<br>
other Macintosh models. The 64-bit bus allows for substantially improved data<br>
transfer. However, the processor is much, much faster than the memory system. An<br>
uncached memory reference may take 20 times as long as a cached memory reference.<br>
Performance will actually be slowed down dramatically by a speed<i>optimization</i> that<br>
saves floating-point multiply instructions (expensive on some processors, but not on<br>
the PowerPC) at the expense of extra memory usage that forces instructions or data<br>
out of the cache. 
</p>
<p>
Understanding patterns of memory reference is very important in analyzing<br>
algorithms for performance. Stepping through an array across cache lines can quickly<br>
flush all lines out of the cache.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cache lines are discussed in the Balance of Power<br>
column in this issue.) This can cripple attempts to walk the data structures typically<br>
maintained by interface-intensive applications. The PowerPC 601 has an eight-way<br>
set associative cache, which is fairly resilient to degradation from flushing of cache<br>
lines. However, the 603 processor has just a two-way set associative cache. Any<br>
processor-intensive calculations must avoid cache thrashing if they are to avoid<br>
degrading below an acceptable level of user responsiveness. 
</p>
<p>
<b>For additional architecture insights </b>and tuning strategies, see the Balance of<br>
Power column in <i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 18 and in this issue.*
</p>
<p>
Because no two platforms will run at the same speed, it's important to design software<br>
to work well on a variety of machines. In principle, this means that the same<br>
application could run on any Macintosh, while being far more powerful -- and more<br>
pleasant to use -- on a Power Macintosh. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Design tiered functionality: take advantage of whatever hardware</i></b><br>
<b><i>you're running on. </i></b>
</p>
<p>Just as it's frustrating for users of entry-level machines to be unable to run<br>
software, it's equally frustrating for users of fast, high-end hardware with<br>
plenty of memory to have features execute unnecessarily slowly, or to be<br>
constrained by programs that expect and only take advantage of minimal resources. </p>
<p>
The Graphing Calculator does assume a Power Macintosh as its base platform;<br>
otherwise its expectations are modest. However, its appetite is unbounded. It does all<br>
drawing using offscreen buffers in temporary memory when adequate RAM is<br>
available, but will scale back to onscreen, QuickDraw-based rendering when<br>
temporary memory is limited. System 7 makes this easy with purgeable GWorlds;<br>
once LockPixels fails, the Calculator knows that it must work within tighter<br>
constraints. Later, when it can reallocate the offscreen buffer, it does so and resumes<br>
the fast, smooth graphing effects. When memory is abundant, the Calculator uses many<br>
temporary GWorlds to buffer frames of 2-D inequality graphs calculated for varying<br>
values of<i>n</i> , such as the animation of cos<i>n</i> x &lt; 0. 
</p>
<p>
The Graphing Calculator does all 2-D graph computation in 15-tick chunks. For<br>
simple curves, this typically renders the entire curve at once. But 2-D inequalities<br>
are drawn piece by piece. Once Power Macintosh computers are fast enough that an<br>
entire, complex inequality graph can be drawn in a single 15-tick time slice, users<br>
will be able to explore inequalities as fluidly as they can now play with simple<br>
functions. 
</p>
<p>
To take advantage of faster machines, always base computational units on real time<br>
rather than on more arbitrary measures. If the Calculator had recomputed a fixed<br>
number of points and then called WaitNextEvent, too much time would have been<br>
yielded to other processes, even on graphs simple enough to be recomputed and drawn<br>
all at once. Instead, the Calculator calls TickCount and lets that dictate when it needs to<br>
yield time. This approach allows for a smooth user interface and cooperative execution<br>
regardless of the processor's speed. 
</p>
<p>
Designing tiered functionality means abandoning assumptions about what is and is not<br>
practical on the target hardware. For addressing resources, such as available<br>
hardware and memory, or when execution can be threaded or time-sliced, the options<br>
are usually clear. For matters of raw speed, the proper approach may not be so<br>
obvious. It may come down to measuring the execution speed of a particular procedure<br>
at run time and basing a decision on that. For example, an animation effect might be<br>
suitable if it takes under 8 ticks, or a routine that bypasses QuickDraw for drawing in<br>
a GWorld may be worthwhile if it really is faster than its QuickDraw alternative. 
</p>
<p>

Speed on the Power Macintosh" in <i> develop</i> Issue 18.*
</p>
<p>
<b><i>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Test on real users. </i></b>
</p>
<p>The Graphing Calculator reflects our vision of a new kind of calculator. But user<br>
testing was essential for showing us the holes in our vision. For example,<br>
elements that were directly manipulable in our eyes were overlooked by users. So<br>
we redesigned them to make their functions clearer, and then added a demo mode to<br>
point out important controls explicitly.</p>
<p>
In tests, the users who looked at the help pages invariably turned first to the page at<br>
the end offering "tips." This surprised us, but also made clear where to put the most<br>
important information for using the Calculator. 
</p>
<p>
Toward the end of the development of the Graphing Calculator, as the final user tests<br>
were being conducted, we saw students using the Calculator effectively within minutes,<br>
without instruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching a high school student say "Wow!" as an equation came<br>
to life on the screen was probably the most satisfying moment for us as programmers.<br>
It was also the one that offered us the greatest hope about the future of personal<br>
computing. The Power Macintosh offers us the chance to reach more people while<br>
making the experience more enjoyable and easier for users than ever possible on<br>
earlier generations of computers. As developers, we have a new world to explore.
