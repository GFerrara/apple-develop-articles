The success of QuickTime since its introduction in December of 1991 has been<br>
extraordinary; not only are there now countless applications and multimedia products<br>
for QuickTime on the Macintosh platform, but QuickTime has been successful for<br>
cross-platform developers as well. QuickTime for Windows, shipping since November<br>
of 1992, is becoming an important tool for Windows multimedia developers. Because<br>
movies can be created with QuickTime on the Macintosh and then used unaltered with<br>
QuickTime for Windows, developers are able to create a movie once and use it on both<br>
systems. This capability has been available since the 1.0 release of QuickTime.
</p>
<p>
To satisfy your curiosity and help you out with your own QuickTime products, this<br>
column discusses how to create movie files that are cross-platform compatible and<br>
then gives techniques for storing and accessing multiple movies in a single file (which<br>
currently poses a problem in the cross-platform environment). 
</p>
<p>
<b>CREATING CROSS PLATFORM-COMPATIBLE&nbsp;&nbsp;MOVIE FILES</b><br>
The structure you choose for your QuickTime movie files will depend in part on the<br>
platform your movies will run on. This is because the Macintosh file system is<br>
different from other file systems in that there can be up to two forks in every file: a<br>
data fork and a resource fork. The data fork is the standard file for I/O that most file<br>
systems support. The resource fork, however, is unique to the Macintosh. It's a<br>
"database" of resources that can be randomly accessed via the Resource Manager.
</p>
<p>
There are two components to a movie file: the<i>movie resource atom</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;-- a small data<br>
structure describing the movie, its tracks, and the tracks' media -- and the<i>movie data</i><br>
<i>atom,</i> containing the movie's data such as video and sound. A typical movie file on the<br>
Macintosh consists of a movie resource atom in the resource fork and a movie data<br>
atom in the data fork. Storing the movie resource atom in the resource fork with<br>
resource type 'moov' allows easy random access to the data it contains. The movie data<br>
atom is stored in the data fork as sequential data, which optimizes playback<br>
performance. 
</p>
<p>
Because file systems on other platforms don't support a resource fork, a movie that is<br>
to be used on other platforms must have its movie resource atom stored in the data<br>
fork of the movie file. This type of file is called a<i>single-fork file</i> because the movie<br>
resource atom and the movie data atom are both stored in the data fork of the movie<br>
file, and the resource fork is not used.
</p>
<p>
Movies that will be played on both Macintosh and non-Macintosh platforms can use a<br>
file in which the movie resource atom is redundantly stored in both the resource fork<br>
and the data fork of the file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movie data atom is, as always, stored only in the data<br>
fork. For lack of a better term, this type of file is also often called a single-fork file<br>
since the resource fork of the movie file can be ignored.
</p>
<p>
The simplest way to create a single-fork movie file for cross-platform compatibility<br>
is to use the Movie Converter application from the QuickTime Starter Kit (available<br>
from Apple-authorized dealers). The Save As dialog in this application has a checkbox<br>
that allows a movie to be stored in thesingle-fork format. However, the QuickTime API<br>
can easily be used to add this capability to any application. You simply call either<br>
FlattenMovie or FlattenMovieData with the flattenAddMovieToDataFork flag set. When<br>
called with this flag set, FlattenMovie places the movie resource atom in both forks,<br>
while FlattenMovieData puts it only in the data fork, leaving the resource fork<br>
untouched. 
</p>
<p>
Movie files that are created with FlattenMovie orFlattenMovieData with the<br>
flattenAddMovieToDataForkflag set are compatible with both QuickTime and QuickTime<br>
for Windows because QuickTime is able to retrieve the movie resource atom and the<br>
movie data from the data fork alone on either platform. 
</p>
<p>
<b>MULTIPLE-MOVIE FILES FOR THE MACINTOSH</b><br>
We'll return to cross-platform issues in a moment, but first let's take a look at the<br>
simple case of multiple-movie files: those that will be used only on the Macintosh<br>
platform. You can create such files in one of two ways, depending on whether you want<br>
the resulting file to be self-contained (that is, to contain all of the movie information<br>
in one file). Both of these methods have their benefits and drawbacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that<br>
will work best for you depends on your implementation and performance testing. 
</p>
<p>
To create a self-contained multiple-movie file for the Macintosh, you can use the<br>
FlattenMovie call (without the flattenAddMovieToDataFork flag set) to append an entire<br>
movie to an existing movie file. This adds the movie resource atom to the resource fork<br>
and the movie data atom to the data fork of the file.
</p>
<p>
The second method creates a multiple-movie file that's not self-contained, but instead<br>
consists entirely of movie resource atoms that reference other movie files containing<br>
the movie data atoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This technique can be useful if, for example, you're writing an<br>
interactive CD application that uses multiple movies and you want to store all the<br>
movie resource atoms in a single file that's relatively small. This file can be copied<br>
locally to a hard disk for faster access. The drawback of this approach is that you have<br>
to handle multiple files rather than have everything in one file. The excerpt below<br>
from the sample code provided on the CD demonstrates -- without error checking, for<br>
better readability -- how easy it is to add an existing movie's resource atom to a<br>
movie file. 
</p>
<pre>// Open source movie file to add.
OpenMovieFile(&amp;reply.sfFile, &amp;sourceRefNum, fsRdWrPerm);
NewMovieFromFile(&amp;theMovie, sourceRefNum, &amp;resId,
    movieName, 0, (Boolean *) 0);
CloseMovieFile(sourceRefNum);

// Write out to the collection file.
currentResFile = CurResFile();
UseResFile(collectionRefNum);
myResId = 0;
AddMovieResource(theMovie, collectionRefNum, &amp;myResId,
    movieName);
UseResFile(currentResFile);

// Clean up.
DisposeMovie(theMovie);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
AddMovieResource does more than just add the movie resource atom: it updates the data<br>
references so that the new movie will refer to the correct movie data file. 
</p>
<p>
Accessing multiple-movie files for Macintosh-only use is easy. You just use the<br>
Resource Manager to access the movie resource atoms in the resource fork of the file.<br>
The following excerpt from the sample code on the CD uses the Resource Manager to<br>
access the various movies. (The code on the CD adds the resource names of all the<br>
movies to a menu; your code can of course do whatever it wants with the movies.)
</p>
<pre>currentResFile = CurResFile();
UseResFile(theRefNum);
movieCount = Count1Resources('moov');
for (i=1; i&lt;=movieCount; i++) {
    movieResource = Get1IndResource('moov', i);
    // Do whatever you want with this movie.
    . . .
    ReleaseResource(movieResource);
}
UseResFile(currentResFile);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;CROSS-PLATFORM MULTIPLE-MOVIE FILES</b><br>
&nbsp;To create a multiple-movie file that's cross-platform compatible, you just repeatedly<br>
call FlattenMovie orFlattenMovieData with the flattenAddMovieToDataForkflag set, as<br>
described earlier under "Creating Cross Platform-Compatible Movie Files." Accessing<br>
such a file, however, is complicated. Since it's a single-fork file, you can't access the<br>
movie resource atoms randomly as with the Resource Manager. There's also a problem<br>
with accessing the atoms directly; to understand this problem, you need to know how a<br>
single-fork movie file is structured.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The movie data atom appears before the movie resource atom in a single-fork file. The<br>
first four bytes of the movie data atom contain the size of the atom. (Figure 4-2<br>
in<i>Inside Macintosh: QuickTime</i> , page 4-5, illustrates this structure.) This permits<br>
QuickTime to skip over the movie data atom to find the movie resource atom. If you<br>
place several movies in the same file, the movie data atoms are interleaved with the<br>
movie resource atoms. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Here's the problem: A bug in QuickTime through its current version (1.6.1) causes<br>
the size field in the movie data atoms to be filled in incorrectly. The illustration below<br>
shows how QuickTime currently creates a single-fork movie file in which<br>
FlattenMovieData has been called multiple times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atom size in the first movie data<br>
atom takes you to the last movie resource atom rather than the first movie resource<br>
atom. Therefore, you can locate only the last movie in the file. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/154.gif" width="353 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;This bug will be fixed in the next version of QuickTime. The solution for now is to use<br>
the wrapper function called BetterFlattenMovieData, included on this issue's CD. This<br>
function, when called multiple times, creates a single-fork file in which the size and<br>
type fields of all atoms contain the correct information.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;To locate the movies in a file with correct size and type fields, you traverse the data<br>
fork and read in those fields of each atom to determine its size and whether it's a movie<br>
resource atom. When you know the size of the atom, it's easy to skip over it and access<br>
the next atom. Of course, the last atom is reached when the end of the file is reached.<br>
The following code from the CD demonstrates how you would do this. 
</p>
<pre>// Locate the file offset of the movie resource
// atom stored at the specified index.
if (FSpOpenDF(theFile, fsRdPerm, &amp;myRefNum)   == noErr) {
    currentLoc = 0;
    doneCounter = index;
    *fileOffset = 0;
    while ((doneCounter &gt; 0)) {
          if (err = SetFPos(myRefNum, fsFromStart, currentLoc))
                 return(err);
          readLength = 8;
          if (err = FSRead(myRefNum, &amp;readLength, header))
                 return(err);
    if (header[1] == 'moov')
          doneCounter--;
    *fileOffset = currentLoc;
    currentLoc += header[0];
    }
    FSClose(myRefNum);
} else
    return (err);
return (noErr);</pre>

<b>MOVING ON</b><br>
I'm happy to see that QuickTime is being used in new and exciting ways. By taking full<br>
advantage of the cross-platform and multiple-movie capabilities of QuickTime, you<br>
can bring your products to new heights. The sample code on the CD will start you on<br>
your way. Enjoy!
