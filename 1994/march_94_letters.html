<b>FLOATING BUGS</b><br>
I liked Issue 15's article on floating windows and have successfully implemented your<br>
routines. I did, however, find one bug. Your routine HideReferencedWindow can leave<br>
the process's window list pointing to a deallocated window when there are no floating<br>
windows.<br>
-- Chester Murphy<br>
<p>
<i>Thanks for pointing this out. It's fixed -- along with some other small bugs -- in the</i><br>
<i>code on this issue's CD. (It's been fixed since Issue 16's CD.)</i><br>

<b>PRAGMATIC SOLUTION</b><br>
Floating windows is one of my favorite subjects. I tried to compile your<br>
WindowExtension example, using THINK C 6.0. My first problem was with<br>
USES68KINLINES. THINK C checks the #pragma parameter with the function<br>
declaration. So I tried to use A1 and D0 as parameters, but then I needed a few more<br>
#pragmas for the activate handlers. I still don't have a working version.
</p>
<p>
Also, could you explain why we need CallUniversalProc? I'm quite happy with the C<br>
syntax.
</p>
<p>
Thank you very much for doing such a good job on the article.
</p>

<i>The use of USES68KINLINES has changed since Issue 15 went to press. Currently,</i><br>
<i>#pragma parameters aren't&nbsp;&nbsp;used any more, so you shouldn't have any problems using</i><br>
<i>the header file with THINK C. Additionally, the new version of the floating windows</i><br>
<i>code uses the universal header files that are discussed in the "Making the Leap to</i><br>
<i>PowerPC" article in Issue 16 and are on this issue's CD. We recommend using</i><br>
<i>CallUniversalProc in your source code (or one of its specific variants, like</i><br>
<i>CallActivateHandlerProc in the floating windows code) to allow for greater portability</i><br>
<i>of your source code between platforms. For a detailed explanation of using</i><br>
<i>CallUniversalProc&nbsp;&nbsp;and UniversalProcPtrs, check out the aforementioned article in</i><br>
<i>Issue 16.</i><br>

<b>DESKTOP FILES REDUX</b><br>
I liked Issue 15's Puzzle Page, about the damaged desktop files. I've seen this bug often,<br>
since I fix a lot of damaged hard disks.&nbsp;&nbsp;You probably know this, but if the desktop files<br>
get hosed in a certain way, rebuilding them in the Finder won't fix them. You have to<br>
delete them (or rename them) to get the Finder to build new files from scratch. <br>
AutoDoubler comes with a little utility called Desktop Reset just for deleting the<br>
desktop files.<br>

<p>
<i>I didn't know this when I wrote that Puzzle Page, but you're right. When the desktop</i><br>
<i>file gets damaged to the point where the File Manager can't open it, the Finder can't</i><br>
<i>rebuild the file, so you have to throw it away or rename it. Thanks for the feedback.</i><br>
