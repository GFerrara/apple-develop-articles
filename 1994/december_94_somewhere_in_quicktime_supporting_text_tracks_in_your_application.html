<p>
<i>Text media tracks were introduced with QuickTime version 1.5 and have been further</i><br>
<i>improved in QuickTime 2.0 with the addition of calls for more powerful searching and</i><br>
<i>a new facility called burnt text. The big news is that text tracks are now supported in</i><br>
<i>QuickTime for Windows version 2.0, which makes text tracks a cross-platform</i><br>
<i>solution. If you're developing content-based products that need to be cross-platform,</i><br>
<i>you'll want to take a look at text tracks.</i>
</p>
<p>
Text tracks give you the ability to embed text in a QuickTime movie, which is<br>
particularly useful if you're aiming your product at international markets or at<br>
people with hearing impairments (you can subtitle your movie) or if you want to<br>
enable your users to perform searches (by including the script of a play or movie in a<br>
text track, for instance, you can make it easy for users to find a particular scene by<br>
searching for a key piece of dialog). The possibilities for adding value to your<br>
QuickTime application and content with text tracks are limited only by your<br>
imagination.
</p>
<p>
This column shows you how to add text track support to your QuickTime application,<br>
including support for searching and editing. The sample program QTTextSample on this<br>
issue's CD demonstrates what's involved. This small application plays a movie<br>
controller-based movie in a window and offers users the ability to search for a<br>
particular sequence of characters, or edit the text, in the text track.
</p>
<p>
Text tracks are handled by the text media handler, which is documented in the "Movie<br>
Toolbox" chapter of <i>Inside Macintosh: QuickTime. </i>The text media handler's<br>
functionality includes the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>    Searching for text, using FindNextText. With QuickTime 2.0, a new<br>
routine for text searching, MovieSearchText, can be used. This call is also<br>
available with QuickTime 2.0 for Windows.</li>
<li>    Adding plain or styled text, using AddTextSample or AddTESample. Both<br>
of these calls allow you to define additional text properties, such as scrolling<br>
and highlighting.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Searching is something that all applications that support text tracks will want to offer<br>
the user, while editing text is likely to be something that only a few specialized<br>
applications will want to provide. Editing of text can be accomplished with Movie<br>
Toolbox routines, as discussed later in this column.
</p>
<h2>FIRST THINGS FIRST</h2>
<p>
Your QuickTime application needs to do a few basic things at the outset, as<br>
QTTextSample demonstrates. These include checking for the QuickTime version<br>
number, growing your heap as large as possible, and checking return codes.
</p>
<p>
<b>QuickTime version number. </b>A Macintosh application that supports text tracks<br>
requires QuickTime version 1.5 or later; a Windows application that supports text<br>
tracks requires QuickTime 2.0 for Windows. On Macintosh platforms you can use the<br>
Gestalt selector gestaltQuickTime to check that the version number returned in the<br>
high-order word is greater than or equal to the required version (0x0150 for<br>
QuickTime 1.5; 0x0200 for QuickTime 2.0).
</p>
<p>
Our sample program bails out if the system isn't running QuickTime version 1.5 or<br>
later. If your application uses calls provided by later releases of QuickTime but you<br>
also want it to run on earlier versions, you should check for the version number and<br>
selectively enable your application's functionality accordingly.
</p>
<p>
<b>Heap size. </b>As discussed in the Somewhere in QuickTime column in<i>develop</i> Issue 13<br>
("Top 10 QuickTime Tips" by John Wang), you need to ensure that you grow your heap<br>
as large as possible in your initialization code by calling the MaxApplZone routine.<br>
QuickTime needs to use a lot of handle-based data structures, so you also need to ensure<br>
that there are enough master pointers allocated in the base of your&nbsp;&nbsp;heap. To do that,<br>
you should call MoreMasters a number of times (you can tell how many times by<br>
examining your heap while the application is running). If you don't do this, your heap<br>
may become fragmented, which in turn may cause certain QuickTime routines to fail<br>
due to lack of memory. This is a general Macintosh programming issue that you should<br>
be aware of for all applications.
</p>
<p>
<b>Return codes. </b>Finally, always check those return codes, and handle errors as<br>
required. Most QuickTime routines return a status code of type OSErr; if this isn't<br>
equal to noErr, you have problems. QuickTime is always trying to tell you something<br>
-- listen and your life will be more complete!
</p>
<h2>THE USER INTERFACE</h2>
<p>
The user interface for the sample application is pretty basic. Figure 1 shows the<br>
application window. As you can see, the text for the movie is repeated below the movie<br>
so that it can be edited. Buttons offer the user the options of finding specific text or<br>
updating the text with editing changes. (The Update Text button is dimmed unless the<br>
text in the text box has been modified.)
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/280.gif" width="240 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>With text track selected</b>

</p>
<p>
<b>With movie selected</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1. </b>The application window for QTTextSample
</p>
<p>
Because the user can potentially edit two items -- the movie's text track or the movie<br>
itself -- the application needs to keep track of what the user selected last (either text<br>
or the movie) and highlight it in some way. As shown in Figure 1, when the text track<br>
is selected in our sample application, the text below the movie has a black box around<br>
it; when the movie is selected, the movie frame has a black box around it. When the<br>
window is inactive (for example, when you switch applications), the box surrounding<br>
the active item is rendered in gray.
</p>
<h2>TRICKS FOR EASY ACCESS</h2>
<p>
In the sample code, the movie controller is stored in a record referenced by a handle<br>
stored in the window's refCon, along with a few other bits and pieces related to the<br>
movie and the text for a window. This gives us easy access to both the movie controller<br>
and its associated movie:
</p>
<pre>aDocHdl = (DocHandle)GetWRefCon(theMovieWindow);
aController = (**aDocHdl).myController;
aMovie = MCGetMovie(aController);</pre>
<p>
When we need to locate the first track of a particular type (in our case a text track) in<br>
a movie, we can use the following handy utility routine:
</p>
<pre>Track GetFirstTrackOfType (Movie aMovie,
                              OSType trackType)
{
   Track      theTrack = nil;
   OSType     mediaType;
   short      trackCount, index;
  
   trackCount = GetMovieTrackCount(aMovie);
   for (index=1; index &lt;= trackCount; index++) {
      Track t = GetMovieIndTrack(aMovie, index);
      GetMediaHandlerDescription(GetTrackMedia(t),
                  &amp;mediaType, nil, nil);
      if (mediaType == trackType) {
         theTrack = t;
         break;
      }
   }
   return theTrack;
}</pre>
<p>
A new function, GetMovieIndTrackType, was introduced with QuickTime 2.0 for both<br>
Macintosh and Windows. GetMovieIndTrackType provides an easy way to iterate<br>
through all tracks in a movie that are either of a given media type or that support a<br>
particular media characteristic. Documentation for this, and the other new QuickTime<br>
calls, can be found in the QuickTime 2.0 Developer's Kit which is available from Apple<br>
Developer Catalog
</p>
<h2>HANDLING TEXT TRACKS</h2>
<p>
By default, QuickTime displays the text for an enabled text track. We want to be able to<br>
exercise more control over the format and display of the text track and to edit the text<br>
embedded in the movie. Thus, we need to extract the text from the track and stuff it<br>
into a TextEdit record.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our application needs to be able to access the text for a particular frame as it's<br>
displayed. We do this by defining a text-handling procedure (or textProc for short)<br>
with the following format:
</p>
<pre>pascal OSErr MyTextProc (Handle thisText,
         Movie thisMovie, short *displayFlag,
         long refCon)</pre>
<p>
The text is passed in the handle. To access the text, we need to determine the length of<br>
the text and store it somewhere.
</p>
<pre>// This yields the actual size of the text.
textSize = *(short*)(*thisText);
// This yields a pointer to the text.
textSamplePtr =
            (char*)(*thisText + sizeof(short));</pre>
<p>
The style data for a text track is stored in one of two places. Information about the<br>
default text style, together with other items of interest (such as the background<br>
color), is stored in a text description handle (see page 2-291 of<i>Inside Macintosh:</i><br>
<i>QuickTime</i>). Additional information may be supplied at the end of the handle passed to<br>
the textProc, in the form of 'styl' atoms (see page 2-290 of <i>Inside Macintosh:</i><br>
<i>QuickTime</i>). Our sample code&nbsp;&nbsp;demonstrates how to access the style information. To get<br>
the text description, you need to call GetMediaSample in the textProc, as shown in<br>
Listing 1. You need to parse the handle passed into your textProc to see if additional<br>
information is supplied; the sample code illustrates how to do this.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1. </b>Getting the text description
</p>
<pre>theErr = GetMediaSample(aMedia, myData, nil, nil, mediaCurrentTime,
         nil, sampleDescriptionH, nil, nil, nil, nil);
...
if (sampleDescriptionH) {
   scrapHdl = (StScrpHandle)NewHandle(sizeof(StScrpRec));
   if (scrapHdl == nil)
      CheckError(MemError(),
         "\pCouldn't allocate memory for the style table");
   (**scrapHdl).scrpNStyles = 1;
   (**scrapHdl).scrpStyleTab[0] =
      (**((TextDescriptionHandle)sampleDescriptionH)).defaultStyle;

   // Delete the previous contents of the TextEditHandle.
   TESetSelect(0, (**myDocTEH).teLength, myDocTEH);
   TEDelete(myDocTEH);

   // Insert the new text.
   TEStylInsert(textPtr, textSize, scrapHdl, myDocTEH);

   DisposeHandle((Handle)scrapHdl);
}
else TESetText(textPtr, textSize, myDocTEH);</pre>
<p>
We can control whether QuickTime also displays the text, by returning a value in the<br>
displayFlag parameter. For example, if we want the default display, we set it in the<br>
following way:
</p>
<pre>*displayFlag = txtProcDefaultDisplay;</pre>
<p>
Other flags are available either to suppress output or to ensure that QuickTime always<br>
displays the text track, regardless of the settings saved in the movie. Check page<br>
2-364 of <i>Inside Macintosh: QuickTime</i> for more details.
</p>
<p>
In order for the textProc we've defined to get called, we need to tell QuickTime about it.<br>
This is easily accomplished with the SetMovieTextHandler routine (shown in Listing<br>
2), which uses the utility routine described earlier to get the first text track.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 2. </b>The SetMovieTextHandler routine
</p>
<pre>OSErr SetMovieTextHandler (WindowPtr aWindow)
{
   MediaHandler        aMediaHandler;
   MovieController     aController;
   Movie               aMovie;
   Track               aTrack;
   DocumentHandle      aDocHdl;

   aDocHdl = (DocumentHandle)GetWRefCon(aWindow);
   aController = (**aDocHdl).myController;
   if (aController != nil) {
      aMovie = MCGetMovie(aController);

      // If there's a text track in the movie, set the textProc.
      if (aMovie != nil &amp;&amp; (aTrack = GetFirstTrackOfType
             (aMovie, TextMediaType)) != nil) {
         aMediaHandler = GetMediaHandler(GetTrackMedia(aTrack));
         if (aMediaHandler != nil)
            SetTextProc(aMediaHandler, NewTextMediaProc(MyTextProc),
               (long)aWindow);
      }
   }
   return GetMoviesError();
}</pre>
<h2>SEARCHING FOR TEXT</h2>
<p>
One feature that should be provided in movies that have embedded text is the ability to<br>
search for words. Consider a scenario where you're providing an interactive learning<br>
experience. The video track of your QuickTime movie contains a play, and the text<br>
track contains its script. Students can search for a particular scene just by searching<br>
for a few words. If the play were Shakespeare's <i>Julius Caesar</i>, for example, searching<br>
for "Lend me your ears" would find Marc Antony's speech at Caesar's funeral.
</p>
<p>
Searching for text in a movie is a straightforward operation using QuickTime's<br>
FindNextText routine (which is described on page 2-298 of <i>Inside Macintosh:</i><br>
<i>QuickTime</i>). You can control the way this routine works by passing in the following<br>
flags:
</p>
<ul>
<li>    findTextWrapAround -- wraps the search around at the end or start of<br>
the movie and continues searching for the text</li>
<li>    findTextReverseSearch -- searches backward</li>
<li>    findTextCaseSensitive -- makes the search case sensitive</li>
</ul>
<p>
Under QuickTime 1.5 or 1.6, however, you shouldn't use all three of these flags<br>
together in the same call; if you do, a bug will cause a bus error. You can work around<br>
this by manually implementing a wrapped search. This was fixed in QuickTime 2.0.
</p>
<p>
The sample code illustrates the use of FindNextText in the<br>
DoSearchForStringInMovieWindow routine. This routine gets the movie controller and<br>
its associated movie from the movie window. We pass in the text to search for, the<br>
direction to search in, and whether to wrap the search. The sample code shows one way<br>
of doing this with a simple dialog.
</p>
<p>
The new routine MovieSearchText, which was added to the Movie Toolbox in QuickTime<br>
2.0 and in QuickTime 2.0 for Windows, also aids in searching for text in a movie. It<br>
can search any track that supports the text characteristic. (For a track to support the<br>
text characteristic, it must implement the FindNextText and HiliteTextSample calls as<br>
defined in the Movies.h file.) MovieSearchText is defined like this:
</p>
<pre>pascal OSErr MovieSearchText(Movie theMovie,
   Ptr text, long size, long searchFlags,
   Track *searchTrack, TimeValue *searchTime,
   long *searchOffset);</pre>
<p>
In this definition, theMovie is the movie to search, text is a pointer to a block of text<br>
that contains the search string, and size is the length of the search string in bytes. The<br>
other parameters are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> searchFlags is a combination of findText flags as defined for media<br>
handlers that support text and searchText flags that manage the higher-level<br>
searching operation.</li>
<li>    searchTrack is a pointer to the first track to search (or the only track,<br>
if searchTextOneTrackOnly is set in searchFlags). If the text is found,<br>
searchTrack will be updated to point to the track in which the text was found.<br>
If nil is passed in for searchTrack or if it points to nil, the search will start<br>
from the first track in the movie.</li>
<li>    searchTime is a pointer to the movie time at which to start the current<br>
search. If the text is found, searchTime will be updated to reflect the movie<br>
time at which the text was found. If nil is passed in for searchTime or if it<br>
points to -1, the current movie time will be used.</li>
<li>    searchOffset is a pointer to the offset within the text sample (as defined<br>
by searchTrack and searchTime) in which to start the search. If the text is<br>
found, searchOffset will be updated to reflect the offset into the text sample<br>
where the text was found. If nil is passed in for this parameter, an offset value<br>
of 0 will be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If MovieSearchText doesn't succeed in finding the search string because either there<br>
were no text tracks in the movie or the text simply wasn't found, an error value is<br>
returned.
</p>
<h2>EDITING TEXT</h2>
<p>
While the text media handler provides routines to add and delete text track segments, it<br>
doesn't provide routines to edit the text contained in a text track. Most applications<br>
won't need to edit text, but in case you're interested, this section looks at the Movie<br>
Toolbox routines involved.
</p>
<p>
The DoUpdateText routine in the sample code shows how the user can edit the text<br>
contained in a movie's text track. The steps involved in this process are listed below,<br>
and the code to accomplish these steps is shown in Listing 3. Note that error checking<br>
isn't included in this simplified version of the sample code; you'll find the complete<br>
code on this issue's CD.
</p>
<p>
1. Determine which text track to edit.
</p>
<p>
2. Determine the segment of the track to be edited. To do this we need to find<br>
the start time and duration of the sample we want to edit.
</p>
<p>
3. Delete the existing text using the start time and duration we've determined.
</p>
<p>
4. Add the text from the TextEdit handle into the media, using the QuickTime<br>
routine AddTESample (described on page 2-295 of <i>Inside Macintosh:</i><br>
<i>QuickTime</i>). Then call the InsertMediaIntoTrack routine to insert the media we<br>
just created into the track.
</p>
<p>
Like all movie editing operations, editing text will cause the movie to become<br>
fragmented. You should ensure that the final production version of your movie is<br>
flattened; this will remove any fragmentation introduced by editing.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 3. </b>The DoUpdateText routine, simplified version
</p>
<pre>// Step 1:

// Get the text track; remember to check that it's not nil.
aTrack = GetFirstTrackOfType(aMovie, TextMediaType);
...

// Step 2:

// Get the media time of the current sample.
mediaCurrentTime = TrackTimeToMediaTime(currentTime, aTrack);
...
// Get detailed information on start and duration of the current
// sample (this is used later).
MediaTimeToSampleNum(aMedia, mediaCurrentTime, &amp;mediaSampleIndex,
   &amp;mediaSampleStartTime, &amp;mediaSampleDuration);
...
// Look back and find where this text starts.
theErr = GetTrackNextInterestingTime(aTrack,
         nextTimeMediaSample | nextTimeEdgeOK, currentTime,
         -kFix1, &amp;interestingTime, nil);

currentTime = interestingTime;

// Determine the duration of this sample.
theErr = GetTrackNextInterestingTime(aTrack,
         nextTimeMediaSample | nextTimeEdgeOK, currentTime,
         kFix1, &amp;interestingTime, &amp;theDuration);
...

// Step 3:

// Tell the media that we're about to edit stuff.
theErr = BeginMediaEdits(aMedia);
...
// Delete whatever was there before.
theErr = DeleteTrackSegment(aTrack, interestingTime, theDuration);
...

// Step 4:

// Write out the new data to the media.
theErr = AddTESample(aMediaHandler, aTEH,
         (RGBColor *)&amp;theTextColor, teFlushDefault, nil,
         dfClipToTextBox, 0, 0, 0, nil, mediaSampleDuration,
         &amp;sampleTime);
...
// Insert the new media into the track.
theErr = InsertMediaIntoTrack(aTrack, interestingTime, sampleTime,
    mediaSampleDuration, kFix1);
...
theErr = EndMediaEdits(aMedia);
...</pre>
<h2>NEW IN QUICKTIME 2.0: BURNT TEXT</h2>
<p>
QuickTime 1.6 introduced the capability for applications to apply special effects to the<br>
text in text tracks, notably antialiased text and drop shadows. Antialiased text is<br>
generally easier to read and looks more attractive than fonts rendered in the normal<br>
manner. However, antialiasing text takes time, and the performance penalty that's<br>
incurred playing movies with antialiased text tracks limits their usefulness.
</p>
<p>
QuickTime 2.0 allows applications to prerender text tracks, with a new facility called<br>
<i>burnt text.</i> Burnt text not only incurs less of a performance penalty than antialiased<br>
text but also has the advantage that a font doesn't need to be installed on the target<br>
machine in order to be rendered correctly. Applications that want to take advantage of<br>
this facility need to write data to the movie file in the form of a number of new atoms;<br>
for information on these additional atoms, see the file Text Imaging in QuickTime 2.0,<br>
accompanying this column on the CD.
</p>
<h2>THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT</h2>
<p>
Adding text track support to QuickTime applications really makes sense. With just a<br>
few lines of code, you can add a great deal of functionality. Most applications that use<br>
text tracks won't need to support editing the text, but it's a good idea to support<br>
searching because it provides an easy and powerful way of indexing into a movie<br>
containing text tracks.
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the sample code on the CD. It will help you get started with adding basic<br>
searching to your applications and (if required) with more advanced text track<br>
features, such as editing. Have fun!
