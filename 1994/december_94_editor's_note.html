<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>

<p>
At the Worldwide Developers Conference in May, hundreds of developers volunteered<br>
comments on <i>develop</i> , the Developer CD, and related products, writing them either on<br>
a big board we set up for that purpose or in a comments box in our electronic survey.<br>
The remarks were collated and handed out to the people in Apple's Developer Press<br>
group who are responsible for those products. (Our Able Assistant Meredith Best,<br>
whom you can see hard at work with other <i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;team members on page 111, typed<br>
up all those comments that were scrawled on the big board -- even the complaints<br>
about the conference food and the unique "At what elevation do deer turn into elk?")
</p>
<p>
So what results come out of this, if any? That's harder to answer. Of course it depends<br>
on the nature of the comment. The result of all the great feedback on <i> develop </i> is that<br>
I'll have the pleasure of doing this job for a while longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Thanks especially to the<br>
person who wrote "<i>develop </i> is brilliant! Give Caroline a raise now!"; it was hard<br>
convincing my boss I didn't enter that one myself.) The answers to some questions are<br>
really easy. For example, "How about a guest developer column?" is a no-brainer;<br>
we've always accepted columns from developers (and articles too!) and would be happy<br>
to send our author's guidelines to anyone who's interested. 
</p>
<p>
Most of the comments from the conference are in the process of being assimilated, and<br>
what they'll yield is uncertain, but we do want to thank you for sharing, as we sayin<br>
California. In turn we'll share with you some feedback that was among the strongestand<br>
that applies to many of you out there as well as to us at Apple: documentation should<i>not</i><br>
be electronic-only. (OK, a couple of developers disagreed, and one said "Ehh, who<br>
cares," but we're talking overwhelming majority here.) Paper was praised. 
</p>
<p>
But it's clear from other feedback that developers also hold up THINK Reference as a<br>
model for viewing documentation on-line. Does this contradict their praise of paper? I<br>
think not. They're recognizing the difference between reference and other types of<br>
documentation. They want paper for conceptual information but would like good (fast!)<br>
on-line access for reference materials. I for one am happy to see this distinction being<br>
made. Not only are the different types of materials too often lumped together when the<br>
big question of on-line versus off-line presentation arises, but this separation isn't<br>
being realized enough in printed books either. The first thing I polled developers on<br>
when planning NeXT's technical documentation (in a past life) was this very question,<br>
and as a result, the reference-type descriptions were placed in an entirely separate<br>
book. Read-once versus read-many -- simple. 
</p>
<p>
What I'd like to know is, if so many hundreds of you took the time to give us feedback at<br>
the conference, why don't more of you write to<i>develop</i> ? You know where to find us . . .

<b>CAROLINE ROSE </b>(AppleLink CROSE) has been writing about software ever since the<br>
Internet was the ARPAnet. She was originally hired because they wanted the fresh<br>
approach of someone new to the industry, which in those days wasn't hard to find. Now<br>
she has to leave town to find someone new to the industry. Caroline loves her job but<br>
seems to enjoy leaving town most of all. Her big trip this year was to England, where<br>
she especially enjoyed the green rolling hills and quaint old towns of the Cotswolds. She<br>
was also crazy about British desserts, particularly the banoffi pie (she lacked the<br>
courage, however, to try the Spotted Dick). *
