&nbsp;On the Macintosh, the standard file format for storing images is the PICT format.<br>
When pixel maps are stored in PICTs, the color table is always included. If you have a<br>
large number of PICTs that all use the same color table, however, it's redundant to<br>
have a separate copy of the color table in each PICT. It would be better to strip the<br>
color tables out of the PICTs themselves, store only one copy of the color table on disk,<br>
and use that color table for all the PICTs. This column describes a simple way to do<br>
that. 
</p>
<p>
<b>OF COLOR TABLES AND PICTS</b><br>
One of the really neat features of the Macintosh and QuickDraw is that the process to<br>
store a pixel image in a picture is really simple. The code can be as simple as opening a<br>
picture to start PICT recording, doing a CopyBits of a PixMap onto itself, and closing<br>
the picture; QuickDraw does the rest. 
</p>
<pre>newPict = OpenPicture(&amp;offRect);
CopyBits(srcPix, srcPix, &amp;offRect, &amp;offRect,
    srcCopy, nil);
ClosePicture();</pre>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Here I use OpenPicture </b>for simplicity, but as pointed out in <i> Inside Macintosh:</i><br>
<i>Imaging With QuickDraw</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;, you should really use OpenCPicture, especially if you want<br>
to specify a resolution other than 72 dpi. *
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;This code works great, but there's a catch: every time you do this, the whole PixMap<br>
-- including its color table -- is recorded into the picture. For a PixMap that's 8 bits<br>
deep (256 colors), the color table takes a little over 2K. This may not be that big a<br>
deal for one or two pictures, but what if you're pressing a CD with<i>thousands</i> of<br>
pictures that use the same color table? Suddenly all those embedded color tables add up<br>
to a significant chunk of space. For pictures delivered on floppy disks, space may be at<br>
even more of a premium, and those extra few kilobytes might matter. Also note that if<br>
you create PICTs with multiple calls to CopyBits, a color table is stored with<i>each</i> <br>
PixMap in the picture, making the problem even worse. 
</p>
<p>
<b>LEARNING TO SHARE</b><br>
More often than not, a series of PICT files will all use the same color table (usually<br>
the default color table). In these cases it would be much more economical if we could<br>
somehow store only one copy of the color table, and then share it among<i>all</i> the<br>
pictures. As it turns out, doing that is pretty easy. The solution has two parts: first,<br>
we need to be able to create PICTs that don't include a color table, and later we need to<br>
be able to draw those same PICTs using the appropriate color table, stored separately<br>
from the picture. 
</p>
<p>
<b>JUST SAY NIL</b><br>
The first part of the solution is easy. In a PixMap, the pmTable field contains a handle<br>
to a color table. When recording a picture, QuickDraw simply stores the color table<br>
specified by the pmTable field into the PICT. But if pmTable is nil, there's no color<br>
table to put in the picture, so its size ends up smaller. Only one extra line of code is<br>
needed to do this:
</p>
<pre>// Set PixMap color table handle to nil.
(*srcPix)-&gt;pmTable = nil;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Naturally, you'll need to save the color table handle beforehand, and afterward restore<br>
it before disposing of the PixMap, so that QuickDraw can dispose of all the pieces<br>
correctly. But even more important, you'll use the color table handle to create a 'clut'<br>
resource that you can save and that can later be used to draw the PICT with its correct<br>
colors. The sample program named CLUTLess, included on this issue's CD, contains the<br>
complete code to do this. 
</p>
<p>
In reality, QuickDraw adds more than just a nil color table handle to the picture when<br>
the code described above is executed. The reason for this is that some applications<br>
assume that PixMaps in a picture always have a color table, and they would die<br>
horrible deaths if QuickDraw didn't somehow protect them from themselves. To avoid<br>
this problem, QuickDraw stores a color table "stub" into the PICT that it recognizes as<br>
such when playing back the picture.
</p>
<p>
If you simply call DrawPicture to display the "clutless" picture you've made,<br>
QuickDraw will see the color table stub and create a color table for the picture on the<br>
fly. This color table is a color ramp between the current port's foreground color and<br>
its background color -- in most cases this means that you get a grayscale image. (If<br>
the foreground color and background color are not black and white, respectively, you'll<br>
get a "colorized" image.) Figure 1, which appears along with Figure 2 on the inside<br>
back cover of this issue of<i>develop</i> , shows an example of a once-colorful picture drawn<br>
this way.
</p>
<p>
<b>GET IT TOGETHER</b><br>
To display the image in its original colors, you need to somehow get the saved color<br>
table back into the PICT before drawing. You can do this by replacing the QuickDraw<br>
low-level routine that's called when a PixMap opcode is found in a picture. This<br>
replacement low-level routine will simply add the color table to the PixMap and then<br>
let QuickDraw continue on its merry way, doing all the real work of drawing, but with<br>
the correct color table in place. Replacing a low-level routine is a standard technique:
</p>
<pre>void SetNewBitsProc (WindowPtr aWindow, CQDProcs *theProcs)
{
    // Load structure with the standard routines.
    SetStdCProcs(theProcs);
    // Change the one we want to override.
    theProcs-&gt;bitsProc = NewQDBitsProc(AddClutProc);
    // Set our window's port to use them.
    aWindow-&gt;grafProcs = theProcs;
}</pre>
<p>
Our replacement routine first saves the contents of the PixMap's pmTable field so that<br>
it can later restore this value before returning. It then puts a handle to the<br>
appropriate color table in the pmTable field and calls StdBits to let QuickDraw do the<br>
hard work of drawing. Finally, it restores the saved pmTable value in the PixMap.<br>
(Note that to be completely bulletproof you might want this routine to check to see if<br>
the imageactually needs a color table -- that is, check to make sureit's an indexed<br>
image, not direct. In our sample code weknow this routine won't get called with a direct<br>
PixMap.)
</p>
<pre>pascal void AddClutProc (BitMap *src, Rect *srcR,
                            Rect *dstR, short mode, RgnHandle msk)
{
    CTabHandle  saveCTH;

    // Save color table handle.
    saveCTH = ((PixMapPtr) src)-&gt;pmTable;
    // Put 'clut' resource.
    ((PixMapPtr) src)-&gt;pmTable = gSharedClut;
    // Let QuickDraw do the work.
    StdBits(src, srcR, dstR, mode, msk);
    // Restore saved handle and return.
    ((PixMapPtr) src)-&gt;pmTable = saveCTH;
}</pre>
<p>
Once the new QDProcs are in place, you can simply call DrawPicture and the correct<br>
color table will be inserted on the fly. Figure 2 shows the same PICT as in Figure 1,<br>
drawn with the correct color table this time. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BUT WHAT IF . . .</b><br>
The sample code illustrates the case in which the pictures are being created from<br>
PixMaps directly and the color tables are being removed as it happens. But what if the<br>
images already exist, and they need to be "postprocessed" in order to strip out the<br>
color tables? Using techniques similar to those described above, it's not hard; see this<br>
issue's CD for an example.
</p>
<p>
Another common case might be this: you have a large number of pictures that among<br>
them share just a few color tables. To deal with this, you could use a PicComment to<br>
store a number in the PICT that will indicate which of the color tables to use for that<br>
PICT. 
</p>
<p>
<b>IS IT FOR YOU?</b><br>
These techniques are probably useful only if you plan to deliver a lot of images that all<br>
use the same color table (most likely on a CD). Stripping out the color tables may help<br>
you cram more images onto your distribution media or fit a few more images in<br>
memory, perhaps allowing for faster redraw (for example, when a sequence of<br>
pictures is being used for animation). 
</p>
<p>
Remember that the images thus created will be seen as grayscale (or colorized) images<br>
in any application that's not aware it needs to load a separate color table from a<br>
resource. But if you find yourself jumping through flaming hoops to try to cram just a<br>
few more PICTs on your disk, this may be just the trick you need.
