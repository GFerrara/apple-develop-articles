<i>Dear Tao,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Someone at work is stealing all my pens. I know it doesn't sound like a big deal, but it's</i><br>
<i>getting to the point where I'm going through dozens a week. Even more frustrating is</i><br>
<i>that I'm certain it's happening during normal business hours, not at night.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I just know the Internal Revenue Service isn't going to believe a huge deduction for</i><br>
<i>office supplies at the end of the year. What can I do?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Pound Wise But Pen Foolish</i>
</p>
<p>
Dear Pound,
</p>
<p>
You are in one of those unique positions where you can not only solve the mystery of<br>
the missing pens, but also spruce your office up a bit.
</p>
<p>
The first thing you need to do is cover your walls with blacklight posters. As a<br>
minimum you should get a tiger, a Jimi Hendrix, and a flaming dirigible. What's really<br>
great is that although interior design has taken huge leaps forward since the 60s,<br>
blacklight art has remained remarkably the same. Any investment you make now is<br>
sure to be preserved for years.
</p>
<p>
Once you've got the posters, you naturally must have a blacklight to properly show<br>
them off. I would recommend the most powerful one you can get, but you should stay<br>
away from the strobes -- although rare, there are some people who experience<br>
seizures from strobe light.
</p>
<p>
At this point the trap is set. Now all you need to do is dust your pens with ultraviolet<br>
powder (available from any burglar alarm shop). Make sure that you leave the light<br>
off for the first day or two. Then turn it back on and watch the people who come back<br>
and forth from your office. The one with the glowing yellow hands is your best suspect.
</p>
<p>
Note that if you're going to spend much time working under these lamps, you should get<br>
yourself a pair of UV goggles. It's not a bad idea to have a pair anyway; they make a<br>
great fashion accessory to spice up any wardrobe.
</p>
<p>
If things ever get a bit dull around the office, you can always set up your own security<br>
desk. Imagine the thrill you'll get saying things like "Excuse me, miss, you'll need to<br>
be stamped in order to reenterthe building." Putting up a sign that reads "No bottles,<br>
cans, knives, or tape recorders" will just add to the ambiance.
</p>
<p>
<i>Dear Tao,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Lately I've been pondering a real big question that I'm not making any headway with:</i><br>
<i>what, exactly, is it that people are trying to accomplish? Sure, all these software</i><br>
<i>companies are trying to change the world, make profits, and all of that, but why?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Puzzled</i>
</p>
<p>
Dear Puzzled,
</p>
<p>
You're asking the question that has plagued people from time immemorial. It's been<br>
phrased lots of different ways, usually by big people thinking big thoughts and wearing<br>
strange clothes, but the crux is always the same: just what is the deal?
</p>
<p>
Different religions and philosophies will give you different answers. Buddhists will<br>
tell you about enlightenment, Christians will expound on heaven, existentialists will<br>
ask "Why do you even care?" and a ten-year-old kid will point to a candy store.<br>
Unfortunately, all of these solutions look too far forward into the future, are too<br>
imbued with concepts of the human spirit, and still are not answering the basic<br>
question as it concerns computing.
</p>
<p>
I know the answer, but as part of the fraternity of philosophers, advice columnists,<br>
and magicians, I'm not supposed to release our secrets. However, I've never been<br>
comfortable with being a part of the "in" crowd, so I'll tell you the answer: it's<br>
Pac-Man.
</p>
<p>
From Day 1 people have wanted to be entertained, but for millennia this need was<br>
never truly fulfilled. Then in the 1980s Pac-Man came along and there was a brief<br>
period of bliss. Money could actually buy happiness -- assuming you had at least a<br>
quarter and a Pac-Man machine nearby.
</p>
<p>
Of course, a person can take only so much of any given kind of happiness, especially<br>
one that goes "wokka, wokka, wokka, GOINK!" People became burned out, and the<br>
search has been on ever since. That's right: this $200 billion-a-year industry, and<br>
all those government think tanks, are actually doing nothing more than searching for<br>
the next Pac-Man. Most experts agree that the next big breakthrough will be in a<br>
driving game of some type, which explains why you've been hearing so much about the<br>
digital highway lately.
</p>
<p>
<i>Dear Tao,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Believe it or not, I actually like wearing a suit to the office. I've tried the standard</i><br>
<i>jeans and T-shirt outfit, but I just don't feel comfortable in them. My problem is that</i><br>
<i>when I do dress up, my colleagues continually criticize me for it. What can I do?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Pinstriped in Pennsylvania</i>
</p>
<p>
Dear Pinstriped,
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, you're in a very difficult situation that probably isn't "curable." The<br>
ailment was discovered in the 1950s and is most commonly referred to today as the<br>
"Liberace Syndrome." The studies of the human genome seem to indicate that there's<br>
some sort of defect in the appearance gene that will make affected individuals want to<br>
start dressing flashier and flashier. It's not clear what causes it, although chronic<br>
exposure to jewelry, candelabra, or Las Vegas clearly will make the condition worse.<br>
You'll also find that your condition will become more severe with age.
</p>
<p>
The disease starts very mild. At first you'll shun sneakers. Then you'll start thinking<br>
that cotton has too rough of a feel. As things progress to the final and most outrageous<br>
stages, you'll find yourselfwanting to wear sequined capes and feather boas. Thousands<br>
of people have been afflicted by the Liberace Syndrome: Little Richard, Elvis Presley,<br>
Elton John, Madonna, James Brown, and Rip Taylor, to name a few.
</p>
<p>
So it's bad news and good news about your affliction. The good news is that it's possible<br>
to live a full, relatively happy life. The bad news is that you'll never be able to do so in<br>
the computer industry. My recommendation is to start singing every morning in the<br>
shower, find an agent, and figure out which colors best match your hair and<br>
complexion.

<b>TAO JONES </b>paid his way through college by volunteering as a subject for psychology<br>
experiments. He became obsessed with trying to figure out what the experiments he<br>
was participating in were trying to determine and then defeating them. One day he was<br>
told to go to the testing room down the hall and on the right. He went down the hall and<br>
entered a room that was completely dark. Figuring it was an experiment in sensory<br>
deprivation, he went in and sat down. Two days later, he emerged, nearly dead from<br>
dehydration. It was then that he discovered he'd gone down the hall and turnedleft only<br>
to end up in the janitor's closet. *

column. If he receives no more questions, we will put him in a job better suited to his<br>
skills: repairing Lisas and Apple IIIs. Will Tao be saved? Only if enough of you<br>
AppleLink DEVELOP with a question on office survival. *
