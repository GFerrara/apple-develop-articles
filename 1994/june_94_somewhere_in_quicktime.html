<h1>SOMEWHERE IN QUICKTIME</h1>
<h2>Basic Movie Playback Support</h2>

<p>
Adding basic QuickTime movie playback support to most applications is simple, often<br>
just one day's work. Developers who want to do this turn first to <i> Inside Macintosh:</i><br>
<i>QuickTime</i> , where it says to use a movie controller component. In <i> Inside Macintosh:</i><br>
<i>QuickTime Components,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;you find some elementary movie controller code samples,<br>
followed by a large reference section. This is usually enough to get started, but there<br>
are a few common problems. This column addresses some of them, with special<br>
attention to compatibility with future QuickTime releases. It assumes you're familiar<br>
with basic QuickTime and movie controller concepts.
</p>
<p>
<b>OPENMOVIEFILE</b><br>
All QuickTime movie files contain a movie resource, usually stored in the file's<br>
resource fork, and the actual movie data, stored in the file's data fork. To support<br>
cross-platform QuickTime movies, QuickTime's Movie Toolbox also allows the movie<br>
resource to be stored in the data fork along with the movie's data. (To learn&nbsp;&nbsp;how this<br>
is done, see John Wang's Somewhere in QuickTime column in <i> develop </i> Issue 17.) The<br>
usual sequence of calls to load a QuickTime movie from a file is: OpenMovieFile,<br>
NewMovieFromFile, CloseMovieFile.
</p>
<p>
In the common case of the movie resource stored in&nbsp;&nbsp;the resource fork, OpenMovieFile<br>
returns a file reference to the resource fork of the movie file, NewMovieFromFile<br>
loads the movie resource from that resource fork and creates a QuickTime movie, and<br>
CloseMovieFile closes the resource fork.
</p>
<p>
But if the movie was created on a computer running Microsoft Windows and QuickTime<br>
for Windows (using AdobeTM Premiere, for example), the file won't have a resource<br>
fork. Still, you can use the exact same sequence of calls. When OpenMovieFile is called,<br>
the file reference returned refers to the data fork; NewMovieFromFile loads the movie<br>
from the data fork, and CloseMovieFile closes the data fork.
</p>
<p>
Some developers don't use OpenMovieFile; they use FSpOpenResFile instead. While this<br>
works fine with movies made specifically for the Macintosh, it fails miserably<br>
otherwise. There's a sample movie with no resource fork, QuickBuck, on this issue's<br>
CD, so you can test this situation with your applications.
</p>
<p>
If you need to know whether OpenMovieFile opened the resource fork or the data fork,<br>
you can examine the file reference it returns, as follows:
</p>
<pre>pascal Boolean IsDataFork(short fileReference)
{
    FCBPBRec    anFCB;
    Str63       fName;

    anFCB.ioVRefNum = 0;
    anFCB.ioRefNum = fileReference;
    anFCB.ioFCBIndx = 0;
    fName[0] = 0;
    anFCB.ioNamePtr = (StringPtr)fName;

    if (PBGetFCBInfoSync(&amp;anFCB) != noErr)
        return false;

    return (anFCB.ioFCBFlags &amp; 0x0200) == 0;
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>NEWMOVIECONTROLLER</b><br>
When you need a user interface for playing a movie, you should use<br>
NewMovieController to create a movie controller appropriate for use with that movie.
</p>
<p>
A common mistake is to instead use the Component Manager routine<br>
FindNextComponent or OpenDefaultComponent to locate a movie controller. This finds<br>
the first movie controller in the system's list of registered components. QuickTime has<br>
always contained only one movie controller, so this worked fine. However, future<br>
versions of QuickTime will almost certainly include other movie controllers, so the<br>
first one isn't necessarily the most appropriate one.
</p>
<p>
To help track down those offending applications that don't use NewMovieController,<br>
there's a system extension on this issue's CD which contains a different movie<br>
controller. You'll also find a movie, Other Controller Movie, that <i> should</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;invoke the<br>
sample movie controller. If any other movie invokes the sample movie controller, or<br>
if Other Controller Movie invokes the standard movie controller, the application<br>
you're testing isn't using NewMovieController. This will cause undesirable results in<br>
the not-so-distant future.
</p>
<p>
<b>UPDATE EVENTS</b><br>
If you use a movie controller in the recommended way (that is, you allow all events to<br>
be filtered through MCIsPlayerEvent), it updates all areas of the window covered by<br>
the movie and the movie's controls. Usually that's all a window contains, so all update<br>
events are completely handled by the movie controller. This works so well that some<br>
developers actually forget to support update events at all.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it's not always so simple. QuickTime movies aren't always rectangular.<br>
If the movie is round and the window is rectangular (as in Figure 1), there are areas<br>
in the window that are not covered by the movie or the movie controls. Any update<br>
events in these areas are the responsibility of the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/173.gif" width="171 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1.</b> A nonrectangular movie
</p>
<p>
For applications using MCIsPlayerEvent, handling update events is easy:
</p>
<pre>BeginUpdate(theWindow);
EraseRect(&amp;theWindow-&gt;portRect);
EndUpdate(theWindow);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This sample code erases all areas of the window besides the movie and its controls.<br>
Normally, erasing the portRect of the window would erase the entire window, but<br>
MCIsPlayerEvent sets the update region to just the areas it didn't already handle.
</p>
<p>
If you don't handle update events, things are even worse than you might think. The<br>
window won't be updated correctly, but more important, the operating system will<br>
keep generating new update events. Update events have a higher priority than idle<br>
events, so the system will never generate idle events -- the movie will receive no<br>
time to play.
</p>
<p>
A sample round movie is provided on this issue's CD so that you can test your handling<br>
of update events.
</p>
<p>
<b>KEYSTROKES</b><br>
The standard movie controller provides for extensive keyboard control from the user<br>
but ignores keystrokes by default. They can be enabled with a single line of code:
</p>
<pre>MCDoAction(mc, mcActionSetKeysEnabled, (void *)true);</pre>
<p>
You might want to enable keystrokes only under certain circumstances. For example, a<br>
word processor might allow the movie controller to receive keystrokes only when a<br>
movie is selected. You can use the mcActionSetKeysEnabled action to enable and disable<br>
keystrokes as necessary. 
</p>
<p>
<b>MOUSE CLICKS</b><br>
All applications that use the standard movie controller pass mouse clicks on to the<br>
controller. But not all applications pass mouse clicks made on the movie itself. Failure<br>
to pass such clicks will cause problems with any future movie controllers that allow<br>
the user to interact directly with the contents of the movie. For example, a movie<br>
controller might allow the user to pan around the image by dragging on the movie; if<br>
mouse clicks aren't passed through, using either MCClick or MCIsPlayerEvent, this<br>
feature won't work.
</p>
<p>
<b>MOVIE CONTROLLER HELP</b><br>
The standard Apple movie controller is simple enough for most people to understand<br>
immediately, but it supports help balloons anyway (future movie controllers might be<br>
less obvious). If Balloon Help is turned on, the standard movie controller<br>
automatically displays help for its various controls, as well as for the QuickTime<br>
movie itself. You don't have to do anything at all for this to work.
</p>
<p>
A problem can arise if your application puts up its own help balloons. Since QuickTime<br>
movies are often embedded in a larger document, the help balloons may conflict. The<br>
result is that the movie controller's help balloon alternates with the application's help<br>
balloon. (Use Balloon Help with the Scrapbook desk accessory included with QuickTime<br>
to see what this looks like.)
</p>
<p>
The preferred solution is to stop the application from displaying a help balloon when<br>
the cursor is over a QuickTime movie or movie control. It's easy to tell whether a<br>
given point in a window intersects the movie:
</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<pre>Boolean PointInMovieController(MovieController
        mc, WindowPtr w, Point where)
{
    RgnHandle   rgn;
    Boolean     result = false;

    rgn = MCGetWindowRgn(mc, w);
    if (rgn != nil) {
        result = PtInRgn(where, rgn);
        DisposeRgn(rgn);
    }
    return result;
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
A second solution is to stop the movie controller from displaying its help balloons --<br>
necessary if you want to display your own help for QuickTime movies. To do this,<br>
install an action filter on the movie controller. Every action that occurs in the movie<br>
controller (play, step, update, key down, and so on) is passed through a single filter<br>
function. Through this filter, an application can gain access to all activity that occurs<br>
in the movie controller.
</p>
<p>
The MegaMovies application on this issue's CD provides a window that displays events<br>
that pass through the action filter. The action of interest is mcActionShowBalloon.<br>
When this action is sent, QuickTime is about to put up a new help balloon. One of the<br>
parameters passed to the action filter is a pointer to a Boolean. The filter can set this<br>
Boolean to false to tell the movie controller not to show a balloon. The following code<br>
fragments show how to install a simple action filter to prevent the movie controller<br>
from displaying help balloons.
</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<pre>pascal Boolean noBalloonsActionFilter
                (MovieController mc, short action,
                 void *params, long refCon)
{
    if (action == mcActionShowBalloon)
        *(Boolean *)params = false;
    return false;
}

. . .
MCSetActionFilterWithRefCon(mc,
        &amp;noBalloonsActionFilter, 0);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>CURSOR SHAPE</b><br>
Many applications change the shape of the cursor depending on what it's currently<br>
over. The standard movie controller never changes the cursor, but other movie<br>
controllers might want to. Unfortunately, many applications need to control the cursor<br>
themselves -- when a movie controller changes the cursor, these applications change<br>
it back immediately.
</p>
<p>
A simple solution is for applications to change the cursor only when it's first placed<br>
over a movie. (To determine whether a point is over the movie, use<br>
PointInMovieController.) After that, let the movie controller control the cursor until<br>
it exits the area&nbsp;&nbsp;over the movie. To give the movie controller the opportunity to<br>
change the cursor's shape, you must call either MCIsPlayerEvent or MCIdle frequently<br>
while the cursor is over the movie, even if the movie is stopped. The sample movie<br>
controller on this issue's CD changes the cursor when it's over the movie, providing an<br>
easy way to debug such a scheme.
</p>
<p>
<b>WINDOW ALIGNMENT</b><br>
A simple way to improve a QuickTime movie's playback performance is to ensure that<br>
the movie is at a good location on the screen. The exact definition of a "good location"<br>
varies, based on the screen depth and the processor. A typical good location is one<br>
where the first pixel of each scan line begins on a long-word boundary. This allows the<br>
decompressors to write data in the most efficientway. On slower machines, proper<br>
placement can provide the necessary performance improvement to deliver smooth<br>
playback.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, applications don't have to understand the details of how to find a good<br>
location. QuickTime's Image Compression Manager provides routines to position a<br>
window at these locations. When you create a window, you can use AlignWindow to<br>
move it to a good location before making it visible. If a window is to be moved,<br>
AlignScreenRect will modify the chosen location to make it a good location. When the<br>
user drags a window, call DragAlignedWindow instead of DragWindow to place the<br>
window in a good location. Examples of these calls are shown below.
</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<pre>WindowPtr   w;
Movie       m;
Rect            r;

// Code to create a properly aligned window.
w = GetNewCWindow(128, nil, (WindowPtr)-1);
m = getMovie();
GetMovieBox(m, &amp;r);
AlignWindow(w, false, &amp;r, nil);

// Code to drag a window with a movie in it and
// keep the window aligned properly.
GetMovieBox(m, &amp;r);
DragAlignedWindow(w, theEvent.where, nil, &amp;r, nil);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
These alignment routines were added in QuickTime 1.5, so make sure that QuickTime<br>
1.5 or later is installed before you call them.
</p>
<p>
<b>MOVIE CONTROLLER EDITING</b><br>
The standard movie controller supports the editing commands Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste,<br>
and Clear, but this functionality is turned off by default. To turn it on, call<br>
MCEnableEditing as follows:
</p>
<pre>MCEnableEditing(mc, true);</pre>
<p>
You can then use movie controller routines to implement editing:
</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<pre>Movie       m = nil;

switch (editMenuSelection) {
    case menuUndo:      MCUndo(mc);
                            break;
    case menuCut:       m = MCCut(mc);
                            break;
    case menuCopy:      m = MCCopy(mc);
                            break;
    case menuPaste: MCPaste(mc, nil);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Now you have to enable and disable the various menu items. You could call<br>
MCGetControllerInfo, which returns a long word of flags indicating, among other<br>
things, which Edit menu items should be enabled.With QuickTime 1.5, there's an<br>
easier way: call MCSetUpEditMenu, and the movie controller will enable and disable<br>
the items in the Edit menu for you.
</p>
<pre>MCSetUpEditMenu(mc, theEvent.modifiers, editMenuHandle);</pre>
<p>
<img src="img/174.gif" width="125 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
Standard 
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/175.gif" width="140 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
Modified
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This routine will even change the menu contents if appropriate. For example, Undo<br>
becomes Undo Paste if the last movie controller action was Paste; after Undo Paste is<br>
chosen, it becomes Redo Paste. What's more, if the user holds down modifier keys when<br>
pulling down a menu, other commands change as well. For example, holding down the<br>
Option key changes Paste to Add and Clear to Trim. (See Figure 2.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2.</b> Standard and modified Edit menus
</p>
<p>
MCSetUpEditMenu assumes the Edit menu is arranged in the standard way. If yours is<br>
nonstandard, you'll need to use MCGetMenuString to obtain the appropriate text for<br>
each standard Edit command, and then enable and disable the menu items according to<br>
the information from MCGetControllerInfo.
</p>
<p>
<b>JUST DO IT</b><br>
It's so easy to add movie playback support that it's often well worth the effort. As long<br>
as you keep these few simple things in mind, you shouldn't have any problems, even<br>
with future versions of QuickTime.
