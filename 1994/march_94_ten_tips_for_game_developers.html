in fact benefit any Macintosh application. Many of the tips are illustrated in the<br>
accompanying sample code (CopyBits ColorKarma) on this issue's CD. If you're<br>
considering writing a game for the Macintosh, or you want to improve your existing<br>
game or other application, these tips are for you. Here they are at a glance:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The Macintosh gaming market is wide open. </li>
<li>Bypass QuickDraw wisely. </li>
<li>Use CopyBits correctly. </li>
<li>Scroll graphics smoothly. </li>
<li>Don't synchronize with the VBL interrupt. </li>
<li>Use Sound Manager 3.0. </li>
<li>Learn when to use (or not use) Apple events. </li>

<p>
<b>THE TIPS IN DETAIL</b>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b><i>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Macintosh gaming market is wide open. </i></b><br>
The Macintosh has infiltrated the homes, offices, and schools of every continent on the<br>
planet, and it has matured enough to be ready for entertainment software of all sorts.<br>
Hit Macintosh games have sold over 60,000 copies, and users are clamoring for more.<br>
If you walk into a software store, though, you'll notice that there isn't a very large<br>
selection of Macintosh game and entertainment software.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is the time to take<br>
advantage of the lack of competition and get into the entertainment market with your<br>
games. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bypass QuickDraw wisely. </i></b><br>
Applications that bypass QuickDraw by accessing video memory directly may not work<br>
on future Macintosh platforms. The Macintosh is evolving, and some of the changes may<br>
be in the bus architecture, causing applications that write to video memory to break.<br>
We're not saying this is going to happen any time soon, but it's a good idea to be ready<br>
for it now so that your product will last in the marketplace.
</p>
<p>
A good compromise is to draw with custom drawing code into an off-screen GWorld, and<br>
then use CopyBits to transfer it to the screen. This avoids accessing hardware directly,<br>
and will always work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you must write directly to the screen, it's important to<br>
follow the guidelines set forth in "Graphical Truffles: Writing Directly to the Screen"<br>
in<i>develop</i> Issue 11, which states that you should always have a QuickDraw version of<br>
your code. If your program uses QuickDraw (or QuickDraw GX), it will always be<br>
compatible with every future Macintosh platform. 
</p>
<p>
If you do bypass QuickDraw, your application should time the custom drawing code<br>
versus QuickDraw at run time, and then choose the fastest routines. This way, the<br>
fastest code will be used in cases where your code is running on a system that has an<br>
accelerated version of QuickDraw, or perhaps a different CPU altogether. 
</p>
<p><b><i>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Use CopyBits correctly. </i></b><br>
I've heard many developers say that CopyBits is slow, that it can't achieve the frame<br>
rates needed to do good games. If you use CopyBits correctly, however, you<i>can</i><br>
achieve a high animation frame rate. </p>
<p>
Understanding all of the factors that affect CopyBits performance is critical to<br>
achieving high animation frame rates and still having processor bandwidth left over<br>
for the rest of the game. The following tips on CopyBits speed have been collated from<br>
many different sources, including Technical Notes, sample code, and other tomes of<br>
QuickDraw knowledge. (See also tip 4 below.)
</p>
<ul>
<li>CopyBits is more efficient with wider images than with tall ones. </li>
<li>CopyBits is more efficient with rectangular transfers, with no mask<br>
region. </li>
<li>CopyBits is more efficient when the source and destination have the same<br>
color table, and even better when the ctSeeds of the color tables are the same.<br>
(The accompanying sample code shows how to use the Palette Manager and how<br>
to set up the color tables in your application window and off-screen GWorld.)</li>
<li>CopyBits with a mask region is faster than either CopyMask or<br>
CopyDeepMask. Convert your masks to QuickDraw regions and then use<br>
CopyBits. (See the CopyBits vs. CopyMask snippet on this issue's CD.)</li>
<li>CopyBits is faster when the transfer source and destination are long-word<br>
aligned, especially on an 68040-based Macintosh.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For more details on these principles, see the Tech Note "Of Time and Space and<br>
_CopyBits."
</p>
<p><b><i>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scroll graphics smoothly. </i></b><br>
This tip applies to games with scrolling maps, painting programs, and any application<br>
that needs to scroll window content quickly and smoothly. </p>
<p>
Many Macintosh applications suffer from flickering scrolling, caused by erasing the<br>
previous image before drawing the new image. To reduce flicker, you should redraw<br>
only the parts of the screen that change; don't erase anything first, unless absolutely<br>
necessary. When you're designing your scrolling code or animation engine, the<br>
philosophy to adopt is that every pixel should be touched only<i>once</i> . 
</p>
<p>
Another technique is to buffer your graphics into an off-screen GWorld: make all<br>
changes in the GWorld and then transfer the image to the screen with CopyBits. This<br>
can be slower, because the image is drawn twice, but it results in an especially smooth<br>
update. An example of a game that uses CopyBits in this way is MacPlay's Out of This<br>
World. This game draws into an off-screen GWorld using custom polygon-rendering<br>
code (thus ensuring a high frame rate); then, when the image is completely rendered,<br>
it's transferred to the screen with CopyBits (ensuring compatibility with future video<br>
hardware). For more on this subject, see "Graphical Truffles: Animation at a Glance"<br>
in<i>develop</i> Issue 12 and "Drawing in GWorlds for Speed and Versatility" in Issue 10. 
</p>
<p>
There's another method that isn't as smooth but uses less memory, and that is to use<br>
ScrollRect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ScrollRect was changed in System 7: if you pass nil for the updateRgn<br>
parameter of ScrollRect, it won't erase the area that has been uncovered, and you can<br>
then use CopyBits in a second step to copy in the new bits. (In System 6, ScrollRect<br>
will erase the area you're scrolling out of, causing the screen to flicker more.)The<br>
sample code demonstrates these techniques, showing the tradeoffs between memory<br>
footprint and smoothness/apparent speed. 
</p>
<p><b><i>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't synchronize with the VBL interrupt. </i></b><br>
Many developers have wanted to synchronize animation with the vertical blanking<br>
(VBL) interrupt to eliminate tears when the next frame of animation is drawn before<br>
the display hardware has completed the previous frame. It's possible to<br>
eliminate tears from small-sized animations, but the overall application will run<br>
more slowly because you'll be spending time waiting for the VBL period to start.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
This results in a much lower animation frame rate, and the application also loses<br>
processing power for the rest of the program. Note that QuickTime does not<br>
synchronize with the VBL interrupt. </p>
<p>
Another headache to consider with respect to synchronizing with the VBL interrupt is<br>
that displays have different refresh rates, and each one's actual VBL period has a<br>
different length. This means that for your program to have accurate frame rates on<br>
different monitors, you'll have to time the refresh rate of the display you're animating<br>
on. 
</p>
<p>
To work around not being able to synchronize with the VBL interrupt, you should try<br>
to interleave the animation processing so that you're never updating too many objects<br>
at one time. The Time Manager will allow you to break the processing up into separate<br>
tasks (see tip 8). If you're getting tears on objects, consider using fewer objects or<br>
smaller ones.
</p>
<p><b><i>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Use Sound Manager 3.0. </i></b><br>
The Macintosh Sound Manager has recently been enhanced (version 3.0). It now can<br>
efficiently handle as many sound channels as memory and processor bandwidth can<br>
take. This means four channels on a Macintosh LC (which used to handle only one<br>
channel) and up to 16 or more on higher-end platforms. As a result, your<br>
application can play sound and still have enough CPU bandwidth for other<br>
animation and processing. The sample code demonstrates multiple sound channels<br>
playing asynchronously while animating an image. Also see "Somewhere in<br>
QuickTime: What's New With Sound Manager 3.0" in<i> develop</i> Issue 16 and "The<br>
Asynchronous Sound Helper" in Issue 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many bugs have been fixed in Sound<br>
Manager 3.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can now open a sound channel at the start of your program and<br>
then continuously use SndPlay to play sounds through it, without disposing of the<br>
channel between sounds. Previous versions of the Sound Manager had problems<br>
playing sampled sounds like this, so many developers adopted the technique of<br>
allocating and disposing of a new sound channel for each sound played. </p>
<p>
On the AV Macintosh models, the Sound Manager uses the DSP. This requires the DSP<br>
Manager to load a new component every time you open a new channel, and may require<br>
disk access. So if you're running with Sound Manager 3.0 you should<i>not</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;open and close<br>
a sound channel for each sound played; doing so will cause your application to perform<br>
less than optimally, especially on the AV models.
</p>
<p>
See the source code file GameSounds.c, which is part of the CopyBits ColorKarma<br>
sample, for an example of a unit that manages asynchronous sound. If Sound Manager<br>
3.0 or later is present, the code opens the sound channels at initialization and closes<br>
them when the program quits; otherwise it opens and closes the channels as sounds are<br>
played. 
</p>
<p>
Sound Manager 3.0 also adds a new routine, named GetSndHeaderOffset, that makes it<br>
easier to use a bufferCmd to play sounds. Using a bufferCmd is faster than using<br>
SndPlay. See the sample code on the CD for an example. 
</p>
<p>
Note that the sample code doesn't store the application's A5 register as part of the<br>
callback command, so that the interrupt code can set the flag associated with the<br>
channel. Instead it just stores a pointer to the flag. This allows the interrupt-time<br>
callback to be very small, since it doesn't have to save, set up, and restore A5; it just<br>
dereferences the pointer and sets the flag directly. The sample code gives an example of<br>
playing a sound asynchronously with a completion callback. I use thistechnique in just<br>
about any interrupt-time callback code I write, including VBL tasks, Time Manager<br>
tasks, and Device Manager completion routines. 
</p>
<p>
If you don't use the Sound Manager at all, you're taking an unnecessary compatibility<br>
risk. Apple has always recommended against accessing the sound hardware directly.<br>
Applications that violate this rule have broken in the past, and they will break again. 
</p>
<p><b><i>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn when to use (or not use) Apple events. </i></b><br>
Apple events have simplified interapplication communication, making it easy to add<br>
value to your application. A game played against live human players is often<br>
more fun than a game played against a computer. Just about every night you'll find<br>
some Apple engineers huddled over their computers playing Bolo, Spaceward Ho!,<br>
or other network games. </p>
<p>
Consider Velocity's Spectre, a network tank game that has been very successful.<br>
Spectre doesn't use Apple events; it uses custom DDP (datagram delivery protocol)<br>
socket listeners at the lowest level of AppleTalk to achieve high performance. But if<br>
your game doesn't require the same level of performance, you may benefit from the<br>
ease of use of Apple events. 
</p>
<p>
If you require more performance than Apple events can provide, one option is to use<br>
the PPC Toolbox directly, which will allow you to still remain a step removed from<br>
direct AppleTalk. See the PPC Toolbox chapter of<i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume VI for more<br>
information. 
</p>
<p>
If you require even more performance, you can use AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol<br>
(ADSP) directly, or one of the other AppleTalk protocols. ADSP is a higher-level<br>
protocol that will allow you to do block transfers and not worry about losing packets<br>
and packet order.
</p>
<p>
It's hard to determine which networking protocol to use ahead of time. From my<br>
experience in using Apple events to synchronize animation and events between two<br>
Macintosh computers, I would say that if your game is a more than two-player,<br>
real-time arcade game, Apple events would probably not be the best solution. If your<br>
game is a turn-based strategy-type game, like Spaceward Ho!, RoboSport, Strategic<br>
Conquest, and many others, Apple events will work very well for you, no matter how<br>
many players are in the game. 
</p>
<p>
For a simple example of using Apple events as a game messaging system, see ZAM<br>
1.a13 on the CD. 
</p>
<p><b><i>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Time Manager. </i></b><br>
The Macintosh Time Manager is very useful for game developers. Animation code often<br>
needs a heartbeat, to synchronize the timing and updates of every object.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>
Time Manager lets you break down your code into discrete tasks that run at a steady<br>
rate. This allows you to write modular code that updates smoothly.</p>
<p>
One limitation of the Time Manager is that tasks fire at interrupt time, so they can't do<br>
much more than set a flag to inform the regular event loop that it's time to do<br>
something. The sample code on the CD shows how to place a wrapper around the Time<br>
Manager that allows you to execute tasks at non-interrupt time. 
</p>
<p><b><i>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Memory Manager effectively. </i></b><br>
The Macintosh Memory Manager is very flexible, and a boon to most application<br>
programmers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the game programmer it can be a performance<br>
problem unless it's used wisely. In a game, you should preallocate as much of<br>
your memory as possible. If you're using a dynamic object allocation scheme,<br>
you should design one that preallocates the objects and keeps track of which ones<br>
are in use or not. If you have many allocated blocks in a heap and then request a<br>
new one, you could send the Memory Manager into thrashing mode where it will try to<br>
move many blocks around to make space. This can cause your animation to be<br>
jerky or your whole game to freeze for an instant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the best thing to do when<br>
performance matters is to minimize your use of the Memory Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp; To minimize<br>
Memory Manager use, you should not only allocate as much of your memory up front<br>
as possible but also avoid using relocatable blocks unless absolutely necessary.<br>
This means avoiding game architectures that rely on the Memory Manager for<br>
dynamic object allocation. Definitely allocate your nonrelocatable blocks first,<br>
and allocate handles later. This prevents heap fragmentation and avoids sending the<br>
Memory Manager into a tailspin.</p>
<p>
Be aware that some parts of the Toolbox, like Apple events, expect Memory Manager<br>
structures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the rest of the program's memory is allocated wisely to<br>
prevent heap fragmentation, even these allocations will happen quickly, with no<br>
impact on game performance. 
</p>
<p><b><i>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a compatible copy-protection scheme (if any). </i></b><br>
It's a matter of great controversy whether software should be copy-protected at all. No<br>
software protection scheme on the Macintosh has ever survived the talented efforts<br>
of Macintosh hackers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's always someone who will defeat your copy<br>
protection, no matter how convoluted it may be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many who consider such<br>
protection a puzzle and a challenge to break, so by putting it in you may be inviting<br>
piracy.</p>
<p>
But if you do decide you want some level of protection on your game, we strongly<br>
recommend against a disk-based protection scheme, which is guaranteed to break your<br>
program. Instead, we recommend using one (or a combination) of the methods<br>
described here. 
</p>
<p>
One method is to use serial numbers: when the software is installed, ask the user to<br>
enter the serial number from the disk label, and then imprint the software with the<br>
person's name. Another method involves requiring the user to enter a password from<br>
the manual every once in a while. If you do this, it's a nice touch to allow users who<br>
send you the registration card to disable the password dialog; once you have the<br>
registration card, you can link the customer to a serial number.
</p>
<p>
Consider also making the following checks: At installation time, use Gestalt to<br>
determine the characteristics of the machine you're installed on, and save these to<br>
your preferences file. Also, use FindFolder to record the directory ID of the System<br>
Folder, which is the same until a new System Folder is created. Every time your<br>
application starts up, make the same Gestalt and FindFolder calls to check whether<br>
you're running on the same machine; if not, have the user reinstall the software and<br>
reenter the serial number, or reenter the password from the manual. 
</p>
<p>
These techniques are the most compatible way to both protect your sales and minimize<br>
the kind of frustration customers experience with other password- or disk-based copy<br>
protection systems.
</p>
<p>
<b>ARE YOU GAME?</b><br>
That's not all! To help Macintosh game developers share tips, tricks, and information,<br>
Apple has set up the Game Development Discussion folder on AppleLink (in Developer<br>
Support: Developer Talk).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This board is read by Macintosh game development<br>
companies, other developers, and Apple engineers on a daily basis. Also, there's a<br>
folder on this issue's CD, called Game Development, that contains special resources<br>
Apple has put together to aid all game developers. 
</p>
<p>
So if you're tired of the scant choices on the Macintosh Entertainment shelf in your<br>
local software store, do something about it: write some games!
