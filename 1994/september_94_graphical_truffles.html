<p>
Wading through the vast sea of documentation you get with the QuickDraw GX Software<br>
Developer's Kit, you may not realize all the cool things this new graphics model lets<br>
you do. In this column, we'll look at just one of those cool things: clipping one shape to<br>
the inside of another arbitrary shape. As an illustration, we'll take a bitmapped image<br>
of a tropical beach (Figure 1) and clip it to the word "BAY" (Figure 2). Figure 3<br>
shows the result. There's a sample application and source code on this issue's CD. 
</p>
<p>
<b>CREATING THE SHAPES</b><br>
We'll be collecting the results of our operations into a picture shape. We'll assume<br>
that the QuickDraw GX environment has already been set up and that we have a window<br>
ready to draw into.
</p>
<p>
<b>For information </b>on setting up the QuickDraw GX environment, see "Getting Started<br>
With QuickDraw GX" in <i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 15. The full details are in<i> Inside Macintosh:</i><br>
<i>QuickDraw GX Objects</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;and<i> Inside Macintosh: QuickDraw GX Graphics.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;*
</p>
<p>
We start by creating an empty picture to which we can add shapes:
</p>
<pre>gxShape  thePicture;
thePicture = GXNewShape(gxPictureType);</pre>
<p>
The bitmap shape we'll be clipping (Figure 1) is stored in our application's resource<br>
fork as a 'pxmp' resource. We retrieve it with the GetPixMapShape call from the qd<br>
library.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<pre>gxShape theBitmap;
theBitmap = GetPixMapShape(kPixMapID);</pre>
<p>
To create the clip shape, we start with a text shape containing the word BAY. 
</p>
<pre>gxShape theClip;
theClip = GXNewText(3, (unsigned char*)"BAY", nil);</pre>

</p>
<p>
<b>POSITIONING AND SCALING THE TEXT SHAPE</b><br>
Before we set our text shape to be the clip of our bitmap shape, we need to move it to<br>
the top left corner of the bitmap shape and then scale it to encompass the entire<br>
bitmap.
</p>
<p>
We'll look at two ways to do this. The first method takes us through all the steps in the<br>
process, while the second is simpler and lets QuickDraw GX do more of the work for us.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The origin of a text shape is on the baseline, but in this case, because there are no<br>
descenders in the text, we just use the bottom left corner of the shape's bounds. We<br>
need to offset the text shape by its own height from the top of the bitmap shape. So we<br>
need to know the bounds of both the bitmap shape (to find the coordinates of its top left<br>
corner) and the text shape (to calculate its height):
</p>
<pre>gxRectangle     bitmapBounds, textBounds;
GXGetShapeBounds(theBitmap, 0, &amp;bitmapBounds);
GXGetShapeBounds(theClip, 0, &amp;textBounds);
textHeight = textBounds.bottom - textBounds.top;
GXMoveShapeTo(theClip, bitmapBounds.left,
          bitmapBounds.top + textHeight);</pre>
<p>
Our original text shape, which is the default text size of 12 points, isn't big enough to<br>
cover the entire bitmap shape. If we were to do the clipping at this point, we would get<br>
just a tiny piece of the corner instead of the whole bitmap. To get the whole thing, we<br>
have to scale the text shape to match the size of the bitmap shape.
</p>
<p>
For the text shape to scale linearly, without taking the font's hinting into account, we<br>
have to turn off QuickDraw GX's built-in metrics and contour grid-fitting capabilities.<br>
We do this by setting the shape's text attributes as follows:
</p>
<pre>GXSetShapeTextAttributes(theClip,
    gxNoMetricsGridText | gxNoContourGridText);</pre>
<p>
Although QuickDraw GX lets us clip to any arbitrary shape, clipping is actually limited<br>
to primitive shapes only. That is, the clip shape must be a shape whose geometry and<br>
fill properties by themselves define the shape; primitive shapes don't use information<br>
from a style or transform object. This is not a problem, though, because we can easily<br>
convert a shape to its primitive form. The following call does the job:
</p>
<pre>GXPrimitiveShape(theClip);</pre>
<p>
The result is a filled path shape (which is a primitive shape) representing the<br>
outlines of the letters in the word BAY. 
</p>
<p>
Next we need to determine how much to scale the text shape to encompass the entire<br>
bitmap shape.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do this by finding the width and height of both shapes' bounds<br>
rectangles and scaling the text shape in each direction by the ratio between the two:
</p>
<pre>Fixed           bitmapWidth, bitmapHeight;
Fixed           textWidth, textHeight;
Fixed           xScale, yScale;

// Determine the width ratio.
bitmapWidth = bitmapBounds.right - bitmapBounds.left;
textWidth = textBounds.right - textBounds.left;
xScale = FixedDivide(bitmapWidth, textWidth);

// Determine the height ratio.
bitmapHeight = bitmapBounds.bottom - bitmapBounds.top;
textHeight = textBounds.bottom - textBounds.top;
yScale = FixedDivide(bitmapHeight, textHeight);

GXScaleShape(theClip, xScale, yScale,
                 bitmapBounds.left, bitmapBounds.top);</pre>
<p>
We've now scaled the text shape to encompass the entire area of our bitmap shape, and<br>
we're ready to use it to clip the bitmap shape. But it turns out that there's a shorter<br>
way to do this; we can actually accomplish the same thing with only three lines of code:
</p>
<pre>GXSetShapeTextAttributes(theClip,
    gxNoMetricsGridText | gxNoContourGridText);
GXGetShapeBounds(theBitmap, 0, &amp;textBounds);
GXSetShapeBounds(theClip, &amp;textBounds);</pre>
<p>
As in the earlier method, we turn hinting off and get the bounds of our bitmap shape.<br>
The magic here is in the GXSetShapeBounds call: when applied to typographic shapes,<br>
this call positions and scales the text to the new bounds and converts it to a primitive<br>
shape. That's it! QuickDraw GX does the hard work for us automatically, and we're<br>
ready to set the clip of our bitmap shape. 
</p>
<p>
<b>SETTING THE CLIP SHAPE</b><br>
Now that the text shape is positioned and scaled the way we want it, we're ready to set<br>
it up as the clip of our bitmap shape:
</p>
<pre>GXSetShapeClip(theBitmap, theClip);</pre>
<p>
This call changes the clip shape contained within the transform used by our bitmap<br>
shape, replacing it with the new clip shape that we've created. 
</p>
<p>
<b>If the same transform </b> were being shared by other shapes, QuickDraw GX would<br>
make a copy of the transform to associate with our bitmap shape, ensuring that the<br>
new clip would not affect any of the other shapes sharing the same transform.*The<br>
next step is to add the clipped bitmap shape to our picture with GXSetPictureParts.<br>
(Note that we could also use the library call AddToShape or the core call<br>
GXSetShapeParts to do the same thing, but I chose to be more explicit here.)
</p>
<pre>GXSetPictureParts(thePicture, 0, 0, 1, &amp;theBitmap,
          nil, nil, nil);</pre>
<p>
The picture now contains a new reference to the original bitmap shape, complete with<br>
the new clip we've added to it. Once there's a reference to it in the picture, we don't<br>
need the original reference anymore, so we dispose of it:
</p>
<pre>GXDisposeShape(theBitmap);</pre>
<p>
<b>DRAWING THE OUTLINE</b><br>
The last order of business is to draw an outline around the clipped bitmap. We can<br>
accomplish this by setting up the drawing characteristics of our scaled text shape to<br>
draw the outline and then adding it to our picture. To frame the shape with a closed<br>
outline, we set its fill characteristic to gxClosedFrameFill. Since we want the frame to<br>
lie outside the geometry of the shape, we set its style attributes to<br>
gxOutsideFrameStyle. Finally, we set the pen size to 3 to get a satisfyingly fat outline,<br>
and we set the color of the outline to blue:
</p>
<pre>GXSetShapeFill(theClip, gxClosedFrameFill);
GXSetShapeStyleAttributes(theClip, gxOutsideFrameStyle);
GXSetShapePen(theClip, ff(3));
SetShapeCommonColor(theClip, blue);</pre>
<p>
Now we can add the outlined shape to our picture and dispose of it, as before:
</p>
<pre>GXSetPictureParts(thePicture, 0, 0, 1, &amp;theClip,
          nil, nil, nil);
GXDisposeShape(theClip);</pre>
<p>
<b>DRAWING THE PICTURE</b><br>
Before drawing our picture, we'll move it down a little from the top left corner of the<br>
window. We could do this by retrieving the picture's transform and shifting it down<br>
and to the right with GXMoveTransform; however, since the gxMapTransformShape<br>
attribute is set for pictures by default, we can just call GXMoveShape:
</p>
<pre>GXMoveShape(thePicture, f(20), ff(15));</pre>
<p>
Finally, we're ready to draw the picture:
</p>
<pre>GXDrawShape(thePicture);</pre>
<p>
We're done! The result should look like Figure 3.
</p>
<p>
<b>THAT'S ALL, FOLKS</b><br>
You've had a quick look at one of the many cool things you can do with the QuickDraw GX<br>
graphics system. As you can see from this example, the power and flexibility of<br>
QuickDraw GX can give your application the ability to do things you could only dream<br>
about until now.

<b>PETE ("LUKE") ALEXANDER</b>Regular readers of Luke's columns will know that he<br>
took his sabbatical from Apple this summer. He sent us a postcard: "Hey dudes! While<br>
you're looking out your windows at Silicon Valley smog, I'm looking out my windows at<br>
the rocky faces of Montana. Have you heard of National Parks? They're places of<br>
unusual beauty set apart from development.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that kind of development! The kind<br>
that causes smog. At Yellowstone Park I enjoyed the clear air, I found where the buffalo<br>
roam, and I learned why they call it Old Faithful. I'm now flying somewhere over<br>
Montana (don't worry, I'm steering with my knee), admiring the mountains with their<br>
lingering snow and enjoying the wide open spaces. Oops, mountain ahead and no more<br>
room on the card." He signed it, "See you later, Luke" but then crossed out the "See you<br>
later." We're worried, really worried.*
