I've been thinking about edges lately -- about the places where dissimilar domains<br>
meet and interact.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know how every now and then you come up with a new view on<br>
things? A new model to try to fit the facts into, a new lens to use to examine the world,<br>
a new pattern that you haven't noticed before but that suddenly seems pervasive? Edges<br>
are like that right now for me. It seems that everywhere I look I see edges, and the edge<br>
always seems to be where the action is. 
</p>
<p>
I think it started in January, when I was called for jury duty. I was promptly selected<br>
to serve on a long, complex, and sordid criminal trial. I've been called for jury duty<br>
only once before, and that time the experience was short and dull. I did serve on two<br>
juries, but neither trial lasted more than a couple of days, and they were both very<br>
mundane. This time was decidedly different. There were 4 defendants, 53 separate<br>
counts to decide, 3 different crime scenes, dozens of spent bullet casings and slugs and<br>
shotgun waddings to keep track of, something like 14 police witnesses and 6 or 8<br>
civilian witnesses, a two-inch thick stack of 8 by 10 color glossies, and lots more. The<br>
whole adventure took nine weeks to play out. Yow. 
</p>
<p>
The atmosphere in the courtroom spanned the full range of intensities. There was<br>
plenty of plodding boredom: day after somnolent day of slow, thorough, painstaking<br>
ballistics testimony, matching bullets to guns and mapping where they were found.<br>
There was high drama: the tapes of the police transmissions during the chase and as the<br>
final shootout began were filled with panic, screaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was humor: Helen in<br>
chair 5 often started to fall asleep in the afternoons. The court reporter would see her<br>
dropping off, make a little hissing noise, and Wes in chair 4 would surreptitiously<br>
nudge Helen back to consciousness. We'd all grin. 
</p>
<p>
But no matter what was happening at the moment, I found the<i>process</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;absolutely<br>
riveting, from beginning to end. Here were the great and mighty wheels of justice in<br>
America, slowly and ponderously turning, grinding away at the facts like so much dry<br>
corn under a millstone. The courtroom is a place where politics actually collides<br>
directly with people's lives, through the strange intervening filter called law. It's an<br>
edge, an active boundary separating two domains, where work actually gets done. 
</p>
<p>
I'm constantly drawn to active boundaries like that, places where two dynamic systems<br>
collide and affect each other. Interfaces. Precipices. Limits. Edges. And they are<br>
everywhere. In a previous column I pointed out an edge in the realm of language:<br>
semantics, where a language's structure collides with meaning and where the real<br>
work of the language -- creating meaning from abstract symbols -- gets done. In<br>
biology, there are edges all over the place. An obvious and important one is the<br>
semi-permeable membrane. It's the structure that allows life to create and control its<br>
own environment, and it's arguably the single most important structure enabling<br>
complex multicellular life to exist. Biologically active molecules are active because of<br>
their<i>shape</i> , their boundaries; proteins and enzymes work because they fit together<br>
with complementary molecules. In philosophy there is the edge between self and<br>
not-self, and teetering along this edge, hopping back and forth across it and trying to<br>
look at it from all angles, is how the work of philosophy gets done. In physics, often the<br>
edges are where the truly interesting -- and, not coincidentally, mathematically<br>
intractable -- stuff happens. (In engineering school, an all-too-common phrase was<br>
"ignore edge effects.")
</p>
<p>
All the exciting stuff seems to happen at edges. Large systems that incorporate feedback<br>
often exhibit a behavior known as "self-organized criticality" in which they evolve<br>
toward a critical state, an edge, and forevermore exist there, teetering on the<br>
crumbling lip of stability. A great example is a conical pile of sand on a circular plate,<br>
with grains being added to the top one at a time. Over time the overall shape of the pile<br>
will change very little, but if you turn up the magnification and look closely at the side<br>
of the pile, there are constant avalanches of all sizes, all extremely unpredictable and<br>
chaotic. This is an interesting dual behavior: at one scale there is incredible<br>
robustness; the overall shape of the pile is very stable and will always recover itself,<br>
even if disturbed. But on a smaller scale, the scale of an individual grain on the side of<br>
the pile, the dynamics are wildly unpredictable and incredibly<i>un</i> stable. The pile is<br>
poised at a limit, a dynamic balance between growth and decay. 
</p>
<p>
An interesting thing is how many different varieties of dynamic systems seem to<br>
exhibit this kind of behavior. The locations and magnitudes of earthquakes, fluctuations<br>
in traffic flow, the rise and fall of economic markets, the rhythmic variations in a<br>
heartbeat, the varying current through a resistor, and the population changes in an<br>
ecosystem all exhibit dynamic characteristics similar to the sand pile, and this is not<br>
an exhaustive list by any means. That state, pushed up against the edge of stability,<br>
seems to be a natural one. Life itself appears to be delicately poised on the boundary<br>
between order and chaos. 
</p>
<p>
In computers (you knew I was going to get around to this eventually, didn't you?), as<br>
in any complex system, there are lots of interesting edges and boundaries if you look<br>
for them. Internally, there's the place where the software collides with the hardware;<br>
sparks really fly down there, all right. Object- oriented programming is all about<br>
repackaging the boundaries between and among data and functions. (A large part of good<br>
object design is minimizing the "surface area" of your objects.) And then there's the<br>
edge of the computer itself. And I don't mean the plastic or metal surface of the box, but<br>
the<i>experiential</i> boundary, the true edge between the machine and the user, the<br>
interface. Here the animal collides with the machine, and the boundary between them<br>
is infinitely convoluted, elastic, dynamic, and interesting. 
</p>
<p>
For software designers, perhaps the most important lesson to be learned from the<br>
edge-centric view is this: the shape of a boundary defines the shape of things on<i>both</i> <br>
sides of the boundary simultaneously. The boundary of my dog Natty defines not only<br>
her own shape, but that of a Natty- shaped hole in the air as well. The edge between two<br>
interlocking tiles in an Escher drawing defines the shape of both tiles at once. If the<br>
edge in question is one we have control over, this can be very important. 
</p>
<p>
By programming a computer we're not only shaping the machine; we're also shaping<br>
the humans who use it. This is often overlooked, but is crucial to designing good<br>
software; it needs to<i>fit</i> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans are incredibly adaptable, and will contort<br>
themselves grotesquely to use awkward tools, if necessary. Like kids with their faces<br>
squashed against the toy store window, computer users smash themselves up against<br>
the interface -- even though it might hurt -- to get at what's inside. 
</p>
<p>
But because of the chameleon-like nature of the computer, we have more or less total<br>
control over the interface. So in principle we have the power to shape the computer to<br>
the user, rather than the other way around. We should be able to make a truly<br>
human-shaped dent in the computer, a dent people can slip into effortlessly and<br>
comfortably, like slipping into a fuzzy slipper. It's incredibly hard work, shaping the<br>
computer to the human, all that snipping and tucking and smoothing. It requires<br>
constant readjustment, painstaking attention to detail, and massive amounts of<br>
brute-force trial and error. But it's<i>good</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;work, some would say the work that humans<br>
are best at: the shaping of tools. 
</p>
<p>
So now here I am, seeing edges everywhere. Sigh. Last year it was basins of attraction,<br>
this year it's edges, next year maybe it'll be networks of interconnections. But there's<br>
one thing I can count on: every time I get tired of looking through one particular glass,<br>
there will be another within reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans have this uncanny ability to apply order<br>
to everything they see, to perceive structure in everything around them. Our minds<br>
seem to operate by forming and then reforming meaning, establishing and then<br>
reestablishing context, constantly slipping and adjusting to accommodate the relentless<br>
stream of input. Hmm. Just like that pile of sand.
