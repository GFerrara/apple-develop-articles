<i>OpenDoc, Apple's compound-document architecture, brings users a new, more</i><br>
<i>powerful metaphor for working with documents. Writing code to support OpenDoc is a</i><br>
<i>lot like writing a normal application. This article gives an overview of what's involved</i><br>
<i>in writing OpenDoc code and presents a simple working example.</i>
</p>
<p>
OpenDoc provides a new way to write application code for the Macintosh and a number<br>
of other desktop platforms. By following the OpenDoc guidelines, you can produce<br>
applications that share files, windows, and interface elements seamlessly. The process<br>
of writing an OpenDoc application, which we call a<i>part handler</i> , is much like writing<br>
any Macintosh application. There are differences as well, of course, and this article<br>
will help you understand them. 
</p>
<p>
OpenDoc applications are designed to allow code from several sources to cooperate in<br>
producing<i>compound documents</i> , documents that can embed almost any kind of content<br>
inside them. Each piece of content in the document (each<i>part</i> ) includes its own part<br>
handler, the code that's used to edit and view it. To achieve this, OpenDoc part handlers<br>
must cooperate in a number of ways. They must sort out how events are passed, where<br>
data is stored on the disk, and where drawing is allowed to occur on windows or printed<br>
pages. 
</p>
<p>
This article starts with a brief overview of OpenDoc and then talks about implementing<br>
a simple part handler. It will show you the absolute basics, much as TESample does for<br>
TextEdit in the Macintosh Toolbox. You'll learn about a simple example of building a<br>
part handler, included on this issue's CD: a clock that can handle two different display<br>
modes, digital and analog. The clock updates itself every second and allows the user to<br>
select the display mode from a menu. 
</p>
<p>
A quick caveat: The sample code provided on the CD is from the alpha version of<br>
OpenDoc, but by the time you read this, a beta version should be available. When you<br>
begin implementing your own part handler, you may find that some details of the API<br>
have changed; however, the overall structure will be the same. The sample clock, for<br>
instance, is specific to C++ and the alpha version of OpenDoc. The final version of<br>
OpenDoc will be based on IBM's System Object Model (SOM), which will allow part<br>
handlers to be written in a variety of languages, both object-oriented and procedural.<br>
Similarly, the<i>XMP</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;prefix on OpenDoc class names (you'll see a lot of them in this<br>
article) will be changed to<i>OD</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;beginning with the beta release. 
</p>
<p>
This is perhaps a good time to mention a bit more about SOM. This technology is the<br>
basic mechanism that OpenDoc part handlers use to communicate with one another.<br>
SOM solves many hard problems associated with using object-oriented languages,<br>
including those of subclassing across language boundaries, altering base classes under<br>
dynamic linking, and long-term maintenance of object-oriented APIs. 
</p>
<h2>OVERVIEW OF OPENDOC</h2>
<p>
Before getting into the specifics of OpenDoc and how to write part handlers, we'll talk<br>
about some of the basic services you'll see in OpenDoc and where your own code fits<br>
into the OpenDoc architecture. 
</p>
<p>
<b>PART HANDLERS</b><br>
Part handlers are what provide OpenDoc with its ability to handle different kinds of<br>
content in a single document. You, the developer community, will write the various<br>
part handlers that plug into OpenDoc. 
</p>
<p>
Part handlers are a lot like existing applications. They handle events, draw and print,<br>
and read and store data onto disk. Every part handler provides a series of entry points<br>
that allow OpenDoc to request any of these actions from the part handler. In addition,<br>
the API has a number of "bookkeeping calls," which allow OpenDoc to provide undo<br>
services and notify part handlers when their environment has changed. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, there are about 50 calls in the OpenDoc part API that a part needs to<br>
implement. This is a lot, but it actually maps fairly closely with the number of things<br>
you'd have to do to write any Macintosh application. In addition, you can ignore many of<br>
these calls in many cases. For instance, if you don't allow embedding of other parts<br>
within your part, there are about ten calls that you can safely ignore. If you don't<br>
update your display asynchronously, but simply wait for update calls, there are<br>
additional calls that you can ignore. In many typical cases, this means that you can<br>
build a part handler very quickly from existing code. 
</p>
<p>
Part handlers are packaged as shared libraries in the Macintosh version of OpenDoc.<br>
This won't always be the case on other OpenDoc platforms, but you can count on the API<br>
being the same on all platforms. The alpha version of OpenDoc uses the Apple Shared<br>
Library Manager to dynamically link your part handler into OpenDoc, while the beta<br>
version will use SOM. These versions will have different linker behavior but will<br>
essentially require the same basic packaging of your code: a shared library. 
</p>
<p>
In either case, you'll find that OpenDoc is an object-oriented API. That means you'll be<br>
talking to OpenDoc objects, and your part handler will itself be an OpenDoc object (or<br>
set of objects). This doesn't mean that your code has to be built from the ground up in<br>
C++, though. SOM will provide interfaces to many languages, including C. 
</p>
<p>
Because part handlers are themselves objects, we often refer to them as "part objects"<br>
or "parts" in conversation. In fact, what the user would call a "part" in a document is<br>
really the combination of some persistent data stored in the document file and a set of<br>
objects that OpenDoc uses to display and manipulate the stored data. OpenDoc chooses<br>
appropriate part handlers based on the type of data stored in the document. 
</p>
<p>
<b>RUNTIME OBJECTS</b><br>
As we describe how to write a part handler, we'll mention some runtime objects that<br>
interact with your code. In OpenDoc, these objects can be located at run time using the<br>
session object (XMPSession), to which your part object will be given a pointer when<br>
it's initialized. The session object is very important because it's your link to the rest<br>
of the OpenDoc objects that are running in the document. 
</p>
<p>
There's a whole list of objects that the session object makes available. Of these, only<br>
three will be important for the purposes of this article: the arbitrator, the<br>
dispatcher, and the undo stack.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The<i> arbitrator</i>  is an object of class XMPArbitrator. The arbitrator for a<br>
session is the place where part handlers register their ownership of certain<br>
resources. The menu bar, the keystroke stream, and the current selection are<br>
all examples of resources that the arbitrator tracks.</li>
<li> The<i> dispatcher</i> is the object that dispatches events to the various part<br>
handlers. It's an object of class XMPDispatcher. It's used in our example as a<br>
way to register for background time. </li>
<li> The<i> undo stack</i> is an object of class XMPUndo that allows OpenDoc to<br>
support multilevel undo across part handler boundaries. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these objects will be discussed as it's encountered. 
</p>
<h2>A RUNNING START</h2>
<p>
To give you a running start, we've built a small object-oriented framework for parts<br>
that implements the direct interface to OpenDoc. This framework is a precursor to the<br>
new part handler framework that Apple is building, and is included here simply as<br>
sample code. Our sample clock uses this framework. The good thing about the<br>
framework is that it clearly separates the work that any part handler must do to be<br>
OpenDoc compliant from the specific work performed in putting up a clock. 
</p>
<p>
The framework divides the work of a part into three objects: a frame object, a facet<br>
object, and a part object. OpenDoc itself doesn't require that you create anything but a<br>
part object, but for the sake of clarity the framework divides the labor among several<br>
smaller objects. For easy reference, here's a list of the classes we'll be discussing<br>
throughout the article and their corresponding source files, included on the CD:
</p>
<pre>    CPart       FWPart.h, FWPart.cpp
    CFrame      FWFrame.h, FWFrame.cpp
    CFacet      FWFacet.h, FWFacet.cpp
    CClockPart  ClockPar.h, ClockPar.cpp
    CClockFrame ClockFra.h, ClockFra.cpp
    CClockFacet ClockFac.h, ClockFac.cpp</pre>
<p>
The classes defined by the framework generally start with the letter<i>C</i> , hence the<br>
classes CPart, CFrame, and CFacet. These three parts are helper objects for three<br>
OpenDoc classes, XMPPart, XMPFrame, and XMPFacet. XMPPart objects are OpenDoc<br>
part handlers: you'll subclass XMPPart when writing your own. OpenDoc uses the<br>
frame and facet objects to help part handlers lay themselves out in a window. How<br>
these classes work together is probably the single most complex thing to understand in<br>
OpenDoc. 
</p>
<p>
XMPPart, the class from which part handlers are derived, is simply the base class of<br>
every OpenDoc part handler. It's the class that actually handles the drawing, editing,<br>
and storage. Every part handler is an implementation of some subclass of XMPPart. 
</p>
<p>
CPart, in the framework, is a class derived from XMPPart. It's just a default<br>
implementation of the basic XMPPart behavior. As such, CPart is a treasure trove of<br>
information about the correct way to "ignore" calls that aren't interesting because<br>
your part handler doesn't support embedding, update asynchronously, or use offscreen<br>
bitmaps. 
</p>
<p>
Every part is embedded in another part, with the exception of the<i>root part,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br>
top-level part in each compound document. When a part is embedded in another part,<br>
there's an object that's used to store information about the shape of the embedded part.<br>
This boundary between a container and an embedded part is a<i>frame</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;-- an instance of<br>
the class XMPFrame. Every frame has a single part displayed inside it. The container<br>
actually embeds the frame; it knows nothing about the part inside. 
</p>
<p>
Any part can be displayed in several frames at the same time. This makes it easy for a<br>
part to be visible in several windows or to have several different presentations. For<br>
example, a charting part might want to have one frame displaying the chart and<br>
another allowing the data to be edited in a table. 
</p>
<p>
A<i> facet</i> (an instance of an XMPFacet object) is a visible part of a frame. There can be<br>
many facets displaying within any given frame. This is a useful property, for instance,<br>
when a container wants to "split" windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both XMPFrames and XMPFacets have a<br>
field, partInfo, for storing information specific to the part being displayed. This is<br>
rather like a window refCon, a handy place to store information independent of the<br>
object itself. The CFrame and CFacet objects are designed to be plugged into the<br>
partInfo fields of their XMPFrame and XMPFacet counterparts. The containing part<br>
creates the XMPFrame and XMPFacet objects and then allows your part handler to<br>
initialize their partInfo fields. In the framework, the actual work of drawing the part<br>
on the screen is done in the CFacet object. The work of deciding what shape the<br>
embedded part will take is done in the CFrame object. As we describe the specific<br>
operations, we'll point out the class in which the code resides. 
</p>
<h2>INITIALIZATION CODE</h2>
<p>
The first bit of code we'll consider is the initialization code for each part object. Each<br>
distinct part in a document gets an instance of the part object, so if there are seven<br>
little clocks running in different windows (or the same window, for that matter) there<br>
are seven instances of the clock part object.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that you probably want to<br>
come up with a scheme to share any global data so that you aren't wasting space with<br>
many copies of it. Both the Apple Shared Library Manager and SOM support<br>
systemwide global storage, so this should be straightforward. 
</p>
<p>
Resources are a special case. You'll want to be very polite about not permanently<br>
fiddling with the resource chain or making assumptions about where your resource<br>
file is in the chain. We suggest saving the previous head of the resource chain, setting<br>
your file to be the end of the chain, and using the single-level resource calls (such as<br>
Get1IndResource) to find the resources you're after. Since you'll probably want to<br>
share the resources among separate instances of your part object, it may be better to<br>
detach the resources you get and manage them yourself instead of counting on any<br>
particular application heap to have the correct resource map. 
</p>
<p>
<b>THE CONSTRUCTOR</b><br>
The first step in initialization is the<i>constructor</i> . You should never do anything that<br>
could possibly fail in a constructor. This pretty much limits you to operations like<br>
setting pointer variables to NULL, setting numeric variables to appropriate values,<br>
and making similar assignments from constants. 
</p>
<p>
You can see a good example in ClockPar.cpp. The clock part simply sets up its fields<br>
with appropriate constant values. 
</p>
<p>
<b>XMPPART::INITPART</b><br>
The next phase of initialization takes place in the InitPart method that every part<br>
object implements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The InitPart method is called by OpenDoc after the part object has<br>
been created, and here you<i>can</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;attempt things that can fail. This is where you should<br>
attempt to allocate any extra memory you need for your part instance, get resources if<br>
you need them, and set up your persistent storage. 
</p>
<p>
Let's examine how OpenDoc's storage system looks to a part handler. When your part<br>
object is created, the InitPart method is passed a<i>storage unit</i> object in which you can<br>
persistently store information. A storage unit is really just a list of named<i>properties</i> ,<br>
each of which has one or more<i>values</i> . Each value is an entire stream, like an existing<br>
Macintosh file. You can do read, write, seek, insert, and delete operations on individual<br>
values.
</p>
<p>
Each value has a type, much like the type code associated with a Macintosh file. Every<br>
property in a storage unit can have one or more values, each with their own type code.<br>
Thus, you can store multiple representations of any property. You can make up any<br>
property names you like. One special property name, kXMPPropContents, is used by<br>
OpenDoc to determine which handler goes with which part at run time. Every part<br>
object should have a property named kXMPPropContents so that OpenDoc can determine<br>
what part handler to run. 
</p>
<p>
In our sample, CClockPart has an Initialize method, which is called by CPart::InitPart.<br>
It sets up the menu bar for the clock and sets up a focus set for obtaining system<br>
resources from the arbitrator (more about this later). A good example of code to set up<br>
persistent storage can be found in the implementation of CPart. The framework calls<br>
its own method, called CheckAndAddProperties, to make sure that the storage unit is<br>
set up correctly. 
</p>
<h2>DRAWING CODE</h2>
<p>
Now that your initialization code is in place, you'll want to make sure you can get your<br>
part to draw onscreen. OpenDoc will call your part with the Draw method and tell you<br>
which facet should be drawn. 
</p>
<p>
Our sample, CClockPart, inherits some code from CPart that asks the CFacet object to<br>
do the drawing. Notice, though, that before it does this, CPart::Draw sets up the<br>
graphics port for drawing using the clipping information from the facet. This is very<br>
similar to the basic drawing model for the Macintosh, where you draw using the<br>
appropriate graphics port and clipping region. You can find the rest of the drawingcode<br>
in CClockFacet::Draw. This code consists of just the straightforward QuickDraw calls<br>
and attendant calculations needed to display either the digital or the analog clock face. 
</p>
<p>
We use a utility class called CDrawInitiator to set up the drawing environment<br>
reliably. The constructor of this class does all the work of setting the graphics port's<br>
clipping region and origin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, the destructor restores the port to its previous<br>
state. This is a tricky bit of C++ coding that takes advantage of the object allocation<br>
behavior of stack-based objects in C++. 
</p>
<p>
<b>HANDLING LAYOUT</b><br>
One of the features of CClockPart is that it presents a round shape when it's embedded.<br>
To do this, it uses the XMPFrame object's layout negotiation features.&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand<br>
this, you need to understand the notions of canvas, shape, and transform in OpenDoc.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A<i> canvas</i> is simply a drawing context. On the Macintosh it can be either a<br>
QuickDraw graphics port or a QuickDraw GX view port.</li>
<li>A<i> shape</i>  is a way of describing an area of a canvas. OpenDoc supports<br>
describing shapes in terms of polygons, regions, or rectangles on the<br>
Macintosh.</li>
<li>A<i> transform</i>  is a geometric transformation appropriate to the type of<br>
canvas in use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In QuickDraw, the only transformation available is an offset.<br>
In QuickDraw GX, the transformations are much more powerful, capable of<br>
scaling, rotating, and offsets, as well as some more interesting<br>
transformations such as skewing. </li>
</ul>
<p>
An OpenDoc frame has a set of shapes associated with it. One, called the<i>frame shape</i> , is<br>
how the container tells an embedded object how to lay itself out. Your part handler<br>
should use the frame shape to decide what to display and how to lay it out. When your<br>
part is finished laying itself out, it can optionally specify to the container exactly what<br>
part of the frame shape it plans to use. This shape is called the<i>used shape</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;of the frame.<br>
Finally, the embedded part can specify an<i>active shape</i> , which is the subset of the<br>
frame shape that you want to use for determining whether you receive a mouse event.<br>
Often the used shape and the active shape are set to be the same shape. The container<br>
can take care of filling in any areas left untouched by the part handler. 
</p>
<p>
For example, assume we have a clock part embedded in a word processor that does text<br>
wrapping.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word processor allows its embedded frames to be laid out as rectangles.<br>
When the clock is embedded, it uses the frame shape (the rectangle given by the word<br>
processor) to determine the size of the clock face. After determining the size, it sets<br>
its used and active shapes to match the shape of the round clock face. The word<br>
processor is now free to wrap text around the round clock face, and any clicks in the<br>
rectangular frame shape that aren't actually on the clock face are passed through to the<br>
word processor. Those clicks can be used to manipulate the text that's wrapped close to<br>
the clock face. 
</p>
<p>
CClockPart negotiates to get the frame shape to match the clock's round face. This<br>
works but is not strictly necessary. Instead, it could simply set its used shape to match<br>
the round area of the clock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either method will ensure that the container knows how<br>
to clip any underlying parts so that they don't draw in the clock's area. 
</p>
<p>
A quick aside about shape negotiation: Negotiation is rather straightforward in<br>
OpenDoc, but knowledgeable programmers will notice that there is little support for<br>
constrained negotiation. This is not an oversight, but instead a fundamental design<br>
choice. It's up to the embedding part toconstrain layout according to its model of<br>
content. This means that constraint strategies like "Boxes &amp; Glue" or "Springs &amp;<br>
Wires" are the province of your part handler, not OpenDoc. You can implement any of a<br>
number of layout constraint schemes on top of OpenDoc, but every part handler may<br>
constrain layout within its own frame. 
</p>
<p>
You can see what happens when the container reshapes the clock in the method<br>
CClockFrame::FrameShapeChanged. CClockFrame requests a round shape from the<br>
container and then invalidates the correct areas so that redrawing occurs. For most<br>
parts, the standard behavior is to redo the layout based on the new shape, update the<br>
active and used shapes of the frame, and then invalidate the proper areas. 
</p>
<h2>EVENT HANDLING</h2>
<p>
Our next area of implementation is the event handling for the clock part. This is much<br>
like writing the event handling for any Macintosh application, with one difference: you<br>
don't poll the system for events by calling WaitNextEvent. Instead, when there's an<br>
event for your part handler OpenDoc calls your part's HandleEvent method. 
</p>
<p>
<b>XMPPART::HANDLEEVENT</b><br>
The code inside HandleEvent is usually a switch statement, just as in applications<br>
today. There are some minor differences, which are nicely illustrated by the code that<br>
CClockPart inherits from CPart. This code effectively delegates the various events to<br>
code that can handle each event, using a switch statement. Notice the behavior for<br>
mouse-down events, which calls CFacet::HandleMouseDown, which in turn causes the<br>
frame to become active if it isn't already. 
</p>
<p>
The notion of activation in OpenDoc is closely tied to the object discussed briefly<br>
earlier, the arbitrator. An object is "active" if it owns some of the foci in the<br>
arbitrator. A<i>focus</i> is just a shared data structure or system service of some kind, such<br>
as the menu bar or keystroke stream. 
</p>
<p>
When CClockFrame is told to activate, it requests a set of foci from the arbitrator.&nbsp;&nbsp;In<br>
this case, it wants the menus and selection focus. These two, with the addition of the<br>
keystroke stream, constitute the basic focus set that almost every part asks for when<br>
it wants to allow editing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can find the code that sets up the focus set in<br>
CClockFrame::InitClockFrame. In CFrame::ActivateFrame, the focus set is requested. 
</p>
<p>
Notice that the part is requesting the menu focus before it attempts to put up its menu<br>
bar. This is the basic rule to follow in all cases. If there's an arbitrator focus for the<br>
resource, you must request it and succeed in getting it before it's OK to use the<br>
resource. OpenDoc uses the arbitrator to carefully manage the sharing of data and<br>
system services, so it's very important to do the right thing and ask for foci whenever<br>
you need shared resources. 
</p>
<p>
<b>PUTTING UP A MENU BAR</b><br>
One of the things that CClockPart does is to set up a menu bar. You can see the code for<br>
this in CClockPart::Initialize. The initialization code gets a reference to its menu bar<br>
object and then calls the AddMenu method of the menu bar object to add its menus.<br>
Finally, it registers command IDs to pass back when menu items are selected. 
</p>
<p>
OpenDoc provides a menu bar object to help you set up menus and display them when<br>
your part has obtained the menu focus. The major reason for this object to exist at all<br>
is to support compatibility with Microsoft's proprietary OLE 2.0 document<br>
architecture. This object hides the complex menu- mixing behavior of OLE 2.0 behind<br>
a simple interface that works correctly in either an OpenDoc or an OLE 2.0 container. 
</p>
<p>
Later, during execution of CFrame::FocusStateChanged, the menu bar object is asked to<br>
display itself. The actual code invoked is in CPart::InstallMenus, and basically just<br>
calls the Display method of the menu bar object. 
</p>
<p>
<b>GETTING IDLE TIME</b><br>
You can get background time, delivered as idle events, on any of your frames. This is<br>
done by getting the dispatcher from the session object and registering particular<br>
frames for idle time. 
</p>
<p>
You can see an example of this sort of registration in CClockPart::Initialize. In this<br>
case, the part itself is registering to receive idle events, but individual frames can<br>
also be registered. Once a frame or part has been registered for idle time, it will<br>
receive idle events in its HandleEvent method. 
</p>
<p>
<b>UNDO AND REDO</b><br>
Although CClockPart is too simple to support undo, it's worthwhile to look at how you<br>
would go about adding undo support to your OpenDoc part handler. We've tried to make<br>
it as simple and unobtrusive as possible to do multilevel undo in OpenDoc. 
</p>
<p>
The first step is to create code that tells OpenDoc you've done something that can be<br>
undone. You do this by getting the undo object, an instance of XMPUndo, from the<br>
session object. You then call the XMPUndo::AddActionToHistory method, which takes a<br>
hunk of data that you create to hold instructions about how to undo the latest action.<br>
OpenDoc never looks inside this hunk of bits; it merely stores it for later. 
</p>
<p>
The code might look like this:
</p>
<pre>fSession-&gt;GetUndo()-&gt;AddActionToHistory(thisPart, myUndoData,
    kXMPSingleAction, myUndoString, myRedoString)</pre>
<p>
myUndoData is a pointer to the undo data, and myUndoString and myRedoString are<br>
strings to show in the Edit menu, to tell the user what action will be undone or redone.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Once the information is on the undo stack, simply calling the XMPUndo::Undo and<br>
XMPUndo::Redo methods will cause the system to send the correct messages to the parts<br>
to get the last action undone. This allows the user to undo actions that were made in<br>
other parts, without your part knowing precisely what needs to be done. 
</p>
<p>
When the undo object is told to undo or redo, it calls your part handler back using the<br>
Undo or Redo method. If you never post undo actions, you never need worry about<br>
having these methods called, and you can ignore them. The XMPUndo object will always<br>
return exactly what you store in it, and it makes sure that undo and redo operations<br>
are invoked in the correct order. When the Undo object is finished withthe undo data, it<br>
asks your part to dispose of it by calling your part's DisposeActionStatemethod. This<br>
means that you can safely put pointers to other data into the undo data, since you'll get<br>
a chance to dispose of the data, and anything it points to, at a later time. 
</p>
<p>
On some systems, such as one that supports persistent undo stacks, you may be asked<br>
to read and write your undo data against a persistent storage medium. This is not the<br>
case on the Macintosh, but OpenDoc does allow for it. You can safely ignore this until it<br>
becomes an issue on some platform you choose to support. 
</p>
<h2>STORAGE</h2>
<p>
Eventually it becomes time to save a document. We've already discussed the<br>
OpenDocstorage environment to some degree. The storage unit object in OpenDoc is set<br>
up for the part by the OpenDoc libraries themselves, so generally a part never needs<br>
to talk directly to the file system just to read and write its own data. This system<br>
supports not only compound document storage, but also a versioning system that allows<br>
for multiple drafts. 
</p>
<p>
<b>DEALING WITH STORAGE UNITS</b><br>
Once you've been given a storage unit, you typically get it ready by using the Focus<br>
call. To minimize the API, a set of common functions that can apply to the entire<br>
storage unit, a particular property, or a particular value has been abstracted out.<br>
Properties and values within a storage unit are not represented by distinct objects,<br>
but are instead captured in the focus state of the storage unit: the Focus method sets up<br>
the context for later calls. For example, the Remove method can apply to an entire<br>
property or to a single value of it, depending on whether the storage unit was focused<br>
on the property or on a value. Focusing can be absolute (when you pass a particular<br>
property ID or value index) or relative (when you pass a position code). 
</p>
<p>
The read operation is performed with the XMPStorageUnit::GetValue method, and the<br>
write operation with XMPStorageUnit::SetValue. The position can be set or read with<br>
XMPStorageUnit::SetOffset and XMPStorageUnit::GetOffset. Efficient inserts and deletes<br>
can be performed with XMPStorageUnit::InsertValue andXMPStorageUnit::DeleteValue.<br>
You can also use the latter call to truncate a given value. 
</p>
<p>
Typically, your part will focus on the kXMPPropContents property and do various<br>
reads or writes, depending on whether your part is being internalized (read in from<br>
storage) or externalized (written out). If your part is sufficiently large and complex,<br>
you'll probably want to use inserts and deletes to store changes to your persistent data.<br>
This has two useful effects: it makes your data more randomly accessible, and it makes<br>
the OpenDoc draft system store changes more efficiently.
</p>
<p>
This draft system allows a user to save a draft of a document and return to view the<br>
draft at any future time. Where possible, it stores only the changes between succeeding<br>
drafts, instead of storing entire copies of the document for each draft. By using<br>
OpenDoc's storage APIs, you automatically get this efficient storage of separate<br>
versions with no additional work on your part. OpenDoc only watches the storage<br>
operations, though; it doesn't attempt to detect differences on its own. If you use insert<br>
and delete operations, OpenDoc's storage system can efficiently store the changes<br>
between drafts. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BASIC I/O FOR YOUR PART</b><br>
When your part is brought into memory, your InitPartFromStorage method is called,<br>
and it's passed a storage unit. You are then responsible for reading the storage unit and<br>
getting ready to receive other messages. This will happen once, and never again until<br>
the object is deleted from memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, when the document is being saved, your<br>
part's Externalize method is called. You must immediately write anything you need to<br>
store persistently out into your storage unit, before returning from this method. 
</p>
<p>
Your part is also free to write to its storage unit, as well as read from it, whenever it<br>
wants to. For part handlers that "virtualize" themselves from disk, this means that<br>
OpenDoc won't get in your way. 
</p>
<p>
The CClockPart::InternalizeContent and CClockPart::ExternalizeContent methodsare<br>
called by the framework in response to the standard methods InitPartFromStorageand<br>
Externalize. They demonstrate focusing a storage unit and doing read and write<br>
operations. CClockPart's storage needs are very simple; it just reads and writes a few<br>
flags into its storage unit. 
</p>
<p>
<b>PART INFORMATION ATTACHED TO FRAMES</b><br>
As mentioned earlier, the XMPFrame objects associated with embedding have a partInfo<br>
field, which is used like a window refCon by your code. When the document is saved,<br>
you may be asked to save the contents of this partInfo field to a particular storage unit.<br>
Your part will be called using the XMPPart::WritePartInfo method. Your<br>
responsibility is to write enough information to be able to reconstruct the partInfo<br>
field. Later, when the document is reopened, your part object will be called with the<br>
XMPPart::ReadPartInfo method. This is your cue to read the data back into memory and<br>
set up the part info for that frame object once again. 
</p>
<p>
These partInfo fields are useful when you want to write a part that can have several<br>
visible frames, each with a different presentation. The chart example we used earlier<br>
is a case in point. We would want to allow a chart to be viewed as a table of data or a<br>
chart, possibly one of various chart kinds. By storing information about what to<br>
display in the frame's part info, you're freed from writing your own data structure to<br>
remember what kind of display to do in what frame. Instead, you store that information<br>
as a part of the frame's part info and implement WritePartInfo and ReadPartInfo<br>
methods to save and restore the data.&nbsp;&nbsp;CClockPart doesn't actually use the partInfo field<br>
of its frames in a persistent fashion. It simply inherits code from CPart, which<br>
reconstructs the appropriate CFrame and CFacet objects at run time. This is<br>
completely adequate for simple parts. 
</p>
<h2>BEING A GOOD OPENDOC CITIZEN</h2>
<p>
Now that we've covered the basics, there are a few last details to implement before<br>
we've got a good basic part. Since a part can have multiple frames, and a frame can be<br>
visible in multiple facets, we need to make sure our part handler does the right thing<br>
and avoids stepping on the toes of other parts. 
</p>
<p>
<b>ADDING AND REMOVING FACETS</b><br>
When a part becomes visible (that is, when a facet appears), OpenDoc notifies the part<br>
with a call to the FacetAdded method. This is when your part should do any special setup<br>
it needs to (for instance, you may want to register for idle time on the frame<br>
associated with that facet). Similarly, OpenDoc calls your part handler's FacetRemoved<br>
method when the facet goes away; here you should clean up any actions you took in<br>
response to FacetAdded. 
</p>
<p>
<b>ADJUSTING MENUS</b><br>
When your part handler acquires the menu focus, OpenDoc calls its AdjustMenus<br>
method. Your job is to correctly update the menus so that the right elements<br>
arechecked, enabled, and so on. You can see an example in<br>
CClockPart::DoAdjustMenus,which is called by the inherited code from<br>
CPart::AdjustMenus. 
</p>
<p>
<b>RELINQUISHING ARBITRATOR FOCI</b><br>
Once you've acquired any focus from the arbitrator, you'll eventually be called on to<br>
release it. This will happen via three methods: XMPPart::BeginRelinquishFocus,<br>
XMPPart::CommitRelinquishFocus, and XMPPart::AbortRelinquishFocus. The first<br>
method is called to ask your part if it's willing to relinquish a focus it owns. It should,<br>
if at all possible, say yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's possible, though, that you won't give up a focus,<br>
because your part object is in a mode. For instance, you wouldn't give up the serial<br>
port focus if you were in the middle of an XMODEM transfer. 
</p>
<p>
Once your part has responded to the XMPPart::BeginRelinquishFocus call, you can<br>
expect another call shortly after that which informs your part that the focus has<br>
really been given to another frame, or that it hasn't. The first case is signaled by<br>
XMPPart::CommitRelinquishFocus, and the second case is signaled by<br>
XMPPart::AbortRelinquishFocus. 
</p>
<p>
Occasionally, under difficult conditions, your part will simply be informed that it has<br>
either acquired a focus (through the XMPPart::FocusAcquired method) or lost a focus<br>
(through the XMPPart::FocusLost method). If your part has lost a focus, you're<br>
expected to avoid inappropriate behavior, such as attempting to adjust menus or<br>
display a menu bar when you don't have the menu bar focus. 
</p>
<p>
<b>FREEING MEMORY</b><br>
Your part is expected, if possible, to free some memory on request. When it's needed,<br>
you'll be called with the XMPPart::Purge method. You're given a size that's the amount<br>
of memory requested. If you can manage it, you should free any unneeded memory from<br>
your part's data structures. Don't free anything you need to keep running, of course.<br>
You might free any resources you were holding, or free some cached data. CClockPart,<br>
our example, is so simple that it has almost nothing to purge. 
</p>
<h2>IN CLOSING</h2>
<p>
By now you should have a good idea of what's involved in writing an OpenDoc part<br>
handler. As you've seen, it's much like writing an application today: you still write<br>
code to handle events, deal with storage issues, draw to the screen, and so on. The main<br>
differences are really in the "packaging" of the code and in the environment it runs in.<br>
(Some previously messy areas have even been cleanly abstracted for you. The storage<br>
system is a good example: no more ugly file handling code; you just deal with storage<br>
units and let OpenDoc handle the details.)
</p>
<p>
But the differences for users are amazing. No more worrying about which application<br>
can open which document. Instead, when they select a particular type of content to<br>
work with, the tools they need to work with that content simply appear. In user tests,<br>
many people thought that this radically wonderful technology was just a bug fix, and<br>
that it was finally working the way it was always supposed to. There can be no better<br>
indication that OpenDoc is a step in the right direction.
