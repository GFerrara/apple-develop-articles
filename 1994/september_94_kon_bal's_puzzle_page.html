<p>
Steve I've got a machine that crashed into MacsBug. I think it's this bug that some of<br>
our beta testers have been reporting; it's <i> really</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;intermittent, so I may not get it to<br>
happen again. I've got to find it just by looking at this one crash.
</p>
<p>
KON It's not reproducible?
</p>
<p>
Steve Not if it's the bug I've been hearing about. The reports are always the same: The<br>
machine crashes while saving a file. Afterward the file is unreadable. If they go back to<br>
an older copy of the file, the problem doesn't recur. No single user seems to have had<br>
this crash happen more than twice, and no one has been able to associate it with<br>
something they were doing in the program before they told it to save.
</p>
<p>
BAL What does this program do?
</p>
<p>
Steve It's a PIM -- personal information manager. Data entry and dialog boxes and<br>
stuff. It's a pretty big program, but very vanilla in its use of the ROM -- strictly<br>
Volume I stuff, plus the Memory Manager and File Manager, of course.
</p>
<p>
KON You've tried stress testing? Heap scramble, low-memory conditions, MemHell,<br>
QC, all of that?
</p>
<p>
Steve Yeah. It was a war zone, and we couldn't bring out the bug. But it just happened to<br>
one of our tech support people, Stephanie. I've taken over her machine until I can<br>
figure out what's going on. She closed a file, it asked her if she wanted to save changes,<br>
she clicked Yes, and it crashed into MacsBug with an illegal instruction.
</p>
<p>
BAL Illegal instruction? Sounds like you've branched off into the middle of nowhere.<br>
Where's the program counter?
</p>
<p>
<b>100</b> Steve<b> wh pc</b> says we're in CODE segment 44, $017C bytes into a routine called<br>
Preflush. According to a link map I can look at on another machine, segment 44 has the<br>
file-saving code.
</p>
<p>
KON Is the heap trashed?
</p>
<p>
<b>95</b> Steve MacsBug says the heap is fine.
</p>
<p>
BAL Perhaps some random memory-trashing bug has overwritten part of the code<br>
segment. Disassemble around the program counter.
</p>
<p>
<b>90</b> Steve It looks like valid code, but the PC is in the middle of an instruction.
</p>
<p>
KON Do you have any purgeable code segments?
</p>
<p>
<b>85</b> Steve We have a fairly complicated code segment management scheme based on<br>
reference counting. We're pretty careful about it, though; it's been a long time since<br>
we've had any problems there. As it happens, segment 44 is purgeable, but it has too<br>
many entry points to do reference counting, so we just unload it from our event loop.
</p>
<p>
BAL Sounds like code right out of the Finder. Let's try to find out how we managed to<br>
branch into the middle of an instruction. Do a stack crawl and see where we came from.<br>
Let's look at all the registers to see if one of them contains a clue as to how we got here.
</p>
<p>
<b>80</b> Steve OK. <b>sc6</b> says the last call came from a function named "Document::<br>
SaveAs(int, unsigned char)".
</p>
<p>
KON What kind of a function name is that? It looks more like a UNIX pathname than a<br>
function name.
</p>
<p>
Steve Hey, you should see what it looks like with name unmangling&nbsp;&nbsp;disabled. <b>sc7</b><br>
shows another return address under that one, in "Document::SaveAs(char*, short,<br>
unsigned char, int, unsigned char)".
</p>
<p>
BAL SaveAs? I thought it was just doing a regular save. And why two functions called<br>
SaveAs?
</p>
<p>
<b>75</b> Steve Stephanie insists that it was a regular save -- the document had been opened<br>
from an existing file and was being saved to that same file.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if that were true, the<br>
program should have called a function&nbsp;&nbsp;named Save, not SaveAs. As far as having two<br>
functions with the same name, the five- parameter one saves into a specified disk file;<br>
the two-parameter one brings up a Standard File dialog and then calls the<br>
five-parameter one. I'm using C++ function overloading.
</p>
<p>
BAL You sure you're not running the Finder? Mercer should be able to solve this for<br>
you in a snap.
</p>
<p>
KON I heard Mercer moved to Chicago. So, how did we get called?
</p>
<p>
<b>70</b> Steve The call came from a "JSR (A1)" instruction. It looks like a standard C++<br>
virtual function call.
</p>
<p>
KON What's the value of A1?
</p>
<p>
Steve It points into the jump table. Disassembling at that address shows a JMP to the<br>
current program counter.
</p>
<p>
KON That makes sense. Virtual function tables are stored in the global data segment, so<br>
their function pointers are data-to-code references, which have to go through the<br>
jump table. So all virtual function calls go through the jump table. That would be<br>
necessary no matter how the vtables were implemented, since at link time there's no<br>
way of knowing what version of the function will get called or what segment it's in.
</p>
<p>
BAL So the jump table is trashed relative to the data in the heap. I still think<br>
something's wrong with the heap. MacsBug can be funny about deciding whether a heap<br>
is trashed. Do a heap dump and page down until you see the block containing the<br>
program counter.
</p>
<p>
<b>65</b> Steve It's code segment 44, and everything around it looks reasonable. But there's<br>
a question mark next to the master pointer address.
</p>
<p>
KON That probably means the master pointer doesn't point back to this heap block.<br>
Let's look at the header for the heap block and find its master pointer to double-check<br>
MacsBug. The format of the header depends on whether the machine is using 24- or<br>
32-bit addressing. We can tell the current mode, which is probably the machine's<br>
standard mode unless we're in some slimy QuickDraw code, by looking at MacBug's<br>
status display along the left side of the screen.
</p>
<p>
Steve MacsBug says the machine is in 24-bit mode. It's an old IIci with only 8 meg of<br>
memory.
</p>
<p>
BAL In that case, the block header is 8 bytes long. The first byte is a tag byte that<br>
indicates the type of block (free, pointer, or handle) and the slop factor; the next<br>
three bytes are the size; and for handles, the final four bytes are the offset from the<br>
beginning of the heap zone to the master pointer for this block. Check that offset in the<br>
heap and make sure there's a valid master pointer there.
</p>
<p>
<b>60</b> Steve It agrees with the location printed in the heap dump. But the value in that<br>
master pointer doesn't point back to this heap block. It turns out MacsBug won't flag<br>
this as heap corruption, but it will put a question mark next to the master pointer for<br>
blocks where the master pointer doesn't make sense.
</p>
<p>
KON Do a heap dump and keep paging down until you find the address that it does point<br>
to.
</p>
<p>
<b>55</b> Steve It points to a block labeled "CODE segment 44". There are two code segment<br>
44s in the heap!
</p>
<p>
KON Is there a question mark on this one?
</p>
<p>
<b>50</b> Steve No, MacsBug seems to be happy with the second block. According to MacsBug,<br>
it has the same master pointer address as the first block. Both blocks are marked as<br>
being locked and purgeable.
</p>
<p>
BAL But the master pointer really does point to this block, so there's no question<br>
mark. And "locked and purgeable" is the expected state for a purgeable code segment<br>
that's currently loaded -- the lock flag overrides the purgeable flag.
</p>
<p>
KON To decide whether a heap block is a resource, MacsBug looks at the resource flag<br>
for the block. In a 24-bit heap, that flag is stored in the high byte of the master<br>
pointer. Since both blocks think they have the same master pointer, they're sharing<br>
the same flag byte; and when MacsBug searches the open resource maps to figure out<br>
which resource each block comes from, it gets the same answer.
</p>
<p>
BAL Now we have two mysteries: why there are two heap blocks with the same master<br>
pointer, and why the jump table points into the middle of a routine. Let's see if the<br>
heap blocks are really the same. Check the heap dump to see if they have the same size,<br>
and then dump memory from each one to see if they're the same.
</p>
<p>
<b>45</b> Steve They are the same. And by the way, you left out one mystery: If we're doing a<br>
Save, why is SaveAs on the stack? There's no way that the two-parameter SaveAs can<br>
call the five-parameter SaveAs without first bringing up the Standard File dialog; but<br>
Stephanie insists there was no such dialog.
</p>
<p>
KON Maybe we took another bad branch through the jump table earlier on. Take<br>
another look at the stack crawl. When did we first enter segment 44?
</p>
<p>
<b>40</b> Steve A routine called OKToClose, which is not in segment 44, called the<br>
two-parameter SaveAs, which is.
</p>
<p>
BAL Look at the JSR instruction in OKToClose.
</p>
<p>
<b>35</b> Steve It's jumping to an A5-relative address, in the jump table. That address<br>
contains a JMP into the middle of the two-parameter SaveAs, shortly before the place<br>
where it calls the five-parameter version.
</p>
<p>
KON Aha! By taking a wild branch into the middle of the routine, it skipped over the<br>
call to Standard File. Maybe all the jump table entries for this segment are skewed by<br>
the same amount. Disassemble from $017C bytes above where this JMP points.
</p>
<p>
<b>30</b> Steve $017C bytes above the JMP target is the beginning of Document::Save.
</p>
<p>
BAL That makes sense. OKToClose tried to call into segment 44 to the Save routine, but<br>
something went wrong with LoadSeg, and it ended up $017C bytes farther down, in the<br>
middle of the two-parameter SaveAs. Two-parameter SaveAs called five-parameter<br>
SaveAs; this is an intra-segment call, so it wasn't affected by the bad jump table. Then<br>
five-parameter SaveAs called Preflush, which is a virtual function, so it went through<br>
the jump table even though it's in the same segment. This time the wild branch<br>
happened to hit an illegal instruction, so it dropped into MacsBug.
</p>
<p>
KON It's interesting that the two SaveAs routines were able to function more or less<br>
correctly even though OKToClose branched into the middle of the first routine, thus<br>
bypassing all of its parameter setup.
</p>
<p>
BAL Well, it sounds like all of these functions are methods of the same object. MPW's<br>
C++ compiler usually puts the object pointer in A4. So any references to object data<br>
members or virtual functions would work even though we skipped the entry code for<br>
the first SaveAs.
</p>
<p>
KON Aren't all C++ functions fairly interchangeable? Link, save A4, load A4, test a bit<br>
off A4, restore A4, unlink, rts? That's part of the efficiency.
</p>
<p>
BAL In any case, we need to find out what went wrong in the LoadSeg call. Maybe there's<br>
a clue on the stack. Dump memory for a few hundred bytes starting at the stack<br>
pointer.
</p>
<p>
<b>25</b> Steve $0028 bytes after the stack pointer, you notice a funny value: $4080BD0A.
</p>
<p>
KON That's an address in ROM, probably a return address. Disassemble around that<br>
address.
</p>
<p>
<b>20</b> Steve It's in LoadSeg, one instruction after a call to StripAddress. It looks like this:

<p>
BAL The JSR to Dispatcher+00C6 flushes the instruction cache. Because the 68030<br>
has separate instruction and data caches, LoadSeg needs to do that to make sure that the<br>
newly loaded data is eligible to make it into the cache. Next the subroutine at +007C<br>
gets the code resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the handle isn't locked, it's moved high and locked. Then we<br>
find the first jump table entry for the segment, and test to see if it's loaded by<br>
checking whether the first instruction is $4EF9 (a JMP.L). If it's not loaded, each<br>
entry for this segment is updated from the unloaded form (involving a call to LoadSeg)<br>
to the loaded form (involving a JMP.L). But it must have skipped this, because<br>
otherwise the PEA at +0052 would have overwritten the return address from the call<br>
to StripAddress, and that return address is still on the stack.
</p>
<p>
KON It skipped over the code to transform the jump table entries, so the segment must<br>
have already been loaded. But if the segment was loaded, the jump table wouldn't have<br>
any LoadSeg calls for that segment. Somehow LoadSeg was called for a segment that was<br>
already loaded. So your application must be calling LoadSeg manually!
</p>
<p>
<b>15</b> Steve Honest, I'm not calling LoadSeg manually. A search of my source code verifies<br>
this.
</p>
<p>
BAL The only other way for LoadSeg to get called is through the jump table. How does<br>
your reference-counting segment unloader work? Is it possible that a segment gets<br>
called by your reference-counting code while you're in the process of loading it?
</p>
<p>
<b>10</b> Steve It shouldn't be. The reference counting is done manually; we don't patch<br>
LoadSeg or anything nasty like that. At any rate, segment 44 isn't reference-counted.
</p>
<p>
KON Here's an idea: When LoadSeg was called to bring in segment 44, it called<br>
GetResource to bring the resource into memory. Assuming the code segment had been<br>
loaded in the past and later unloaded and purged, GetResource would have called<br>
ReallocHandle, which was short on memory and called your GrowZone hook. Your<br>
GrowZone function started freeing memory and then called another function in segment<br>
44, triggering a recursive call to LoadSeg.
</p>
<p>
BAL With enough memory free, segment 44 was loaded. Then the GrowZone function<br>
exited back to the ReallocHandle call, which succeeded, and segment 44 was loaded<br>
again when the GetResource call completed. When the original LoadSeg checked the state<br>
of the jump table, it was already kosher, so the test for $4EF9 fired and the return<br>
address from StripAddress didn't get overwritten.
</p>
<p>
KON That certainly explains the confused heap. The GZSaveHnd that was passed to the<br>
GrowZone function shouldn't be touched, but you called GetResource on it indirectly via<br>
LoadSeg. It also explains the skewed jump table entries: after allocating a memory<br>
block, ReallocHandle simply assigns the master pointer to point to that block, without<br>
preserving the handle state stored in the high byte of the master pointer. This<br>
effectively sets the handle state to 0, erasing the HLock call from the inner LoadSeg.<br>
Thus, when the outer LoadSeg called MoveHHi on the second copy of the segment, the<br>
lock bit in the master pointer -- which is shared by both blocks -- was clear. So<br>
when MoveHHi called CompactMem, the first copy of the segment was free to move (in<br>
this case, by $017C bytes). Finally, GetResource returned to the original LoadSeg,<br>
which set the lock bit again.
</p>
<p>
BAL Take another look at your link map. Are there any routines in segment 44 that<br>
could be called from your GrowZone hook?
</p>
<p>
<b>5</b> Steve That's funny. There are some routines in this segment that shouldn't be there<br>
-- in fact, they shouldn't be anywhere. They're supposed to be inline functions!
</p>
<p>
BAL The C++ compiler won't always copy a function inline, even if it's declared that<br>
way. This can happen if the function body is too complicated. Segment loading is a<br>
foreign concept that doesn't fit well into a C++ class hierarchy, and the MPW<br>
implementation has a few puzzlers.
</p>
<p>
KON Some of the calls to these "inline" functions were from segment 44, so they<br>
happened to be placed in that segment. Then, when the GrowZone hook tried to call one<br>
of the inline functions, it had to load segment 44 -- and the rest is history.
</p>
<p>
BAL C++ claims another victim.
</p>
<p>
Steve So how do I avoid this in the future? Put segment #pragmas around all my inline<br>
functions?
</p>
<p>
BAL That's a superstition believed by some people who should know better. It doesn't<br>
work.
</p>
<p>
KON What does work is what those Finder folks did. MPW CFront puts the uninlineable<br>
functions at the end of the file it's compiling. The Finder folks just end every file with<br>
"#pragma segment CFrontCruft," and all the unexpected functions wind up in one<br>
easy-to-manage segment.
</p>
<p>
Steve "Uninlineable" isn't a word.
</p>
<p>
BAL That's why it's called cruft. Incidentally, this technique also catches functions that<br>
the compiler has to synthesize entirely, such as constructors and destructors for<br>
classes where they're needed (to initialize the vtable, for example) but aren't declared<br>
explicitly. And by looking at the link map, you can see what the compiler is doing<br>
behind your back -- although you might be happier not knowing.
</p>
<p>
KON Nasty.
</p>
<p>
BAL Yeah.
