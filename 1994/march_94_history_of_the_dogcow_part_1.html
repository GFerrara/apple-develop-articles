<h2>HISTORY OF THE DOGCOW PART 1</h2>

<p>
I'm going to tell you a few things that have <i>never</i> been put in print before about the<br>
dogcow. If you don't know what or who the dogcow is, or you don't care for Apple<br>
cultural minutiae, you should just flip past this column.
</p>
<p>
This is only part 1 of the story, to be followed by more in a future issue of <i>develop</i> .<br>
We didn't want to hit you with it all at once, for fear of what the shock (or the<br>
boredom) might do. 
</p>
<p>
<b>HOW IT ALL BEGAN</b><br>
The dogcow was originally a character in the Cairo font that used to ship with the<br>
Macintosh; it was designed by Susan Kare. I had always been interested in this critter<br>
ever since I first saw it in the LaserWriter Page Setup Options dialog, sometime<br>
during my stint in Apple's Developer Technical Support (DTS) group in 1987. To me<br>
it showed perfection in human interface design. With one picture it was very easy to<br>
explain concepts like an inverted image or larger print area that otherwise would be<br>
nearly impossible to communicate. 
</p>
<p>
Interest became an obsession when one day I was talking to Scott ("Zz") Zimmerman<br>
about the dialog and suddenly thought, "Just what is that animal supposed to be,<br>
anyway?" Since Zz was the Printing Guy in DTS (now in the Newton group), and my<br>
favorite pastime was to bother him endlessly anyway, I started pressing him on<br>
whether the animal was a dog or a cow. 
</p>
<p>
In an act of desperation he said, "It's both, OK? It's called a 'dogcow.' Now will you get<br>
out of my office?" The date was October 15, 1987, and I consider this to be the first<br>
use of the term. It should be noted that since then a few people (including Ginger<br>
herself) have told me that actually the phrase was coined by Ginger Jernigan (ex-DTS,<br>
now ROM software) at a meeting of Apple's Print Shop sometime shortly before that,<br>
which very well could be the case. Nevertheless it was Zz who pressed it into common<br>
usage, and he certainly was the first person I ever heard use the term. 
</p>
<p>
Zz's ploy to get me out of his office was futile, however, because then I stood around<br>
and postulated that the dogcow's genes would have a radical effect on its behavior, and it<br>
must not bark or moo, but rather utter a combination like "Boo-woo!" or "Moof!"
</p>
<p>
We both thought it was funny enough that we decided to press it into everyday usage,<br>
and I started circulating the dogcow with "Moof!" on internal memos. The idea caught<br>
on, and at the 1988 Worldwide Developers Conference we gave away dogcow buttons in<br>
the debugging lab. Louella Pizzuti (ex-DTS, ex-<i>develop</i> editor, now citizen of the<br>
world) came up with the great idea of making the background Mountain Dew green.<br>
Response to the buttons was huge, and no one was smiling more than the DTS folks<br>
when John Sculley wore one for his keynote speech. It was a major-league coup.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE ORIGIN OF TECH NOTE #31</b><br>
Then things started to spin out of control. Various groups internally started picking up<br>
the dogcow logo and doing things that didn't seem, well, DTS-like. The final straw was<br>
when the dogcow pin appeared in a Microsoft advertisement. Mark Johnson (ex-DTS,<br>
now in Apple Europe) approached me and suggested that we throw down the gauntlet and<br>
write a Technical Note on the subject. I balked out of nothing more than sheer laziness.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Some time passed and we were getting ready to go with the April 1989 batch of Tech<br>
Notes when Mark approached me again, saying that he thought having an April Fool's<br>
edition describing the dogcow would be perfect. I said yes but then stalled and stalled,<br>
missing two deadlines, and I thought the Tech Note wasn't going to happen.
</p>
<p>
Mark marched in my office one day in March of 1989 at 11:30A.&nbsp;&nbsp;M.&nbsp;&nbsp;announcing that<br>
Tech Notes were shipping at noon and implied that my manliness was in question if I<br>
didn't get that Note in the batch. My macho instincts just couldn't allow that to happen,<br>
so Tech Note #31, "The Dogcow," was written in literally 40 minutes in one pass. I'd<br>
been thinking about it for quite some time, so I knew pretty much how it would go; I<br>
just sat down and typed it out. Given more time I definitely would have churned out<br>
something a bit more polished, and part of its quirkiness, I'm sure, is due to the time<br>
pressure I was under. 
</p>
<p>
One thing was certain: it had to be something original in concept. I've always had a deep<br>
disdain for people who rip off comedic stuff. You know, the same people who used to<br>
have to tell all their jokes with an English accent because of Monty Python are now<br>
those who say "<i>Not!&nbsp;&nbsp;</i> " behind phrases. Once is funny, but after a while it gets really<br>
old. I definitely wanted it out of the mainstream. 
</p>
<p>
For numbering I wanted to use <i>e</i> , but Mark pointed out that there had been confusion<br>
early on in the Tech Note numbering scheme and that a few numbers had been left out<br>
for various reasons. He showed me some conversations from the net that went on and on<br>
about Tech Note #31 and people's guesses as to why it was missing. (People were<br>
really, really out there with their guessing; anyone who's a believer in conspiracy<br>
theories would have enjoyed this blatant gibberish.) The number 31 had the right feel;<br>
it would blend into the regular batch better than<i>e</i> , and I've always had a soft spot for<br>
prime numbers, so we picked it. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Sports Illustrated</i> had run a great fake story about a Zen baseball pitcher sometime<br>
earlier and we borrowed the idea of having the words "April Fool's" spelled out within<br>
the article from them -- in our case using the first letter of every line of the poem at<br>
the closing. No one has ever mentioned this to me, so few people must have caught it. 
</p>
<p>
There's a picture of the wrong way to draw the dogcow that several people thought was<br>
a scanned image of Zz. Actually, completely independently of the Tech Note, I'd been<br>
using a program called Mac-a-Mug, designed to make mug shots, and came across a set<br>
of hair that looked frighteningly like Zz's. After fiddling around with the program a bit<br>
I was able to come up with a good rendition of Zz's head, and I shoved it into the Tech<br>
Note without his ever knowing about it. The expression (and color) of his face when he<br>
learned about the picture is a memory I'll always cherish. 
</p>
<p>
The Note also contains the expression "Aanal, Enacku Naiimadu, Kaanali!" People came<br>
up with very unusual anagrams or unusual explanations for what it meant, the best<br>
being that it was an obscure reference to a clip of<i>The Day the Earth Stood Still</i> that had<br>
been cut from the film. But the truth is that it's phoneticized Tamil that was supplied<br>
by Sriram Subramanian (Networking Guy, ex- DTS, ex-Taligent, now in Apple Japan)<br>
meaning "But I can't see the dogcow!"
</p>
<p>
Ironically, there's also a mistake in that the "correct" way to draw the dogcow is<br>
actually wrong. We ended up being so pressured for time in getting the Note out the<br>
door that we just jammed it into a weird PostScript file that ended up mutating the<br>
shape. Shortly after the release of that Note, Chris Derossi (ex-DTS, now at General<br>
Magic) convinced me that a better solution was to have the correct way to draw the<br>
dogcow be pixelated, to avoid these idiosyncracies in the future -- which is what's now<br>
done.
</p>
<p>
<b>NEXT TIME</b><br>
There will be more history of the dogcow in a future issue of<i>develop</i> . Have you ever<br>
wondered if you have the entire set of dogcow pins? Is that dogcow T-shirt of your<br>
cubemate's bootlegged? Is there any way things can get more meaningless? Some, but<br>
not all, of these questions will be answered the next time we have a little extra space to<br>
fill.

<b>MARK ("THE RED") HARLAN </b>started life in Rawlins, Wyoming, and has led about<br>
exactly the kind of life you'd expect as a result. He spends most of his time at Apple<br>
finding employees who were hired by Steve Jobs and asking them, "So how does it feel<br>
knowing that the way you changed the world is by putting Windows on all PCs?" *

<b>Tech Note #31 is not on this issue's CD </b> and hasn't been on the CD for quite<br>
some time now; it's no longer available. It used to be hidden in the Technical Notes<br>
Stack on the early versions of <i> develop</i> 's CD. It appeared on paper only once, as part of<br>
the monthly mailing to Apple Partners and Associates in April of 1989. The continued<br>
secrecy has a little bit to do with history and a lot to do with tradition.&nbsp;&nbsp;For more on<br>
the distribution of the&nbsp;&nbsp;Tech Note, stay tuned for History of the Dogcow: Part 2.*
