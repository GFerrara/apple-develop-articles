<h2>Macintosh Q &amp; A</h2>
<h1>Macintosh Developer Technical Support</h1>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> What operations cause QuickDraw GX to invalidate its shape caches? We want to</i><br>
<i>maximize drawing performance in our application, and it would be nice to know ahead</i><br>
<i>of time when caches will need to be rebuilt.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> As you might imagine, this topic is complex, but we'll try to explain the basics and<br>
give you some ideas about improving performance.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;There are several caches associated with a shape, since each object associated with the<br>
shape has a separate cache. (By the way, the caches are in the QuickDraw GX heap and<br>
can be seen using GraphicsBug.) Every time you call GXDrawShape, QuickDraw GX<br>
determines which caches need to be updated, updates them, and then draws the shape.<br>
So the first thing to know is that if you want GXDrawShape to execute as fast as<br>
possible (for instance, if you're drawing several shapes and want the time between<br>
successive GXDrawShape calls to be minimal), you should call GXCacheShape ahead of<br>
time to update the shape's caches, minimizing the work GXDrawShape needs to do.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;In general, any time you change information within a shape, you cause QuickDraw GX<br>
to invalidate at least one of the shape's caches. Layout shapes are exceptions to this<br>
rule, however. The cache associated with a layout shape will not be invalidated if all of<br>
the following conditions are met:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You're adding characters to the end of the layout shape.</li>
<li>There's a single run of text within the layout shape.</li>
<li>The shape remains on the same device.</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;If you're drawing non-hairline geometric shapes and want to get them on the screen as<br>
fast as possible, you can set the gxCacheShape attribute of the shape. With this<br>
attribute set, QuickDraw GX will preprocess all the required parts of a shape into<br>
compressed bitmaps. This means the shape is completely ready to be drawn when you<br>
call GXDrawShape: the bits are just blasted to the screen.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Any time you change a view port's clip or mapping, QuickDraw GX will update all of<br>
the caches for the shapes and child view ports associated with that view port. There<br>
isn't any speed advantage to setting the clip or mapping of a shape rather than the clip<br>
or mapping of the shape's view port; the same work has to happen in either case. Note,<br>
though, that if the view port contains other shapes or has child view ports, their<br>
caches will be invalidated, too. You should change the view port's mapping to move a<br>
shape only when you want all shapes within the view port to move the same amount.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I'm looking into the possibility of writing a QuickDraw GX printer driver that will</i><br>
<i>only print to a file, and I've run into a couple of stumbling blocks I hope you can help</i><br>
<i>with. First, is there a way to create a desktop printer from the Chooser without having</i><br>
<i>an actual printer attached or selecting a port? Can I get to the Chooser list so that I can</i><br>
<i>display some kind of dummy or ghost printer? The second issue has to do with the user</i><br>
<i>interface of the Print dialogs/panels. I would like to set the "Destination: File" radio</i><br>
<i>button and disable the "Destination: Printer" one for QuickDraw GX application</i><br>
<i>interfaces.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> There should be no problem creating a printer driver that only prints to a file. And<br>
yes, users will be able to create a desktop printer from such a driver. You can access<br>
the Chooser list:&nbsp;&nbsp;for an example of this, look at the source code file Chooser.c from any<br>
of the QuickDraw GX printer driver samples. You can do whatever you want within the<br>
Chooser to handle and display lists of available printers for the currently selected<br>
printer driver. You'll also need to modify the 'comm' resource to make sure that the<br>
Chooser does the right thing. You&nbsp;&nbsp;should be able to put a "nops" 'comm' resource<br>
reference into the 'look' resource.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;You can disable any item in the Print dialog by overriding the GXJobPrintDialog<br>
message and, in your override, getting the destination tag for the appropriate item and<br>
locking it. This will make the item appear disabled in the dialog. PrintingMgr.h<br>
contains all the tags you can lock. You should be sure to set up the item to be<br>
gxVolatileOutputDriverCategory so that your settings go away if the user switches<br>
drivers in the pop-up menu; you can simply OR this with collectionLockMask when<br>
you set the item's attributes.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> The documentation seems a bit thin on what resource type/ID is needed for ColorSync</i><br>
<i>profiles in QuickDraw GX printer drivers. Is the appropriate type 'prof' or 'cmat'?</i><br>
<i>Will QuickDraw GX automatically use one if I stick it in my driver, or do I also have to</i><br>
<i>override the various profile messages?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> All you need to do is include a 'cmat' resource with ID gxColorMatchingDataID and<br>
specify it in your 'rdip' resource. However, you should also override<br>
GXFindFormatProfile so that inquiring applications can ask you what the format's<br>
profile will be. Additionally, you should override the GXImagePage message if you want<br>
to provide different profiles on a page-by-page basis.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I'm working on QuickDraw GX printer drivers. Can you give me some information on</i><br>
<i>what must be done to support PrGeneral?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> PrGeneral support within your QuickDraw GX printer driver is automatic. The<br>
printing system will automatically maintain the appropriate information within the<br>
QuickDraw GX print record. The only exception to this automatic support is the SetRsl<br>
opcode: if you don't want QuickDraw GX to use the default gxReslType resource when<br>
the SetRsl opcode is used, you need to define a gxReslType resource of your own that<br>
reflects the capabilities of your printer.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Our application generates its own custom PostScript TM code when printing to</i><br>
<i>PostScript printers. We'd like to support QuickDraw GX-style printing and still be</i><br>
<i>able to continue generating our own custom PostScript code to send directly to the</i><br>
<i>printer. What's the best way to handle this? I've tried generating empty shapes with</i><br>
<i>custom PostScript code attached as a tag (using synonyms), but the LaserWriter</i><br>
<i>QuickDraw GX driver emits its own "wrapper" code around our custom PostScript</i><br>
<i>code, which could alter the printer's graphics state. Are there any other methods to</i><br>
<i>achieve this without the possible side effects?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> You're actually very close to sending PostScript code correctly through the<br>
QuickDraw GX printing system without the side effects. As you already know, after a<br>
shape with 'post' tags has been sent to a PostScript printer, QuickDraw GX performs a<br>
PostScript restore. There's no way to prevent this from happening. However, only<br>
shape objects cause this behavior; QuickDraw GX will not perform a PostScript<br>
restore for any other object besides a shape.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The fastest and best method for sending PostScript code is to attach the code with tags<br>
(using synonyms) to only one empty shape. You can attach as many tags as are<br>
required. We recommend that the tags contain 12K of PostScript data each, for optimal<br>
performance. If you're sending PostScript code down to replace the clip or ink or some<br>
other object besides a shape, just attach a 'post' tag to the object your PostScript code<br>
describes; in this case a restore will not occur.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> How should I download fonts to a PostScript printer under QuickDraw GX? I'm</i><br>
<i>sending a direct stream of custom PostScript code, but I don't expect the driver to be</i><br>
<i>able to deduce which fonts need to be included. I've read about the PostScript control</i><br>
<i>tag that can be attached to a shape, and I know the structure&nbsp;&nbsp;for the tag contains font</i><br>
<i>information, but the documentation about this tag is sketchy. Can you provide more</i><br>
<i>details?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;Related to this question, what's the best way to cause fonts to be downloaded under the</i><br>
<i>current Printing Manager? We're using the "draw a single character off the page in</i><br>
<i>the proper font" trick. I understand this practice is frowned on. Is there an approved</i><br>
<i>way to do this short of intermixing QuickDraw and PostScript code in PicComments?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Our thinking has changed regarding the use of the PostScript control tag for<br>
downloading a font. If you want to download a font within your PostScript stream, you<br>
should call GXFlattenFont and pass the font within your 'post' tag. The GX PostScript<br>
engine will unflatten the font and download it when it finds it attached to your 'post'<br>
tag.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The method you're using (drawing a character off the page) is completely supported<br>
under QuickDraw GX. It was the recommended method for a long time. However, the<br>
current recommendation is to use DrawText and pass in text that contains all the<br>
glyphs you want to use. The reason this approach is better for QuickDraw GX is that<br>
only the required information is downloaded, thereby saving memory on the printer.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Do I need to override the GXFreeBuffer message in my QuickDraw GX printer driver</i><br>
<i>if I perform a total override of the GXDumpBuffer message? If I do need to override</i><br>
<i>GXFreeBuffer, what do I do with the buffer? Should I dispose of it with DisposePtr?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> The documentation is a little confusing about the purpose of the GXFreeBuffer<br>
message. GXFreeBuffer is sent to ensure that the indicated buffer has been processed<br>
and is now available for more data; it doesn't actually dispose of a buffer. The only time<br>
you need to override GXFreeBuffer is if you're doing custom I/O (the customIO flag is<br>
set in your 'iobm' resource). The default implementation of GXFreeBuffer will work<br>
correctly for QuickDraw GX's default buffering mechanism.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;GXFreeBuffer allows you to start asynchronous I/O in GXDumpBuffer;&nbsp;&nbsp;then other<br>
buffering routines can be sure that operations on a buffer are completed before they<br>
reuse the buffer (or dispose of it). If you're overriding GXFreeBuffer, you should just<br>
hang out in your override until I/O has completed for the buffer passed, and then<br>
return. If you're doing synchronous I/O, just return immediately, since all I/O must<br>
have completed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> When I control the start of a QuickTime movie from within my application, the</i><br>
<i>movie controller doesn't get updated properly. I'm calling StartMovie to begin the</i><br>
<i>movie as soon as it becomes visible, and I'm updating the movie controller like this:</i>
</p>
<pre> theResult := MCDoAction(tmpMovie.fController, mcActionPlay,
     @curRate);</pre>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;However, this doesn't seem to work. What am I doing wrong?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> The MCDoAction call with mcActionPlay doesn't take a pointer to the data in the last<br>
parameter; it takes the data itself. But since the prototype specifies type (void *), to<br>
make the compiler happy it must be cast to a pointer. Many people have fallen into this<br>
trap.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The recommended method to start a movie when you're using the standard movie<br>
controller component is as follows:
</p>
<pre>// Play normal speed forward, taking into account the possibility
// of a movie with a nonstandard PreferredRate.
Fixed rate = GetMoviePreferredRate(MyMovie);
MCDoAction(MyMovieController, mcActionPlay, (void *)rate);</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do need to use StartMovie, the correct way to cause the movie controller to<br>
update is to call MCMovieChanged.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> We're using the Communications Toolbox in our application and have noticed some</i><br>
<i>strange behavior. Specifically, when a tool is being used, the tool's resource fork is </i><br>
<i>placed not at the top of the resource chain, but behind the System and application</i><br>
<i>resource forks. As a result, we're having trouble with tools that use STR# resources</i><br>
<i>that conflict with those in our application. This results in bad configuration strings or</i><br>
<i>configuration dialogs with the wrong text. I can easily work around this by changing</i><br>
<i>the resource IDs in my application, but this doesn't solve the problem in the long run.</i><br>
<i>Any advice?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> What you're seeing is a part of the "pathology" of the Communications Toolbox and its<br>
tools. Both do a less than perfect job of looking in the correct resource map for string<br>
resources. The result is what you're currently seeing: application strings end up being<br>
placed where tool strings are expected.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;There are a couple of workarounds. The first you've cited, which is to make sure that<br>
none of your application's resource ID numbers conflict with the CTB tool's ID<br>
numbers. However, as you also noted, this can be a problem when you're using several<br>
CTB tools, and may not work if the user happens to select a tool that has a conflicting<br>
ID.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The better way to work around the problem is to save a reference to the current<br>
resource file and then set the resource file to the System file. After completing a call<br>
to CMChoose or CMGetConfig, you can reset the resource file to the one you started<br>
with. Here's how to do this:
</p>
<pre>short   oldResFile;
Point   dlogBoxPt;
Ptr     myConfigString;

/* First save the current resource file. */
oldResFile = CurResFile();
/* Now set the resource file to the System file. */
UseResFile(0);
/* Next call CMChoose to configure your connection tool. */
myErr = CMChoose(&amp;myConnectionHdl, dlogBoxPt, nil);
/* Now call CMGetConfig to get the configuration string from the
    connection tool. */
myConfigString = CMGetConfig(myConnectionHdl);
/* And finally, restore the old resource file. */
UseResFile(oldResFile);</pre>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> What is the Human Interface suggestion for removing a digital signature from a</i><br>
<i>signed document? I see how to add and how to verify, but I can't find any suggestions</i><br>
<i>for removing signatures.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Here's the relevant paragraph from the <i> AOCE Human Interface Guidelines </i> <br>
document, which can be found on AppleLink (search the AOCE Talk folder):
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Signatures may also be deleted by users. To accomplish this, the user should select the<br>
signature by clicking on its icon and choosing Clear from the application's Edit menu.<br>
Selecting the signature icon and pressing the delete key is a desirable alternative. Note<br>
that signatures must not be cut, copied, or pasted.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;To actually remove a signature, just remove the 'dsig' resource from the file. Note<br>
that signed files may have the Finder "locked" bit set. If you remove the signature, you<br>
should also clear this bit.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I launch my application by dragging files onto its icon. It then opens the files,</i><br>
<i>performs some quick operation, and quits. I can put '****' and 'fold' resources in</i><br>
<i>FREFs to let users drag any file or folder onto the application icon. But when a user</i><br>
<i>drags an AOCE catalog (or anything inside the catalog) onto the icon, the Finder won't</i><br>
<i>let the user drop it onto my application. What do I need to do to my application to let</i><br>
<i>users drop-launch it with AOCE catalogs (or their contents)? I know it's possible: the</i><br>
<i>"Find in Catalog" application will drop-launch if a user dragged to it from a catalog.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> If you look, you'll see that "Find in Catalog" is a Catalogs Extension template. It's not<br>
an application program; it actually executes as part of the Finder. Unfortunately, you<br>
can't do what you want to with an application. You&nbsp;&nbsp;might want to look at the Catalog<br>
Service Access Modules chapter in <i> Inside Macintosh: AOCE Service Access Modules</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;for<br>
more information on the Catalogs Extension.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> When users launch my utility application by double-clicking, I present a Standard</i><br>
<i>File dialog that lets them choose a file to operate on. I'd like them to be able to browse</i><br>
<i>AOCE catalogs as well as HFS files, but catalogs don't show up in the Standard File</i><br>
<i>dialog. I could use another dialog for browsing AOCE catalogs, but why use two different</i><br>
<i>interfaces for the same action (from the user's point of view, that is; the user just</i><br>
<i>wants to specify an object, wherever it may be)? Is there a way to get catalogs to show</i><br>
<i>up in the Standard File dialog? Is there any way to browse the file system and the AOCE</i><br>
<i>catalog system in the same dialog? If the answer is no, is there an analog to Standard</i><br>
<i>File for AOCE catalogs?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> You can't browse HFS files and AOCE catalogs in the same dialog, since they're two<br>
different file systems. To let the user browse the AOCE catalog system, you need to use<br>
the AOCE Standard Catalog Package Reference routines, which are documented in <i> Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh: AOCE Application Interfaces</i> . There is a routine that's analogous to<br>
StandardGetFile. The AOCE Software Developer's Kit (available through APDA) includes<br>
sample code that shows how to browse AOCE catalogs.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I'm writing an application that will watch a user-specified folder and operate on</i><br>
<i>files or folders that are dropped into it. I need to perform operations on every item in</i><br>
<i>the folder and its subfolders. What will happen if I begin to walk through a new folder</i><br>
<i>with PBGetCatInfo while the Finder is still copying files into the subfolder structure?</i><br>
<i>Can I guarantee that I'll detect all the files?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> There's no way to find out directly when the Finder is done copying items into the<br>
folder, but there is a strategy we can recommend. First, though, you should know that<br>
the recommended way to determine whether items have been added to a folder is to<br>
watch its modification date. So how can you know when all the files have arrived? The<br>
recommended strategy is to poll the parent folder's modification date every few seconds<br>
after you first detect a change, and keep polling until you have a reasonably long<br>
interval during which there's no change in the date (30 seconds is probably about<br>
right). This means, of course, that there's a delay before you act on files dropped into<br>
the folder, but as the Print Monitor shows us, this delay is probably reasonable to the<br>
user.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;One more possible gotcha you should know about: to tell whether it's safe to work with<br>
a particular file, it's not enough just to make sure the file isn't open; you need to check<br>
its length. If a file is closed (that is, not busy) but has no length in either its resource<br>
or data fork, you caught the Finder at an uncomfortable time, after it created the file<br>
but before it opened it. So to know if you can operate on a file the Finder might be<br>
copying, you must determine two things: it's not already open, and it has length in its<br>
resource or data fork.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Our application uses the Icon Utilities interface, and we want to verify that these</i><br>
<i>features are present before we use them. We've been unable to do this successfully.</i><br>
<i>The Macintosh Technical Note "Drawing Icons the System 7 Way" (QuickDraw 18)</i><br>
<i>doesn't say how to do this, but Inside Macintosh: More Macintosh Toolbox recommends</i><br>
<i>using Gestalt with the gestaltIconUtilities selector. When we try this, Gestalt returns</i><br>
<i>an error of -5551 (undefined selector). What are we doing wrong?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> There isn't a Gestalt selector for the Icon Utilities; <i> Inside Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;and the header<br>
files are wrong. Even if we were to correct that situation tomorrow (or in the next<br>
system software release), it wouldn't help, since the Icon Utilities are available on<br>
systems where the Gestalt selector isn't. The solution is to use the TrapAvailable<br>
function to see if the _IconDispatch A- trap is available. You can find the source code<br>
for TrapAvailable in <i> Inside Macintosh </i> Volume VI on page&nbsp;&nbsp;3-8, or in <i>Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh: Overview</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;on page 180.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I have a System 7 application that the user can drag files, disks, or folders to. How</i><br>
<i>can I determine from the Apple event information which type of item (file, disk, or</i><br>
<i>folder) has been dragged to the application icon?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> When the user drags a file, disk, or folder to an application icon, the Finder&nbsp;&nbsp;uses the<br>
Process Manager to open the application and then sends it an Open Document ('odoc')<br>
event containing a list of alias records for each object dropped. When your application<br>
receives the event, it needs to open each of&nbsp;&nbsp;the objects specified in the event by getting<br>
each alias record from the list and coercing the data for that record to an FSSpec. Once<br>
you have the FSSpec, you can check its parID to determine whether the directory ID is<br>
fsRtParID, indicating that you're looking at a volume. If the parID is anything other<br>
than fsRtParID, use PBGetCatInfo to determine if you have a file or a folder. Here's the<br>
code:
</p>
<pre>enum {kItsAVolume = 1, kItsAFolder, kItsAFile};
pascal OSErr GetSpecType(FSSpec *myFSS)
{
    CInfoPBRec  pb;
    OSErr           myErr;
    short           objType = 0;
   
    if ((myFSS-&gt;parID) == fsRtParID)
        objType = kItsAVolume;
    else {
        pb.hFileInfo.ioNamePtr = (StringPtr) *(myFSS).name;
        pb.hFileInfo.ioVRefNum = *(myFSS).vRefNum;
        pb.hFileInfo.ioDirID = *(myFSS).parID;
        pb.hFileInfo.ioFDirIndex = 0;
        myErr = PBGetCatInfoSync(&amp;pb);
        if (myErr == noErr) {
            /* Check to see if bit 0x10 of ioFlAttrib is set; if it
                is, we've got a directory */
            if ((pb.hFileInfo.ioFlAttrib &amp; 0x10) != 0)
                objType = kItsAFolder;
            else
                objType = kItsAFile;
        }
    }
    return (objType);
}</pre>

<b>Q</b><i> I'm trying to implement "the perfect component." The goals for this component are</i><br>
<i>fast dispatching, delegatable, able to rely on delegates, ready for everything, and</i><br>
<i>surprised&nbsp;&nbsp;by nothing. I've been using </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;develop<i> Issues 12 and 14 and Inside Macintosh:</i><br>
<i>More Macintosh Toolbox to guide me, but I still have a question that wasn't addressed in</i><br>
<i>those references.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;I'm using the Fast Dispatch method to dispatch my component's calls. I've figured out</i><br>
<i>how to repair the stack after getting an unsupported routine selector code, but I can't</i><br>
<i>figure out how to delegate a call. I think I'm recovering the stack correctly, but all the</i><br>
<i>documentation I've read doesn't even hint at this sort of functionality. I was thinking</i><br>
<i>that I could use DelegateComponentCall after creating a ComponentParameters record,</i><br>
<i>or I could calculate the size of the parameters and attempt to set up the stack for a</i><br>
<i>ComponentCallNow call. However, neither of these is a good solution -- they both take</i><br>
<i>too many instructions to implement and obviate the advantages of fast dispatching. Is</i><br>
<i>there such a thing as a DelegateFastComponentCall that I haven't heard of?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Try the following to delegate a component call:
</p>
<pre>move.l  d0, -(sp)       ; push d0 onto stack
PUSHDELEGATEGUY         ; macro to push component instance
move.q  #-2,d0
dc.w        $a82a</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;What apparently happened is that the engineers realized how difficult it was to call<br>
DelegateComponentCall when the stack was screwed up. So they created a "special"<br>
delegate call. As you can see, the selector is -2. This is supposed to be documented<br>
somewhere in the Component Manager documentation, but was inadvertently left out.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Why aren't my components getting register calls? I've set the appropriate flag. I'm</i><br>
<i>registering the component from my application.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Your component won't get called to register at all since it's being registered by an<br>
application. If you removed your component and placed it in the Extensions folder so<br>
that it was registered at system startup, it would receive a register call. The reason<br>
for this is that registration of components happens only when the Component Manager<br>
is first loaded at system startup. After system startup, components can be registered<br>
by applications, but the register routine will not be called.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I heard that the new Apple digital camera will introduce a graphics format called</i><br>
<i>QuickTake. Is this truly a new format or are these just QuickTime compressed PICTs?</i><br>
<i>If it's a new format, where can I find documentation on it?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> QuickTake stores its pictures as compressed PICT files. There's a new CODEC that's<br>
necessary to decompress the images, but no new file type. The QuickTake 100 Digital<br>
Camera Developer Note contains extensive information about talking to the camera<br>
from both Macintosh and Windows machines. It also documents the picture formats.<br>
The QuickTake Camera Software Development Kit is available from APDA.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The QuickTake application that comes with the camera can save the pictures in a<br>
variety of formats, including PICT (with or without various compressions) and TIFF.<br>
There's also a control panel that allows the user to mount the camera as a read-only<br>
serial RAM disk (similar to MountImage), so your application can directly download<br>
the information from the camera's memory.

<i>&nbsp;But the action never gets called! I don't have to explicitly refer to the 'inaa' anywhere,</i><br>
<i>do I? I checked that the resources were copied into the file correctly and had the right</i><br>
<i>IDs. What am I doing wrong?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Your action atom is fine. The only mistake you've made is not tying your 'inaa' to a<br>
package ('inpk'). You have to add to your 'inaa' a reference to an active 'inpk'. Once you<br>
do that, it works great. (We had trouble with this one until we found a cool diagram on<br>
page 8 of the Installer documentation that shows how the script resources interrelate;<br>
that diagram is your friend, and seems to encapsulate quite a bit of critical<br>
information.)

<b>Q</b><i> We're planning a zone name change for the zone that contains some of our</i><br>
<i>PowerShare servers. Will this require any action on the part of the administrators of</i><br>
<i>the various servers beyond informing users of the change?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> It depends on whether you're changing the zone names of some or all of the servers.<br>
If you're changing the names of only some servers, it's entirely possible that you don't<br>
have to notify anybody, depending on how you've replicated your folders. For a while<br>
the new servers won't be contacted by any clients since all clients will try to address<br>
them at their old location, but eventually all servers will again start receiving<br>
requests from clients.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;If you're changing the zone names of all the servers, the client software won't<br>
recognize that the zone names have changed, so you'll have to throw away your key<br>
chain and add it again after the zone names have changed. The PowerShare servers will<br>
eventually recover and rediscover all the other servers. We recommend that you bring<br>
up the Master Pathfinder first after changing its zone name and then bring up all the<br>
other servers. Once all the servers are up, it should take a few hours at most for<br>
everything to settle down again and for the system to be purring.

<b>Q</b><i> The function SMPEnumerateBlocks takes a buffer that returns information about the</i><br>
<i>blocks in a letter. The documentation (Inside Macintosh: AOCE Application Interfaces,</i><br>
<i>page 3-87) says that the buffer contains "a count byte indicating the number of blocks</i><br>
<i>in the letter, followed by a block information structure for each block." I can't find</i><br>
<i>anything that tells me what a "block information structure" is.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;It looks to me as if it actually returns the count of blocks in a short, not a byte. Is this</i><br>
<i>the total number of blocks, or the number of blocks returned by the call? If I have to</i><br>
<i>call the function again to get information that didn't fit in the buffer, do I get another</i><br>
<i>count followed by more block information structures, or do I just get an array with</i><br>
<i>more block information structures without the count (short)?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;The block information structure seems to be 16 bytes long, starting with an</i><br>
<i>OCECreatorType structure. Is this always correct, and what is the other information?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> This is somewhat confusing. The "block information structure" referred to here is<br>
the MailBlockInfo structure defined in the OCEMail.h header file:
</p>
<pre> struct MailBlockInfo {
    OCECreatorType  blockType;
    unsigned long   offset;
    unsigned long   blockLength;
};</pre>
<p>
And yes, the count byte returned in the buffer you provide is actually a short (the<br>
documentation is wrong). This value is placed right in front of the first MailBlockInfo<br>
structure each time you make the call. The count indicates the number of blocks that<br>
were put in your buffer for this particular call (not the total), which of course<br>
depends on the size of the buffer you pass; it fits in as many as it can. Check the "more"<br>
parameter to see if your buffer was too small to hold all the blocks, and check the<br>
nextIndex parameter for the sequence number of the next item to be returned.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I found what I think is a problem with the TEGetOffset routine: when it returns, a</i><br>
<i>28-byte handle has been locked for single-styled text. I believe it's a style handle that</i><br>
<i>gets locked. This seems to be an intermittent bug, occurring only about half the time.</i><br>
<i>Is there a workaround? Is it safe to just unlock the style handle after calling</i><br>
<i>TEGetOffset?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> It's a bug all right, and it is the style handle that's getting locked. Here's a<br>
workaround:
</p>
<pre>static short MyTEGetOffset(Point pt, TEHandle th)
{
    TEStyleHandle   sh;
    short               theResult;
    char                saveState;

    if (th == 0L)
        return;
    sh = GetStyleHandle(th);
    saveState = HGetState(sh);
    theResult = TEGetOffset(pt,th);
    HSetState(sh, saveState);
    return theResult;
}</pre>

<b>Q</b><i> I have a question about the Japanese art of bonsai (colloquially known as stunting</i><br>
<i>trees): What happens if you bonsai a fruit tree? Does the fruit come out dwarfed as</i><br>
<i>well? Or does the tiny tree produce full-size fruit?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> This was a difficult one to find an answer to. It seems to depend on many factors, not<br>
the least of which is the kind of fruit tree you're talking about. One person we talked to<br>
said he once saw a bonsai lemon tree nine inches tall, with a single, full-size lemon<br>
hanging from a branch. (Actually, the lemon didn't hang; it would have broken the poor<br>
tree. Instead it rested on a small platform built especially for that purpose.) But there<br>
were also reports of a stunted crabapple tree that produced apples the size of peas. Go<br>
figure.
