<h2>Newton Q &amp; A: Ask the Llama</h2>
<h1>Newton Developer Techical Support</h1>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Here's something that's been puzzling me a bit: I want to pop up something like a</i><br>
<i>copyright message for ten seconds when my application starts up. So I drew up a layout</i><br>
<i>called Presents with a protoFloater containing all the necessary text. In my main</i><br>
<i>layout is a link to Presents called presentsLink. The following is the viewShowScript</i><br>
<i>for the topmost view in my application:</i>
</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<pre>func()
begin
    presentsLink:open();
    AddDelayedAction(presentsLink:close(), nil, 10000)
end</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;This says to me: open the linked view, wait ten seconds, and close it. And that's exactly</i><br>
<i>what it does, except that after the view is closed, there's an exception. What am I doing</i><br>
<i>wrong and how do I fix it?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The short answer is that the second argument to the AddDelayedAction function is of<br>
the wrong type. This argument is supposed to be an array of parameters to be passed to<br>
the delayed function, and nil is not an array. The proper syntax for no arguments is&nbsp;&nbsp;[]<br>
instead of nil.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;But there's more: Although the closure you supplied in the first argument works in<br>
this case, you should get out of the habit of using that type of function call for delayed<br>
or deferred actions. You're better off providing a full closure and sending in the view<br>
you want closed, as in this:
</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<pre>func()
begin
    // Define a closure to use in the delayed action.
    local myClose := func(whichView)
          whichView:Close();

    presentsLink:Open();
    AddDelayedAction(myClose, [presentsLink], 10000);
end</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;Unfortunately, things do not end there. You also need to make sure that the myClose<br>
function is in internal RAM. The best way to do this is to use DefConst to define the<br>
function:
</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<pre>// In your ProjectData file:
DefConst('kDelayedClose, func(whichView) whichView:Close());

// This changes the function above:
func()
begin
    presentsLink:Open();
    AddDelayedAction(EnsureInternal(kDelayedClose),
          [presentsLink], 10000);
end</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;However, there is an easier solution. Instead of doing a delayed action you can use the<br>
view idle mechanism to do what you want. All you need to do is add a viewIdleScript and<br>
viewIdleFrequency to the presentsLink top-level view. The viewIdleScript simply<br>
sends a Close message. The viewIdleFrequency is set to the desired delay (10000 in<br>
this case).
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The really short answer is that you can just use protoGlance. This proto has the<br>
show-and- disappear behavior built in. You can set the viewIdleFrequency to 10000<br>
to get the behavior you want.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I have an alphabetically sorted list of items in a protoTable and I want to use</i><br>
<i>protoa2z to quickly move through the table (like the cardfile overview). How do I do</i><br>
<i>it?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The first thing you need to do is find the index in the protoTable of the correct item<br>
(that is, find the right item in the def.tabValues array of the protoTable). How you do<br>
this will depend on what type of data you're representing. Then you can figure out how<br>
high each item in the protoTable is, set the VOrg slot of the table to the correct line,<br>
and force the protoTable to redraw. You probably want to make sure that you don't<br>
scroll off the bottom of the table. Below is a method you can add to your protoTable that<br>
will do what you want. You can then send the message from your a2zChanged method<br>
(make sure you send the message to the protoTable).
</p>
<pre>func(index)
begin
    // Figure out the height of an item in the table.
    local childHeight := if def.tabProtos.viewFont exists then
          fontHeight(def.tabProtos.viewFont)
    else
          fontHeight(viewFont);

    // Make sure that the table will not scroll off the end
    // by calculating the index of the bottommost item that
    // will be displayed.
    local largestIndex := def.tabDown - ((:LocalBox().bottom -
          :LocalBox().top) DIV childHeight) - 1;

    // Use the bottommost item (largestIndex) to make sure
    // the table has no empty space on the bottom.
    vOrg := MIN(index, largestIndex);

    // Now force the table to redraw.
    :RedoChildren();
end</pre>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I would like to use the protoa2z sample code in my application, but I can't figure out</i><br>
<i>how to set the highlighted letter when the user scrolls through my data.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>It's easy once you realize that protoa2z is based on a protoPictIndexer. All you have<br>
to do is a SetValue of the currIndex slot to the correct index. This will change the<br>
highlighting of the protoa2z.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Note that using SetValue will not call the IndexClickScript, but this is probably what<br>
you want. If you do want it to be called, you'll have to manually unhighlight the current<br>
selection, set the currIndex slot, and then highlight the new item. The appropriate code<br>
would be
</p>
<pre>a2z:Unhilite();
a2z.currIndex := newIndex;
a2z:Hiliter(newIndex);</pre>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> What is your quest?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>To answer the questions of those who develop for Newton.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I tried to use a protoPictRadioButton in my application but the highlight rectangle</i><br>
<i>isn't the right size. I know that I need to write some code to draw the correct-sized</i><br>
<i>highlight, but where do I hook it in?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Minimally you need to override the viewDrawScript of the protoPictRadioButton.<br>
You may also want to change the viewFormat since it defaults to a thick<br>
rounded-rectangle border. Assuming that you wanted some sort of rectangle highlight<br>
around the selected button, you could use the following viewDrawScript:
</p>
<pre>func()
begin
    // If the button is selected, highlight it.
    if viewValue then
    begin
    // Get the bounds of the protoPictRadioButton.
    local b := :LocalBox();

    // Inset the bounds.
    b.top := b.top + 2;
    b.left := b.left + 2;
    b.bottom := b.bottom - 2;
    b.right := b.right - 2;

    // Now draw a rectangle.
    :DrawShape(MakeRect(b.left, b.top, b.right, b.bottom), nil);
    end;
end</pre>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> What is the AutoClose checkbox in the Newton Toolkit for? Why should I use it?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The AutoClose flag causes all other AutoClose applications to be closed when your<br>
application is clicked. The effect is that only one "auto-close" application can be open<br>
at one time. You should <i>always</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;make your application auto-close,&nbsp;&nbsp;to help conserve<br>
memory and other resources, unless it's providing special functionality to other<br>
applications (like the built-in Calculator or Styles application).
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> How do I create my own class of binary object?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>To get a binary object of your own class, you first need to create a binary object,<br>
then change its class to your own. The easiest way to do this is to create a string that's<br>
the same length as your intended binary object and then change (coerce) the class of<br>
this new object to your own class. You can use the string class as your basic binary<br>
object.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Suppose you wanted to have a binary class called CharID for an ID consisting of four<br>
ASCII characters. You could write a NewID function in your ProjectData file that would<br>
create the object and optionally initialize it, like this:
</p>
<pre>// Define a constant for a default CharID object. This constant
// can be cloned at run time. kDefaultCharIDObj will be a CharID
// object with 4 bytes that are set to 0x00.
DefConst('kDefaultCharIDOBj, SetClass(SetLength("", 4),
         'CharID));

// CharString is a string of 4 characters or nil.
NewCharID := func(CharString)
begin
    // Create a binary object of the correct length.
    local newObj := Clone(kDefaultCharIDObj);

    // Optionally initialize it.
    if CharString then
    for i := 0 to 3 do
          StuffChar(newObj, i, CharString[i]);

    // Return the new object.
    newObj;
end;</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;To see this code in action, you can type it into the Inspector window in the Newton<br>
Toolkit and evaluate it. Note that you cannot use DefConst in the Inspector since it's a<br>
compile-time function. Just substitute the second argument in the DefConst function<br>
for kDefaultCharIDObj in the function to evaluate it. Then you can try things like this:<br>
<i><code>x := :NewCharID(nil);</code></i><br>
<code>#440DD01 &lt;CharID, length 4&gt;</code><br>
<i><code> ExtractChar(x, 2);</code></i><br>
<code>&nbsp;#6 $\00</code><br>
<i><code> x := NewCharID("abcd");</code></i><br>
<code>&nbsp;#4410FC9 &lt;CharID, length 4&gt;</code><br>
<i><code> ExtractChar(x, 2);</code></i><br>
<code>&nbsp;#636 $c</code><br>
<i><code> ExtractByte(x, 2);</code></i><br>
<code>&nbsp;#18C 99</code>
</p>

<b>Q</b><i> What is your favorite color?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Llama fur beige.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> In my application I have a clPictureView that can display a variable number of</i><br>
<i>pictures. Right now I create a bunch of picture slots in my application and then make</i><br>
<i>another slot at run time that is an array of those items. There must be an easier way.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>You're right; there is an easier way. You can use the GetPictAsBits function in your<br>
ProjectData file to read in the bitmaps. Note that you'll first have to open the resource<br>
file that contains the pictures.
</p>
<pre>// Open the resource file that contains the pictures.
// Assumes the file "Pictures" exists in the project folder.
r := OpenResFileX("Pictures");

// Get an array of pictures.
myPictures := [
    GetPictAsBits("TARDIS", nil),
    GetPictAsBits("Planet", nil)
];

// Now close the resource file.
CloseResFileX(r);</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;Once you have the myPictures array, you can create a slot of type Evaluate and just<br>
type "myPictures" in the editor for the slot. Then you can use SetValue to set the icon<br>
slot of the clPicture view to one of the elements of the array.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> How do I put my own default person in the fax information slip?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>You can set up a default person in your SetupRoutingSlip method, which is called<br>
before the fax slip is shown. The argument to that method is used to set up the<br>
particular routing slip. In the case of a fax slip, there's a slot called "alternatives"<br>
which is an array of cardfile entries for the possible people to fax to. If there's just<br>
one entry, that's the person. The fax number will be set from the cardfile entry. So<br>
your SetupRoutingSlip method would look like this:
</p>
<pre>func(fields)
begin
    // Check for a fax.
    if fields.category = 'faxSlip then
    fields.alternatives := SmartCFQuery("Llama");
    // Do other stuff here, like put a title for the out box.
end</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;Note that the fields.category is set to the same value you set in the routeSlip slot of a<br>
frame in your application's entry in the global routing frame. The SmartCFQuery<br>
function returns an array of cardfile entries that have strings starting with the string<br>
passed in.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I noticed that every soup entry has a _uniqueID slot. Just how unique is it?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The _uniqueID slot is only unique within that soup on that particular store. The ID<br>
will never be reused in that soup on that store. However, it's not necessarily unique<br>
across stores (say, RAM and a PCMCIA card).
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> What is the ground velocity of an unladen llama climbing a 5% grade?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>What do you mean -- Mexican or Venezuelan?
