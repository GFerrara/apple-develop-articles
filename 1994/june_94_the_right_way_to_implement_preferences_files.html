<p>
<i>Many Macintosh applications use preferences files to keep track of user preferences.</i><br>
<i>This article describes the characteristics of a well implemented preferences file and</i><br>
<i>introduces a library that manages this work for you.</i>
</p>
<p>
Preferences files have become a standard feature of most Macintosh applications. With<br>
these files being so commonplace, it's timely to investigate how to implement them<br>
properly. We'll first take a look at what constitutes a well implemented preferences<br>
file; then we'll inspect a library API that provides a simple means of creating and<br>
interacting with preferences files. On this issue's CD you'll find source code for a<br>
standard preferences library and a test application that illustrates how to use the<br>
library. This library is written with version 6.0.1 of Symantec's THINK C for<br>
Macintosh using the universal interface files (which can also be found on the CD). 
</p>
<p>
Before we begin, let's take a look at when and when not to create a preferences file. A<br>
preferences file needs to be created only when the user has altered the default<br>
configuration of the application. Upon being launched for the first time, many<br>
applications automatically search for a preferences file and, if it isn't found,<br>
immediately create one. But why? Has the user changed anything? Nope. The user<br>
probably hasn't even had an opportunity to pull down an application menu at this point.<br>
So why do we need to create a preferences file? We don't, and we shouldn't. 
</p>
<p>
But given those situations in which your application<i>should</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;create a preferences file,<br>
read on to learn how to do it the right way. 
</p>
<h2>WHAT MAKES A WELL IMPLEMENTED PREFERENCES FILE</h2>
<p>
The two Finder info windows shown in Figure 1 illustrate a poorly implemented and a<br>
well implemented preferences file. We can categorize the visible differences in Figure<br>
1 by file type, document kind, Finder icon, and version information, as explained in<br>
the following sections. Note that the concepts presented here apply to implementing<i>any</i><br>
kind of document file, not just preferences files.

<p>
<b>FILE TYPE</b><br>
Like any other file created by your application, your preferences file should have a<br>
unique file type, which is specified in a file reference ('FREF') resource in the<br>
application. The file type of the preferences file should be associated with the<br>
application signature so that the Finder can display which application created the file<br>
when its info window is shown. This association is made in your application's bundle<br>
('BNDL') resource, which includes the application signature, the file reference<br>
resources, and the application and document file icons. The info window for the poorly<br>
implemented preferences file shown in Figure 1 doesn't display any information about<br>
which application created the file because the file type isn't associated with an<br>
application signature.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, you should<i>not</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;use 'pref' as the file type for your preferences file; this<br>
file type is reserved for the Finder Preferences file (as you'd find out if you tried to<br>
register this file type with Apple's Developer Support Center -- you<i>were</i> going to do<br>
that for the file type of your preferences file, right?). If you were to give your<br>
preferences file this file type, you'd notice that when the user turns on Balloon Help,<br>
the Balloon Help for your preferences file is actually the Balloon Help for the Finder<br>
Preferences file. I'll go out on a limb here and assume that we can all agree this is<br>
confusing for users, and should therefore be avoided. 
</p>
<p>
<b>DOCUMENT KIND</b><br>
A file's Finder info window also indicates the kind of document the file is. In many<br>
cases, this field reads either "document" or something like "MegaWhizzyApp<br>
document." But with the introduction of the Translation Manager (first made available<br>
with Macintosh Easy Open), a new resource type has been defined that your application<br>
can use to more accurately describe its files, including its preferences file. This<br>
resource is called the 'kind' resource, and its Rez definition is as follows:
</p>
<pre>type 'kind' {
    literal longint;                /* App signature */
    integer;           /* Region code of kind string localizations */
    integer = 0;
    integer = $$CountOf(kindArray)  /* Array size */
    wide array kindArray {
        literal longint;            /* File type */
        pstring;                    /* Custom kind strings */
        align word;
    };
};</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
An example 'kind' resource might look like this:
</p>
<pre>resource 'kind' (128) {
    'TSTR',
    0,
    {
        'TEXT', "MegaWhizzyApp text document"
    }
};</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In this example, assuming the Translation Manager is present, a file with creator<br>
'TSTR' and file type 'TEXT' will display the string "MegaWhizzyApp text document" in<br>
the document kind field of its info window. 
</p>
<p>
<b>FINDER ICON</b><br>
As suggested in<i>Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines</i> , the best icon for preferences<br>
files is either the standard preferences file icon or an icon that incorporates some<br>
elements of the standard preferences file icon (see Figure 2). It's not taboo to use a<br>
unique preferences file icon, but this may make it difficult for users to recognize the<br>
file as a preferences file.

<p>
As noted above, you provide a Finder icon for your preferences file the same way that<br>
you provide Finder icons for your other document files -- through a bundle resource<br>
in your application. 
</p>
<p>
<b>VERSION INFORMATION</b><br>
A file's 'vers' (version) resources determine what version information is displayed in<br>
the Finder info window. There are normally two 'vers' resources for a file -- 'vers'<br>
IDs 1 and 2 -- and each contains the following: * A numeric code representing the<br>
version. This code consists of a major revision number, a minor revision number, an<br>
optional bug fix revision number, a stage code (development, alpha, beta, or final),<br>
and a revision level (for non-final stages).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* A region code, which indicates the<br>
localized version of system software appropriate for use with the file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* A short<br>
version string identifying the version number.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* A long version string consisting of<br>
the file version number and company copyright in 'vers' ID 1, and the product version<br>
number and name in 'vers' ID 2. 
</p>
<p>
For more information about these resources and how they affect what's displayed in the<br>
Finder info window, see pages 7-31 to 7-32 of<i>Inside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox</i><br>
<i>Essentials. </i> For the structs corresponding to the 'vers' resource, check out the Files.h<br>
header file. 
</p>
<p>
Providing version information in your preferences files does more than just make the<br>
Finder info window look pretty. You can use this information to identify the format of<br>
the data contained in a preferences file. This is useful in determining how to translate<br>
preferences data created by an older version of an application into the preferences<br>
format for the current version of the application. 
</p>
<h2>CAN USERS OPEN PREFERENCES FILES?</h2>
<p>
Users have a penchant for running rampant through their hard disks, looking for<br>
interesting files to open, particularly if the files weren't explicitly created by them.<br>
Files kept in the System Folder are no exception to this experimentation, so it should<br>
come as no surprise to you that your application should be prepared to correctly<br>
handle the case where its preferences file has been double-clicked. 
</p>
<p>
There are several interesting possible behaviors that a preferences file might exhibit<br>
under these circumstances. One alternative is that the application the preferences file<br>
belongs to could launch, configuring itself with the data contained in the file. A<br>
variation of this behavior would be to display the application's preferences dialog after<br>
launching, if such a dialog were supported. A third behavior is that when a user<br>
double-clicks a preferences file, its application isn't launched, but instead a dialog is<br>
displayed describing what the file is, where it belongs, and why it can't be opened. 
</p>
<p>
Today, the only preferences file behavior approved and documented by Apple is the last<br>
one. The Human Interface Design Center of Apple's system software group has this to<br>
say about preferences files:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Preferences files should not be treated as if they were documents created<br>
by the user. Launching an application and optionally opening a preferences<br>
dialog support the misconception that they<i>are</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;like documents. </li>
<li>Not all applications have preferences dialogs. Launching an application<br>
that doesn't have a preferences dialog when its preferences file is<br>
double-clicked is confusing, because there's nothing specific to show the user<br>
that represents the information stored in the file. </li>
<li>The current thinking is that a user doesn't open the System Folder, see a<br>
preferences file for MacWrite (for example), and wonder what the<br>
preferences for MacWrite are set to; he's more likely to see the file and<br>
wonder what it's used for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, an informative dialog that's displayed<br>
when the user attempts to open the preferences file better satisfies the user's<br>
intent. </li>
<li>Ideally, users shouldn't really even have to know about preferences files<br>
(and therefore shouldn't be able to double-click them), but they're an<br>
unavoidable artifact of the current system.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It should be pointed out that launching an application by double-clicking a file<br>
containing configuration data is not necessarily a bad thing -- it just shouldn't be done<br>
with a preferences file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your application could use an application-specific<br>
configuration file to allow users to store and set up custom configurations. By creating<br>
a specific file type for this information, you make it explicit to users that the<br>
behavior of this file type is different from that of preferences files, and that it is<br>
unique to your application. 
</p>
<p>
Now let's take a closer look at how to implement the recommended preferences file<br>
behavior. 
</p>
<p>
<b>SUPPRESSING LAUNCH UPON DOUBLE-CLICK</b><br>
As we learned in the previous section, a preferences file isn't intended to be a<br>
document that users can open and directly interact with in the application that created<br>
it. So how can you keep users from launching your application when they double-click<br>
your preferences file? 
</p>
<p>
Let's take a brief look at how the System 7 Finder handles opening document files.<br>
Normally, when a user tries to open a document file, the Finder searches for an<br>
application that has a signature matching the file creator. If the search is successful,<br>
the Finder launches the application and (if the application supports the required Apple<br>
event suite) sends an Open Documents Apple event to the application, with the<br>
document file as a parameter. If the search for the application that created the file<br>
isn't successful, an alert similar to the one shown in Figure 3 is displayed.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/202.gif" width="576 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 3. </b>Application-unavailable alert
</p>
<p>
Our problem is that we don't want the Finder to launch our application when a user<br>
attempts to open its preferences file. One way to solve this (as suggested on pages<br>
7-29 to 7-30 of<i> Inside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox Essentials</i> ) is to register a<br>
"dummy" application signature that's different from the real signature of your<br>
application, and then set this signature as the preferences file creator.
</p>
<p>
Normally, an application has only a single signature resource and a single bundle<br>
resource. By creating a second bundle resource with a dummy application signature<br>
and associating our preferences file with that signature, we fool the Finder into<br>
looking for a nonexistent application for our preferences file, thus preventing the<br>
Finder from launching our application when the preferences file is double-clicked.<br>
Figure 4 shows examples of a normal application bundle resource and a dummy bundle<br>
resource for the application's preferences file. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Remember to register both creators </b> -- the real one and the dummy one --<br>
with the Developer Support Center (AppleLink DEVSUPPORT, or Apple Computer, Inc.,<br>
Creator/File Type Registration, 20525 Mariani Avenue, M/S 303-2T, Cupertino, CA<br>
95014).
</p>
<p>
If you use this technique, you should also supply an application-missing message<br>
string resource -- an 'STR ' resource with an ID of -16397 -- in the preferences<br>
file. When the user tries to open a file and the application can't be found, the Finder<br>
looks for this resource in the file. That string is displayed in the alert that comes up<br>
when the user tries to open the file and -- due to the dummy bundle resource -- fails<br>
(see Figure 5).

<p>
<b>Figure 5. </b>Can't open preferences file alert
</p>
<p>
Now for the catch: There are two ways this mechanism can be circumvented. First, it<br>
can be overridden if Macintosh Easy Open is running. Macintosh Easy Open uses the<br>
Translation Manager to open a file with an alternate application if the application that<br>
created the file isn't available. It determines the file type of the file that the user is<br>
trying to open and then looks for applications that support that file type by checking<br>
their bundle resources. If no applications can be found that support the file type, an<br>
alert notifying the user is displayed (see Figure 6). However, if any alternate<br>
applications are found, an alert allowing the user to open the file with one of them is<br>
displayed (see Figure 7). When Macintosh Easy Open is installed, one of these two<br>
alerts will always be displayed in place of the normal application-unavailable alert. 
</p>
<p>
Because our application has a dummy bundle resource that refers to the file type of<br>
our preferences file, Macintosh Easy Open will always find the application that created<br>
the preferences file as an alternate application. Fortunately, the Translation Manager<br>
provides a mechanism to help us hide our preferences file -- the 'open' resource. In<br>
the 'open' resource, an application can specify to the Translation Manager exactly what<br>
file types it can actually open, regardless of what may be specified in any bundle<br>
resources. By creating an 'open' resource that doesn't contain our preferences file<br>
type, we can prevent Macintosh Easy Open from trying to open the file.
</p>
<p>
The Rez definition for the 'open' resource is given below. 
</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<pre>type 'open' {
    literal longint;               /* App signature */
    integer = 0;
    integer = $$CountOf(typeArray) /* Array size */
    wide array typeArray {         /* File types that app can open */
        literal longint;           /* File type */
    };
};</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
An example 'open' resource might look like this:
</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<pre>resource 'open' (128) {
    'TSTR',
    {
        'TEXT'
    }
};</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<img src="img/206.gif" width="576 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 6. </b>Modified application-unavailable alert
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/207.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 7. </b>Translation choices alert
</p>
<p>
In this example, we've declared that the application with creator 'TSTR' can only open<br>
files of type 'TEXT' -- the Translation Manager will not attempt to use this application<br>
to open any other type of file. 
</p>
<p>
Our mechanism is also circumvented if the file type of the preferences file is 'PICT' or<br>
'TEXT' and TeachText is installed. In this case, the Finder displays an alert asking<br>
whether the user wants to open the document in TeachText, even if you supplied an<br>
application-missing message string resource in the file and provided the appropriate<br>
dummy bundle and 'open' resource in your application. This is a pretty good reason for<br>
not using 'PICT' or 'TEXT' as the file type for your preferences file. 
</p>
<h2>WHAT GOES IN A PREFERENCES FILE</h2>
<p>
If you find the size of your preferences file breaking the megabyte (or even the 100K)<br>
barrier, you're probably keeping information in the file that really doesn't belong<br>
there. What follows are a few thoughts on what to put in your preferences files. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Keep your preferences as resources.</b><br>
As we all know, you can put program data into either the data fork or the resource fork<br>
of a Macintosh HFS file. The popular response to the question "What is a resource?" is<br>
"Everything!", and this is still reasonable advice. It's fairly easy to design C structs<br>
that mirror the structures of your preferences data, and you can even design 'TMPL'<br>
resources that will let you look at your raw preferences data in a structured way by<br>
opening your preferences file with ResEdit. Plus, you've got the Resource Manager to<br>
do all the work of finding and loading the preferences data into memory for you. What<br>
more could you ask? 
</p>
<p>
<b>Keep only global user preferences in your preferences file.</b><br>
Bear in mind that some user preferences are global (application or environment<br>
related) and some are local (document related) -- don't confuse the two. For example,<br>
keeping track of the size and position of every document window that's ever been<br>
opened by your application in its preferences file isn't a good idea (this information<br>
should be kept with the document file corresponding to the document window), but<br>
keeping a user-specified default window size and position in its preferences file<i>is</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;a<br>
good idea. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Avoid keeping machine-specific information in your preferences file.</b><br>
It's rare that you really need to keep information such as the system software version<br>
or the Macintosh model that your software is running on in your preferences file. Your<br>
application generally should examine its environment at launch, and take appropriate<br>
measures at that time to avoid using features that aren't supported in the current<br>
environment. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Be careful of storing dynamic information in your preferences file.</b><br>
A good example of something not to store in your preferences file is a volume reference<br>
number. To quote<i> Inside Macintosh: Files</i> , "A volume reference number is valid only<br>
until the volume is unmounted -- if a single volume is mounted and then unmounted,<br>
the File Manager may assign it a different volume reference number when it is next<br>
mounted." In this example, a better solution is to store an alias to the volume of<br>
interest in the preferences file. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Use discretion in deciding what preferences to keep.</b><br>
To a large degree, this means limiting user options to those that actually improve the<br>
overall user experience. The only proven way to find out what those options are is to<br>
conduct user testing on a variety of interface prototypes. It may turn out that while<br>
you thought keeping track of the last known number of documents open during the<br>
user's last session with your application was important, it actually adds little or<br>
nothing when translated into the user's experience.
</p>
<p>
<b>Don't keep static program data in your preferences file.</b><br>
A file that just contains a lot of canned program data (such as tax forms) is<i>not</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;a<br>
preferences file -- it's simply a program data file, and it should normally reside in<br>
the same folder as the application. That way, the user doesn't disable the application if<br>
she throws away what she thinks is simply the application's preferences file (users<br>
often do this to cause an application to reset back to its "factory" defaults, which, when<br>
you think about it, is a pretty nasty way to make users reset a program). 
</p>
<h2>THE STANDARD PREFERENCES LIBRARY</h2>
<p>
We'll now take a look at the standard preferences library, a library for creating and<br>
interacting with preferences files that follows all the rules we've set in the preceding<br>
sections. The library API consists of 11 calls, described in detail below.
</p>
<p>
<b>CREATING AND MANIPULATING A PREFERENCES FILE</b><br>
In the routines described here, you'll notice that a preferences file is primarily<br>
identified not by its name, but by its creator and file type. This is done to allow you to<br>
localize the name of your preferences file easily, without requiring any code or<br>
resource changes. Also, should a userinadvertently rename your preferences file, your<br>
application can still find it. Because preferences files are identified in this manner,<br>
it's important to remember to give each preferences file that your application uses a<br>
unique creator/file type combination. The search sequence for a preferences file is as<br>
follows: 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there's a Preferences folder in the System Folder, search it and any<br>
folders within it (including nested ones).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there's no Preferences folder, or if no<br>
preferences file is found in the Preferences folder, search the files (not the folders)<br>
in the System Folder. 
</p>
<pre>pascal OSErr NewPreferencesFile (OSType creator, OSType fileType,
    ConstStr31Param fileName, ConstStr31Param folderName,
    ConstStr31Param ownerName);</pre>
<p>
NewPreferencesFile creates a preferences file with the specified creator, file type,<br>
and filename in the System Folder (prior to System 7) or in the Preferences folder<br>
(in System 7 or later). In the folderName argument, you can specify a custom<br>
preferences folder in which to put a collection of preferences files; pass nil for this<br>
argument if you don't want to use a custom preferences folder. If a folder name is<br>
provided and the folder doesn't exist, NewPreferencesFile creates it. Another option is<br>
to provide, in the ownerName argument, the name of the program (application,<br>
extension, or whatever) that's creating the preferences file; if this argument is<br>
supplied, a custom application- missing message string resource is created for the<br>
preferences file. 
</p>
<pre>pascal OSErr OpenPreferencesFile (OSType creator, OSType fileType,
    short *refNum);</pre>
<p>
OpenPreferencesFile opens the preferences file having the specified creator and file<br>
type. You must have created the file with NewPreferencesFile before making this call.<br>
The preferences file reference is returned in the refNum argument; you'll use this to<br>
identify which preferences file you're operating on when making other calls in the<br>
standard preferences library. 
</p>
<pre>pascal OSErr ClosePreferencesFile (short refNum);</pre>
<p>
ClosePreferencesFile closes the preferences file having the specified file reference.<br>
That's it. 
</p>
<pre>pascal OSErr DeletePreferencesFile (OSType creator, OSType fileType);</pre>
<p>
DeletePreferencesFile deletes the preferences file having the specified creator and file<br>
type. Be sure the specified preferences file is closed before making this call.
</p>
<pre>pascal OSErr DeletePreferencesFolder (ConstStr31Param folderName);</pre>
<p>
DeletePreferencesFolder deletes the custom preferences folder specified by<br>
folderName, along with any contents. Be sure there are no open preferences files in the<br>
specified folder before making this call. 
</p>
<pre>pascal OSErr PreferencesFileExists (OSType creator, OSType fileType);</pre>
<p>
PreferencesFileExists simply checks to see if a preferences file having the specified<br>
creator and file type already exists. You can use this call to determine whether you<br>
need to create a new preferences file. 
</p>
<p>
<b>ACCESSING INFORMATION IN A PREFERENCES FILE</b><br>
These routines get or set the indicated resource information in the preferences file<br>
specified by the refNum parameter. 
</p>
<pre>pascal OSErr GetPreferencesFileVersion (short refNum, short versID,
    NumVersion *numVersion, short *regionCode, ConstStr255Param
    shortVersionStr, ConstStr255Param longVersionStr);</pre>
<p>
GetPreferencesFileVersion returns the contents of the specified 'vers' resource of the<br>
preferences file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only 'vers' ID 1 or 2 is allowed.
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;For those of you wondering </b>why GetPreferencesFileVersion doesn't simply pass a<br>
pointer to a VersRec (defined in Files.h) instead of passing each of the separate fields<br>
of a VersRec, it's because the short version string and the long version string are<br>
packed in a VersRec (it's possible that the shortVersion field of the VersRec will<br>
actually contain part of the long version string). GetPreferencesFileVersion takes care<br>
of unpacking the strings properly, and SetPreferencesFileVersion takes care of<br>
packing them properly.
</p>
<pre>pascal OSErr SetPreferencesFileVersion (short refNum, short versID,
    NumVersion *numVersion, short regionCode, ConstStr255Param
    shortVersionStr, ConstStr255Param longVersionStr);</pre>
<p>
SetPreferencesFileVersion allows you to set the contents of the specified 'vers'<br>
resource of the preferences file. Only 'vers' ID 1 or 2 is allowed. 
</p>
<pre>pascal OSErr ReadPreference (short refNum, ResType resourceType,
    short *resourceID, Handle *preference);</pre>
<p>
ReadPreference reads from the preferences file the resource specified by the<br>
resourceType and resourceID arguments, and returns it in the preference argument. If<br>
you pass nil as the address of the resourceID argument or 0 as its value,<br>
ReadPreference finds the first resource with the specified type in the preferences file.<br>
If you pass 0 as the value of resourceID, ReadPreference returns the resource ID<br>
corresponding to the preference resource it found.
</p>
<pre>pascal OSErr WritePreference (short refNum, ResType resourceType,
    short *resourceID, Handle preference);</pre>

WritePreference writes the resource specified by the resourceType and resourceID<br>
arguments to the preferences file. If you pass nil as the address of the resourceID<br>
argument or 0 as its value, WritePreference assigns the preference resource a<br>
resource ID and returns it in the resourceID argument (if its address isn't nil). If a<br>
resource with the same resource type and ID already exists in the preferences file, the<br>
existing resource is replaced with the new one. WritePreference checks that there<br>
will be a minimum amount (the exact amount varies as a function of the volume's<br>
allocation block size) of disk space remaining on the volume containing the blessed<br>
System Folder before actually updating the preferences file; if there isn't enough disk<br>
space, the preferences file is unmodified and an error is returned. Note that it's the<br>
caller's responsibility to release the memory occupied by the preference argument;<br>
WritePreference does not dispose of this memory automatically.

DeletePreference deletes the resource specified by the resourceType and resourceID<br>
arguments from the preferences file. If you pass 0 as the value of resourceID,<br>
DeletePreference deletes the first resource with the specified type in the preferences<br>
file.

In this article, we've explored what constitutes good design for preferences files, and<br>
we've examined a library that helps with implementing preferences files. Armed with<br>
this knowledge and the standard preferences library, you too can add preferences files<br>
to your application the preferred way!

boisterous, and relatively unknown bands playing in a variety of beer-drenched pubs,<br>
in the company of equally interesting, boisterous, and beer-drenched people, a better<br>
