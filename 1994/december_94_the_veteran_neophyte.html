Take a good look around at all the different structures you see in the world. Not only<br>
the physical structures, like buildings and mountains and dogs and trees, but the<br>
conceptual structures, like language and government and the Dewey decimal system and<br>
the management hierarchy at your place of work. Some of these structures seem to<br>
exist independently of humans, but others seem to be completely invented, made up<br>
from whole cloth, so to speak. But how can that be? Can you really create something<br>
from nothing? I wonder. 
</p>
<p>
I just got back from a sort of educational/recreational summer camp for adults (I'm<br>
writing this in early August). It was the California Coast Music Camp, a week of<br>
intensive classes and refreshing musical single-mindedness. There were no cars, no<br>
computers, no worries -- nothing to do but play and sing and learn (and swim and eat<br>
and hike). 
</p>
<p>
The camp itself was classic: squat brown bunkhouses scattered in small groups like big<br>
hollow dice; long low latrines, redolent with that cloyingly sweet chemical peculiar to<br>
outdoor bathrooms; enormous vats of jello and drowned salad at the ends of the long<br>
serving tables in the echoing dining hall; bug bites, bug spray, and bugs -- you get the<br>
idea. And even though it was strictly adults, all the same feelings I remember from my<br>
one camp experience as a kid were there in the wide and ragged spectrum of emotions it<br>
generated. I had the same scary and uncertain feelings at the beginning, wondering if I<br>
really should be there at all; the same gradual discovery that it was all OK, and in fact<br>
was fantastic; and, at the end, the same bittersweet longing to start it all over again.
</p>
<p>
Music really is a lovely thing. One of the classes I took was called "Theory, Scales, and<br>
Chord Construction on the Guitar" and it was on the third day of class, as I was<br>
plunking away at yet another arpeggio, that I began to get my first glimpse of the<br>
underlying structure of the notes on the guitar fretboard. (And I do mean glimpse: it's<br>
something that will probably take a year or more to see clearly, and five or ten years<br>
to really feel -- and that's if I practice every day.) I was suddenly struck by the<br>
notion that it's the discontinuities in musical scales that make them both difficult and<br>
interesting, that it's the complications in the structure of music that give it an<br>
interesting shape. If you've ever taken a music theory class, or even a piano class, you<br>
might know what I mean: if only there were a black key between every pair of white<br>
keys, things would be much simpler. It's that damned half step between B and C and<br>
between E and F that screws things up. But it also seems that those discontinuities --<br>
those bumps and dips in an otherwise smooth, even progression -- are what give rise<br>
to all the beauty and complexity and subtlety. It's precisely those "flaws" in the<br>
structure that lend it an interesting texture. 
</p>
<p>
However, the structure itself is artificial. Underneath, the range of musical tones is<br>
actually continuous, as any slide whistle demonstrates. It's a spectrum, a continuously<br>
varying quantity, in this case the frequency of vibration of a material. So the set of<br>
notes we use -- our tuning system -- is externally applied, a necessarily arbitrary<br>
set of discrete slots pasted onto an underlying continuum. It's a sort ofquantization of<br>
something inherently smooth that lends it a tractable structure, that gives us a handle<br>
with which to manipulate it and a context in which to make sense of it. By conceptually<br>
making the smoothly varying curve into a step function, by arbitrarily chopping the<br>
continuous line into discrete chunks, we can somehow work with it more manageably<br>
and think about it more clearly. 
</p>
<p>
If you look around a little, you'll find examples of this kind of artificial structuring of<br>
continuums all over the place. The computer in front of you (or wherever it is) is an<br>
excellent example. Many early computers were analog; they dealt with smoothly<br>
varying quantities (usually voltages in circuits). But they turned out to be too hard to<br>
program -- in effect you had to create a physical circuit that modeled the problem you<br>
wanted to solve. By making the computer purely digital, we abstracted its operation<br>
away from the physical realm into the realm of pure logic, and that really opened up a<br>
lot of doors. Another much simpler example is a radio dial; it actually represents a<br>
continuous spread of frequencies, but we've arbitrarily divided it into bands so that we<br>
can parcel it out to those who want to use pieces of it. 
</p>
<p>
More abstractly, in mathematics one often takes a continuously varying function and<br>
"pretends" for a moment that it's a step function, simply because it makes things<br>
easier to deal with. Then, when you've got a handle on the step function, you can use a<br>
nifty trick (called calculus) to sort of extrapolate what you've discovered about the<br>
steps and apply it to the whole curve. Time itself (which sure feels like a continuum,<br>
whatever it is) is conveniently chopped into bits by humans to make it easier to keep<br>
track of and to talk about. 
</p>
<p>
But there are other quantities in our world that seem to come to us already divided up<br>
into discrete chunks, already structured. The periodic table of the elements certainly<br>
isn't a continuum. There's no smooth transition between sodium and magnesium,<br>
though they sit next to each other in the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction between the phases of<br>
matter -- solids, liquids, and gases -- seems pretty clear, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Well, OK, there are<br>
some bizarre in-between states you learn about in college, but they're encountered<br>
only in extreme conditions, usually artificially induced in laboratories and definitely<br>
inhospitable to mammals.) Living things appear to be made up of lots of discrete<br>
functional blocks -- organs and cells and organelles and protein molecules and such --<br>
and the interactions of these discrete parts are what makes them "go." DNA itself, the<br>
structure that stores the instructions for building, is just a binary (or rather<br>
quaternary) string, with each discrete position capable of storing only four possible<br>
values. Even the seeming continuum of a fluid like water is an illusion. In reality it's<br>
made of discrete particles, and it's their interactions with one another that give rise to<br>
"fluidness."
</p>
<p>
This endless interplay between the continuous and the discrete, between discovering<br>
structure and creating it, seems to be at the heart of many (maybe most) human<br>
endeavors. On the one hand, we often labor mightily to reveal structures that are<br>
somehow already there. Many of the sciences, in particular, are precisely an attempt<br>
to make clear the underlying structure of the universe, to peel away the layers of<br>
obfuscation that our senses have piled on. But it's not limited to science: Michelangelo<br>
spoke of sculpting not as inventing the shape of the statue, but rather as freeing it<br>
from the stone in which it was imprisoned. 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, many human activities are all about applying structure to<br>
something formless, or about creating structure from nothingness. Again, the arts<br>
spring to mind. A painting, a poem, a story, a song -- all these begin from nothing:<br>
from a blank canvas, from an empty sheet of paper, from silence. Computer programs,<br>
those awesomely complex logical constructions we devote ourselves to so slavishly,<br>
seem to be created from thin air, and serve as the structure for an otherwise<br>
"formless" machine. Business contracts, sheet metal ventilation ducts, bingo games,<br>
steering committees, and acoustic guitars -- these are all structures that we've<br>
created from, essentially, nothingness. 
</p>
<p>
Ah, but there's the real question: are the structures we build really new? Do we really<br>
just invent them, whole, from nothing? Or do they grow from and reflect other<br>
underlying structures that are already there? The latter seems much more likely to<br>
me. If you look closely, even a structure that at first blush seems really new turns out<br>
to be a recombination or an extension or a reworking of some existing structure.<br>
Sometimes I think of evolutionary processes this way, as a sort of extrapolation, a<br>
patient elaboration, of a very few essential, innate principles that lie buried far<br>
beneath the surface, an endless cycle of structure standing on the shoulders of what has<br>
gone before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the macroscopic shapes of living things hint at the underlying<br>
nature of matter: quantum reality writ large, for all to see. 
</p>
<p>
So, getting back to music, does the tuning system that we use reflect some underlying<br>
structure, some relationship among the frequencies, or is it truly arbitrary, decided<br>
by some bewigged old coot in the dim and dusty past? To find out, I did a little snooping<br>
around in the local library and on the net. The answer turns out to be complex (no<br>
surprise there), and it has as much to do with accidents of history, people's<br>
personalities, and the practicalities of tuning instruments as it does with mathematics.<br>
There is an underlying structure beneath the western tuning system and many others<br>
(the relationships among the harmonics of a vibrating string or column of air, first<br>
elaborated by -- you guessed it -- the Greeks). But it also turns out that most music<br>
has evolved away from those "ideal" frequencies for a variety of reasons that have<br>
little to do with mathematics or physics. Here's what I think: I think the structure of<br>
music is largely determined by the structure of us. 
</p>
<p>
Sunburst shapes -- mandalas -- appear over and over in pictures drawn by children,<br>
no matter what their culture or language or what part of the world they live in. You<br>
could argue that it's simply because there are lots of radially symmetric things in the<br>
world, and that children are simply drawing what they see. But I prefer to think that<br>
mandalas somehow mirror the internal structure of the human mind, that they are, in<br>
a sense, pictures of humanity. 
</p>
<p>
Humans spend enormous amounts of time shaping things, refining things, expressing<br>
things, creating. Where does all the structure come from? I think it's simply an<br>
outgrowth, an elaboration, a reinterpretation and repackaging, of the structure inside<br>
ourselves, which in turn reflects the structure of the universe we live in. Taken all<br>
together -- all the songs, all the buildings, all the stories, all the social groupings and<br>
computer programs and bad jokes and trash and art -- the structures we humans<br>
reveal and create form a churning, turbulent, clouded mirror, a mirror that<br>
occasionally, if we look very closely, may afford us a glimpse of who and what we<br>
really are.

<b>DAVE JOHNSON </b>has for years had the same favorite quote, from Albert Einstein: "He<br>
. . . who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead; his eyes<br>
are closed." But recently he encountered another, in a book by Primo Levi, that came<br>
very close to unseating Einstein's: "It is enough to think of intestinal worms: they feed<br>
themselves at our expense with a food so perfect that, unique in creation, together<br>
perhaps with the angels, they have no anus." Although Dave howled uncontrollably at<br>
that one, Einstein still wins in the end. *
