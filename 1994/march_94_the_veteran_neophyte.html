In the interest of pushing back the boundaries of human knowledge in my own small<br>
way, I decided to conduct a little survey via e-mail. I asked only one question:
</p>
<p>
<i>What's so interesting about programming computers, anyway?</i>
</p>
<p>
I sent out 87 letters and received 37 direct responses, a 43% return rate! This is a<br>
fantastic return rate for a survey. As one respondent wrote:What an interesting<br>
survey! Getting hackers to talk about themselves should be easy! 
</p>
<p>
It was. 
</p>
<p>
To alleviate your suspense, here are the top two reasons programmers program,<br>
according to my survey:<br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Programmers like solving problems and puzzles. (49%)<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Programming is a creative outlet. (36%)
</p>
<p>
In the survey itself I included some hypothetical answers to my own question, as<br>
follows:
</p>
<p>
<i>Do you just like doing puzzles? Is it the money? Was it a horrible accident, and you</i><br>
<i>were supposed to be a doctor when you grew up? Is it because you're really an artist,</i><br>
<i>and computers are the best medium around?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it because it's the only profession</i><br>
<i>where you don't need to wear shoes to meetings? Is it because you get to hang out with</i><br>
<i>smart people?</i>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, while this accurately conveyed my enthusiasm for the subject, it also<br>
completely shredded any objectivity my survey might have had, and skewed the results<br>
sharply toward the tight, square little box of my preconceptions. Note that the top<br>
reason appears in this list, and furthermore it appears first. Coincidence? I think not.<br>
As one alert respondent pointed out, I even blurred the important distinction between<br>
what makes programming interesting and what makes it a nice business to be in.<br>
Sheesh. 
</p>
<p>
Abandoning rigor and embracing whimsy, I decided to dump all the responses into one<br>
big text file and do a word frequency analysis of the whole thing, logging how many<br>
times each word appeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignoring the common words likethe and the expected words<br>
likeprogram , the winner was problem, at 12 occurrences. Game came in a close<br>
second, at 11 appearances. Three words tied for third place, at 8 occurrences:fun,<br>
interesting, and think.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowthis is a satisfying analysis! 
</p>
<p>
Other frequently appearing words were these:puzzle, art, control, creation, enjoy,<br>
paid, challenge, complex, efficient, god, high, hooked, money, music, play,and solving.<br>
Taken together, they make astrangely accurate mantra about what programming is<br>
like, and probably describe in a more complete way than any individual answer why<br>
people program. 
</p>
<p>
But let's look again at those top two reasons. In second place we have "Programming is<br>
a creative outlet." That fact was mentioned over and over again, but creativity comes in<br>
many varieties, and it's interesting to look at the metaphors people chose to describe<br>
the act of writing software.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, they fell into three very distinct<br>
categories: programmer as mechanic, programmer as artist, and programmer as God. 
</p>
<p>
The similarities between computer programming and mechanical engineering may be<br>
deeper than it seems at first glance:
</p>
<p>
<i>I got hooked on erector sets when I was young.</i><br>
-- John Powers
</p>
<p>
But if programmers are just frustrated machinists, then why don't they get up from<br>
their computers and build real machines? Here's why:
</p>
<p>
<i>On a computer, I can build an amazingly fantastic and elegant gadget, with thousands of</i><br>
<i>working parts all cooperating pleasantly with one another, and I never have to get my</i><br>
<i>hands dirty.</i><br>
-- Jeremy Nguyen
</p>
<p>
If you're willing to build your machines behind the glass of a computer monitor, to<br>
build them out of logical stuff instead of real stuff, then suddenly the landscape of<br>
possible machines becomes effectively infinite. You can build any machine you<br>
canthink of, and all those pesky, annoying details like friction and inertia and tensile<br>
strength just fall away. For people who like to design machines, and especially for<br>
those who aren't so keen on the grease and skinned knuckles, this is a powerful<br>
attraction. 
</p>
<p>
Other people chose to compare programming with creating art:
</p>
<p>
<i>I'm not very good at art, but when I write something that works well I feel like an</i><br>
<i>artist creating a piece of artwork.</i><br>
-- Kevin Mellander
</p>
<p>
<i>My father is a painter, and I grew up watching him continually producing new artwork</i><br>
<i>. . . Software is just another medium, less messy, easier to change.</i><br>
-- Fred Huxham
</p>
<p>
Programming is definitely a means of expression, and unlike other media software can<br>
simulate everyother medium; in Alan Kay's words it's ameta-medium.&nbsp;&nbsp;For those with<br>
an artistic leaning this is rich ground, indeed: you can create your artandyou can<br>
create new ways of creating art. 
</p>
<p>
My own favorite creation metaphor is programmer as God:
</p>
<p>
<i>I like it because you can play God, albeit on a microscopic scale. It's hard to explain,</i><br>
<i>but writing code is like creating new life.</i><br>
-- Dave Hersey
</p>
<p>
<i>It is the closest I can get to being God (without lifetimes of sadhana). I get to sculpt a</i><br>
<i>little "life-form" that, while admittedly unsophisticated, has a satisfying degree of</i><br>
<i>autonomy.</i><br>
-- Corey Vian
</p>
<p>
Since software is something that's dynamic in time and semi-autonomous, it can fairly<br>
convincingly imitate living things, in much the same way that machinery often can.<br>
But since the software "machines" that computers allow us to construct can be orders<br>
of magnitude more complex thanmachines in the real world, their resemblance to life<br>
can be much more compelling, much more striking. 
</p>
<p>
The joy of solving problems (or thecompulsion to solve them, as the case may be)<br>
seems to be the major reason people program. My favorite survey response of all sums<br>
this up nicely:
</p>
<p>
<i>The reason I program is because I'm a compulsive problem solver and my computer is</i><br>
<i>a never-ending source of problems.</i><br>
-- Craig Prouse
</p>
<p>
It's the twin meaning of "never-ending" that I love so much here. The fact that the<br>
problems never end is one of those "both blessing and curse" features that computers<br>
seem to overflow with. On the one hand, it means that we have an inexhaustible source<br>
of puzzles and problems to slake our thirsts, but on the other hand it means that we<br>
can never really be finished, and like Sisyphus rolling his stone up the hill, we are<br>
doomed to repetitive toil, solving the same kinds of puzzles over and over again. 
</p>
<p>
Here are some of the other reasons people gave, which didn't fall neatly into any<br>
category:
</p>
<p>
<i>It's basically because I have all these ideas in my head, and a computer is the best way</i><br>
<i>to get them OUT of my head . . .</i><br>
-- Jeff Barbose
</p>
<p>
<i>Solving the problems is fun, but I must admit that I enjoy the company of the machine</i><br>
<i>-- it's not every day you meet somebody who will associate with you unconditionally.</i><br>
-- Steve Beitzel
</p>
<p>
<i>I program to get back at my senior year English teacher. I once got a bad grade on an</i><br>
<i>English paper, and she couldn't give me any concrete reasons why. She just didn't like</i><br>
<i>it. The computer, on the other hand, always gives me a reason why I'm incorrect. It's a</i><br>
<i>game I play with my Mac . . . There are a bunch of rules and it tells me (usually via a</i><br>
<i>bus error) that I broke one.</i><br>
-- Konstantin Othmer
</p>
<p>
<i>It's the one thing in my life that is easy to debug.</i><br>
-- Michael Weingartner
</p>
<p>
These last two hint at something else that I think might be important. In sharp contrast<br>
to the real world, the world of the computer is reassuringly knowable. What this<br>
means is thatcomputer problems always have answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a discoverable<br>
reason behind a computer's behavior, and I can't help wondering whether this is one of<br>
the major reasons people get such satisfaction from programming. 
</p>
<p>
Most questions we ask about the real world turn out to be hopelessly complicated. How<br>
can we improve the economy? No neat and tidy answer to that one. Why does your child<br>
love those particular red plastic boots so much? That's not really answerable in any<br>
complete way. Why is ice slippery? Why is the sky blue? How do birds know when it's<br>
time to fly south? None of these questions have clean answers. 
</p>
<p>
Ironically, though, there seems to be a basic human need tofindanswers. Look at the<br>
huge amount of time and energy we spend trying to discover and proclaim truths about<br>
our world. Religion, art, and science are all manifestations of the human desire to<br>
understand. So it's no surprise that computers, with their fantastically complex but<br>
ultimately knowable behavior, are extremely satisfying artifacts to spend time<br>
grappling with. Finding the answers can be enormously challenging, but there's always<br>
an answer to be found:
</p>
<p>
<i>It gives me one thing I *know* I can boss around.</i><br>
-- Jim Luther
</p>
<p>
Amen.

DAVE JOHNSON's favorite book between the ages of 5 and 11 was the&nbsp;&nbsp;World Book<br>
Encyclopedia. Sometimes in the early mornings, before anyone else was awake, he'd<br>
sneak out of bed, creep quietly through the dark and silent house to the living room,<br>
and slip a volume from the shelf. ("M" is fondly remembered to this day: matches,<br>
monsters, motors . . . ) Stopping off in the kitchen for a stack of cookies, he'd make his<br>
way back to his bed, and stay there reading and generating crumbs as the sun came<br>
up.*
