<p>
&nbsp;Dear Readers,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;We're excited to bring you, in this issue,&nbsp;&nbsp;develop's first Newton article. Even if<br>
you're not set up for Newton development, you may find this article of interest. But<br>
it's the article on zooming windows that inspired this editorial. The subject is user<br>
interface annoyances: those cases where the application doesn't quite do what the user<br>
expects it to -- as when a window zooms to an odd location -- and the user has to<br>
adjust for it. So what's the big deal? Well, it all adds up. Over time, the harm to the<br>
user from compensating for these problems can be physical as well as mental. You'll<br>
end up with a customer who is suffering in more ways than one.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;As Joan Stigliani puts it in her forthcoming book, <i>High-Tech Health: The Computer</i><br>
<i>User's Survival Guide: </i> "Software can make you work hard and contribute to overuse if<br>
it requires a lot of mouse use -- clicking and dragging, scrolling, moving the cursor<br>
back and forth across the screen -- or a lot of complex key sequences or excessive<br>
keying. Software that is difficult or frustrating to use can increase stress and tension."<br>
This especially struck a chord with me, since I suffer from tendinitis caused by<br>
excessive keying and mousing. So I'm going to take advantage of this opportunity to vent<br>
my frustration (isn't that what editorials are for?). Mainly, I hope to have at least<br>
some small influence on how you design the interface for your applications in the<br>
future.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Why do so many applications lack common sense? Why, for example, shouldn't Print<br>
or Save work on my frontmost document even if the active window happens to be a<br>
dialog box? Why can't I just type Command-F followed by text to be found rather than<br>
first have to select the text that the application (for some odd reason) didn't choose to<br>
highlight in the Find dialog? Why, even on my two-page monitor, do I have to resize a<br>
teeny window for every piece of e-mail I receive, or read a mere eight lines at a time,<br>
scrolling repeatedly (excessively) to get to the end? Why, when I cut a double-clicked<br>
word and then paste it, do so few applications add spaces intelligently?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The list of user interface superfluities goes on and on; these are only the problems I<br>
encounter most frequently each day. Please, give my hands (and my mind) a break! If I<br>
may make a few suggestions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't blindly follow what other applications have done: maybe they didn't<br>
think it through well enough. There's a place for guidelines and precedents,<br>
but don't totally disregard common sense. </li>
<li>Use the application yourself for real tasks until you're blue in the face.<br>
Be honest; what bugs you about it? Your users will be even less tolerant.</li>
<li>Do extensive user testing before first ship, of course -- but even after<br>
you ship, solicit feedback and incorporate it into the next release. Be sure to<br>
get feedback from experienced users, not just first-timers. </li>
<li>Beware of creeping featurism: fix problems your testers or customers<br>
have with current features before adding new ones. </li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;These suggestions are based on my own experience as the user manual writer and&nbsp;&nbsp;ad<br>
hoc product manager for the first version of the WriteNow application. John Anderson,<br>
one of the authors of WriteNow, says he thinks interface problems stem from software<br>
being too hard to write (something his next product will address) and from the related<br>
problem of software teams being too large. With many specialized programmers on a<br>
project, no one person focuses on the overall picture well enough to make the requisite<br>
intelligent decisions about the interface. Given a large team, a good product manager<br>
can make all the difference in the world. Look for someone both knowledgeable about<br>
the market and able to grasp the technical issues. As I noted about technical writing in<br>
an earlier editorial, product management isn't a job that just any smart person can do,<br>
or that CEOs or VPs should tackle in their spare time.
</p>
<p>
So I guess the moral is that more is not always better -- not when it comes to features<br>
in an application or programmers on a project, and certainly not when it comes to<br>
keystrokes and mouse clicks in an interface. Please, keep it clean.

&nbsp;Caroline Rose Editor

<p>
CAROLINE ROSE (AppleLink CROSE) started writing and programming at a company<br>
called Tymshare, where she thought at first that the terminal was the computer. (She<br>
was stunned to learn it occupied a huge room in another building.) By the time<br>
computers&nbsp;&nbsp;were the size of terminals, Caroline was on her way to Apple to write<br>
Inside Macintosh. She digressed to spend five years at NeXT, where she managed the<br>
Publications group, but returned to the Apple fold to edit develop. Caroline owes her<br>
love of the printed word to her father, who worked for the&nbsp;&nbsp;New York Daily News for<br>
over 50 years. There was no greater thrill as a child than to go to the office with him<br>
and see the copy desks, darkrooms, printing presses -- and, of course, the editors.<br>
She'd like to take this opportunity to say thanks, Dad, and Happy 85th Birthday!*
