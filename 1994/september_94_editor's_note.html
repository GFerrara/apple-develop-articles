<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>

<p>
Around the time I was faced with writing this editorial, I had just attended the<br>
celebration of my friend Mrs. Robertson's 100th birthday, and my 85-year-old<br>
father had flown over from Florida to celebrate it with us. With the subject of<br>
longevity on my mind, I got to thinking about how it relates to <i>develop</i> .
</p>
<p>
<i>develop</i> 's goal is to provide you with articles and code that will have a long life -- that<br>
can live in your applications happily and compatibly even as new Macintosh systems<br>
are introduced. We do all we can to ensure this (at the risk of incurring the wrath of<br>
our authors, who may wonder why it takes so long to see something in print after&nbsp;&nbsp;it's<br>
submitted to <i>develop</i> ). We'd rather an article "have legs" than be published<br>
prematurely and get you into trouble further down the line. We do our best to test the<br>
code and get our technical reviewers' opinions on whether a particular method is safe.<br>
This should be a primary concern of all developers, especially now in light of the<br>
whole new world of Power Macintosh systems.
</p>
<p>
Evidence that we're succeeding is that we still get requests to reprint articles as far<br>
back as Issue 2, and we often hear from readers who save every issue because they<br>
retain their usefulness. (Remember that, the next time you're thinning out your<br>
bookshelves!)
</p>
<p>
Our being an Apple publication gives us the distinct advantage of being able to have a<br>
thorough code review with future systems in mind, but at the same time it puts us in a<br>
unique position to have early articles on new Apple technology. So we also try to give<br>
you articles as soon as possible after the API for a new technology has frozen. And if we<br>
can, we give you a prerelease version of the new software along with the code on our<br>
CD. These articles may have somewhat shorter legs, but the bulk of the information<br>
should remain accurate for a very long time.
</p>
<p>
In the past we've given you early QuickDraw GX versions and articles; now that<br>
QuickDraw GX has shipped, the two articles on that subject in this issue are only the<br>
most recent in a long line. Also in this issue we're pleased to bring you our first<br>
article on OpenDoc, Apple's new cross-platform compound-document architecture,<br>
even though the final version of OpenDoc will not have shipped by the time you read<br>
this.
</p>
<p>
Further evidence that we're succeeding is that we've again won in the International<br>
Technical Publications Competition of the Society for Technical Communication, this<br>
time the highest award in our category. But nothing would please us more than to hear<br>
from you, the most important judges of all, on what we can do to make <i> develop </i> an even<br>
better publication; please let us know at AppleLink DEVELOP.

<b>Caroline Rose Editor</b>

<p>
<b>CAROLINE ROSE </b>(AppleLink CROSE) As a child, Caroline wrote a one-page<br>
newsletter about the goings-on in her neighborhood; it included news items, a gossip<br>
column, and a comic strip. Her readership was small, and the operation folded after<br>
one issue. She's happy that <i> develop </i> has lasted longer than that, because after various<br>
jobs at Tymshare, NeXT, and Apple as a programmer, writer, editor, and manager, she<br>
feels she's found her niche here. These days when Caroline's not at work she's likely to<br>
be sailing, swimming, jogging, dancing, gardening, or otherwise not being sedentary.<br>
She hopes to live 100 very active years. *
