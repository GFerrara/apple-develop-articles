<i>"Programming for Flexibility: The Open Scripting Architecture" in </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;develop<i> Issue 18</i><br>

<i>application that will enable your AppleScript scripts to share handlers and properties</i><br>
<i>and to support global variables. You'll also learn a way to support inheritance in other</i><br>
<i>OSA languages with just a little extra work.</i>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In Issue 18 of<i>develop</i> , I showed you how to attach scripts to application-domain<br>
objects and how to delegate the handling of Apple events to those scripts. I left you with<br>
a challenge: to figure out how to support global variables and to enable scripts to share<br>
subroutines and handlers. To meet this challenge you need to implement inheritance.<br>
The AppleScript 1.1 API gives you all the necessary calls to implement inheritance in<br>
embedded AppleScript scripts, but not all are documented yet in<i>Inside Macintosh</i> . This<br>
article documents the calls you need and describes an inheritance scheme that relies on<br>
them. 
</p>
<p>
In a nutshell, here's the scheme :
</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide what kind of script inheritance hierarchy to use. </li>
<li>Link your scripts together in an inheritance chain. </li>
<li>Create a shared handlers script to define subroutines and Apple event<br>
handlers that are shared among all scripts. Make this script the parent of all<br>
other scripts in your program, in effect putting it at the end of the inheritance<br>
chain. </li>
<li>Create a global variables script and add this to the start of the inheritance<br>
chain so that it's the first script to receive incoming messages. Save this<br>
script to disk when the program exits and reload it when the program<br>
restarts, so that variables persist. </li>
</ol>
<p>
You can use much the same scheme to implement inheritance in other Open Scripting<br>
Architecture (OSA) languages, but more work is required to link scripts together in<br>
an inheritance chain, and you must forgo the luxury of sharing global variables<br>
between scripts. At the end of this article, the section "Inheritance in Other OSA<br>
Languages" describes the extra work your program must do.
</p>
<p>
The sample program SimpliFace2 on this issue's CD demonstrates the inheritance<br>
mechanisms discussed here. SimpliFace2 is an extension of SimpliFace, the basic<br>
interface builder used to illustrate the article in Issue 18. The SimpliFace2 sample<br>
code has a compile-time flag qUseOSAinheritance, defined in the header file<br>
SimpliFace2Common.h. If this flag is undefined, the program uses the<br>
AppleScript-specific inheritance scheme described in the bulk of this article.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the<br>
flag is defined, SimpliFace2 uses a general-purpose scheme that involves the extra<br>
work outlined in the section on inheritance in other OSA languages. 
</p>
<h2>&nbsp;CHOOSE A SCRIPT INHERITANCE HIERARCHY</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to do is to decide what kind of script inheritance hierarchy to use.<br>
Youcan use a runtime containment hierarchy (like that used by HyperCard and<br>
FaceSpanTM), a class hierarchy (like that used by AgentBuilder), or some hybrid of<br>
the two, as demonstrated by SimpliFace2. Let's look at each of these hierarchy types in<br>
turn. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;FaceSpan (formerly Frontmost) </b> is the interface builder bundled with the<br>
AppleScript 1.1 Software Development Toolkit. Perhaps the best known OSA "client,"<br>
FaceSpan was developed by Lee Buck (of "WindowScript" fame) of Software Designs<br>
Unlimited, Inc. AgentBuilder, from commstalk hq and Full Moon Software Inc., is a<br>
framework for the creation of communications and information-processing agents that<br>
uses embedded OSA scripts to customize agent behavior. *
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Figure 1 shows a runtime containment hierarchy. In this kind of hierarchy, objects<br>
inherit behavior from their containers at run time. In the object containment<br>
hierarchy used by HyperCard, for example, the scripts of buttons and fields within<br>
cards are at the bottom of the hierarchy. Above them are the scripts of the cards that<br>
contain the buttons and fields, and above each card script is the script of the<br>
background that contains the card. Above each background script, in turn, is the script<br>
of the stack that contains all the backgrounds. The handlers in each container's script<br>
are shared by the scripts of all the objects it contains. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Figure 2 shows a class hierarchy. In this kind of hierarchy, objects inherit behavior<br>
from their parent classes. For instance, the behavior of AgentBuilder objects is<br>
defined in an "ancestor" object of each class, which is the parent of all instances of that<br>
class. This permits the standard scripted behavior of object classes to be overridden in<br>
derived class instances.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 2. </b>A class hierarchy
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Figure 3 shows the hybrid script inheritance hierarchy used in SimpliFace2. In<br>
SimpliFace2, the scripts of user-interface objects -- such as windows, labels, and<br>
buttons -- are organized so that they inherit behavior from the runtime containment<br>
hierarchy. However, the script of the application object isn't included in the<br>
inheritance chain for the script of any user-interface object, and the shared handlers<br>
script becomes the ultimate parent of all other scripts. I chose to use this hybrid<br>
hierarchy in order to demonstrate a wider range of techniques, not for any reason<br>
intrinsic to the program design. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The kind of script inheritance hierarchy to use depends on the nature of the messages<br>
being handled in your program. Using a class hierarchy is most appropriate if the<br>
messages are Apple events defined in the program's 'aete' resource. If the incoming<br>
messages are primarily user-defined subroutines being&nbsp;&nbsp;handled inside scripts, using<br>
a runtime containment hierarchy is probably more natural for the scripter.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3. </b>The hybrid script inheritance hierarchy used in SimpliFace2
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Another way to look at this choice is that if you want to enable users to customize your<br>
program's capabilities by attaching scripts to application-domain objects, using a<br>
runtime containment hierarchy isn't always the best idea. Because different<br>
application-domain objects handle the same Apple event message in different ways (in<br>
other words, the semantic meaning of the message differs depending on what object it's<br>
directed at), unwanted side effects could result from an object's handling an Apple<br>
event message intended for a different level in the containment hierarchy. Using a<br>
class hierarchy ensures that messages will be dealt with only by objects of the class<br>
that understands them.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Once you've chosen the type of script inheritance hierarchy most appropriate for<br>
your program, you can link scripts together in an inheritance chain.
</p>
<h2>LINK SCRIPTS IN AN INHERITANCE CHAIN</h2>
<p>
Linking scripts together in an AppleScript inheritance chain is as simple as setting<br>
their parent properties. Before I tell you how to do that, though, let's review a few<br>
facts about script objects and inheritance. As mentioned in the Issue 18 article, a<br>
script context (a script compiled using the AppleScript OSA component) is equivalent<br>
to a script object in the AppleScript language, so everything I say here about script<br>
objects applies to script contexts as well.
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;ABOUT APPLESCRIPT SCRIPT OBJECTS AND INHERITANCE CHAINS</b><br>
Script objects can contain global variables, properties, and handlers for Apple event<br>
messages and subroutine calls. A script object can have as its parent property an<br>
object specifier or another script object. Thus, one script object can become the<br>
parent of another, and the child script object can inherit properties and handlers from<br>
the parent script object. Parent and child script objects are linked together in an<br>
inheritance chain; this is the path from child to parent to grandparent and so on in an<br>
inheritance hierarchy, as illustrated in Figure 4.
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;For (a lot) more on object specifiers, </b>see&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apple Event Objects and You" by<br>
Richard Clark in <i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 10.*
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/236.gif" width="369 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 4. </b>A script inheritance chain
</p>
<p>
An incoming Apple event message is received by the child script object at the start of<br>
the inheritance chain. If AppleScript can't resolve a reference to a handler or variable<br>
name within this script object, it searches through the entire inheritance chain to find<br>
it. The handler or variable is resolved wherever it's found in the inheritance chain.<br>
When a handler continues a message (that is, passes the message to its parent),<br>
AppleScript starts searching in its parent script object. Messages that target objects<br>
outside the program's domain, or that aren't handled anywhere in the script<br>
inheritance chain (such as Apple events defined in the program's 'aete' resource,<br>
which are handled in the program code instead), or that are continued out of the<br>
inheritance chain, are redispatched as Apple events.
</p>
<p>
<b>SETTING A SCRIPT'S PARENT PROPERTY</b><br>
Now that you understand the dynamics of script inheritance, I'll show you how to set a<br>
script's parent property and thus link it to an inheritance chain. In the AppleScript<br>
language, you simply say what you'd like the parent set to, as illustrated here:
</p>
<pre>script mom
    on getName()
        return "Fenella"
    end getName
end script

script toddler
    property parent : mom
    on getName()
        set myMom to continue getName()
        return "Bart, son of " &amp; myMom
    end getName
end script

getName() of toddler --&gt; returns "Bart, son of Fenella"</pre>
<p>
To set the parent of a script context from a programming language, you can use the<br>
AppleScript routine OSASetProperty. This general-purpose routine (defined in the<br>
header file ASDebugging.h, which was added with the AppleScript 1.1 API) accesses<br>
either a predefined property or a user- defined variable, depending on the AEDesc<br>
passed to it. To access a predefined property -- the parent property -- you create a<br>
descriptor of typeProperty (<i>not</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;typeType), specifying the property ID as the data.<br>
The parameters to the call are (1) the scripting component (probably the AppleScript<br>
component), (2) a mode flag (we use the null mode, indicating no special action should<br>
be taken; alternatively, we could instruct AppleScript to replace the property only if<br>
it already exists), (3) the script context ID that's to be changed, (4) the AEDesc, and<br>
(5) the value you're setting the property to, in our case the new parent. The OSA<br>
routine OSAGetProperty performs the converse function: you can use it to inspect the<br>
values of properties and variables.
</p>
<p>
Here's a fragment from SimpliFace2 that sets the parent of a script by calling<br>
OSASetProperty:
</p>
<pre>OSAError    err = noErr;
AEDesc      nameDesc;
DescType    thePropCode = pASParent;

err = AECreateDesc(typeProperty, (Ptr)&amp;thePropCode,
                sizeof(thePropCode), &amp;nameDesc);
if (err == noErr) {
    err = OSASetProperty(scriptingComponent, kOSAModeNull, contextID,
            &amp;nameDesc, newParentID);
    AEDisposeDesc(&amp;nameDesc);
}</pre>
<p>
The structure of the inheritance chain is static; each parent link needs to be set up<br>
only once, as long as no scripts are replaced. The only exception to this is that the<br>
parent property of the global variables script used in SimpliFace2 needs to be set<br>
every time an incoming Apple event message is handled, as I'll explain later. Whenever<br>
a script in the chain is replaced by a new one, the script's OSAID will change and you'll<br>
need to set the parent property in the new script and in its children again.
</p>
<p>
<b>STRIPPING COPIED PARENT SCRIPTS</b><br>
By setting the parent properties of scripts and thus linking them in inheritance<br>
chains, your program limits unnecessary duplication of script objects. Still, when<br>
AppleScript sets the parent of a script, it stores a copy of the script's parent (and of<br>
the parent's parent, and so on) with the original script.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the basis of the trick<br>
that allows SimpliFace to simulate sharing scripts between objects: every script<br>
carries with it a copy of all the scripts it shares. But this is wasteful -- it means<br>
that, for instance, each button script for a window contains a copy of the window's<br>
script, when only one copy is necessary. Because your program is directly controlling<br>
script inheritance chains, you'll want to block this behavior when it loads and stores<br>
scripts. You can do it by specifying the kOSAModeDontStoreParent flag when you call<br>
OSAStore and recreating the inheritance chain when the scripts are reloaded.
</p>
<p>
Listing 1 shows the routine used to set the script property of an object in<br>
SimpliFace2. Note how it's changed from the routine used in SimpliFace: it now strips<br>
the copied parent scripts from the incoming script so that SimpliFace2 can manage the<br>
inheritance chain itself.

<h2>ATTACH SHARED HANDLERS AND GLOBAL VARIABLES<br>
SCRIPTS</h2>
<p>
Now the plot thickens. You're going to use the inheritance chain you've set up to make<br>
it possible for your program's AppleScript scripts to share handlers and properties<br>
and to support global variables.
</p>
<p>
Our strategy, as demonstrated in SimpliFace2, is to attach a shared handlers script to<br>
the application object and a global variables script to the global script administrator<br>
object (which, as in SimpliFace, is responsible for fetching the script attached to<br>
objects and preparing it for execution). The shared handlers script, which as a<br>
convenience for the scripter I've made a property of the application object (in addition<br>
to the application object's attached script), defines common subroutines for all the<br>
object scripts known to the program. This script is added to the end of the inheritance<br>
chain so that it becomes the parent of all other scripts. Globals are created in the<br>
global variables script, which is always inserted at the start of the AppleScript<br>
inheritance chain when an Apple event is handled by a script.
</p>
<p>
Let me explain why the global variables script is necessary. The AppleScript OSA<br>
component creates global variables in the script context that received the current<br>
message, the one at the start of the inheritance chain. If the variables weren't<br>
predefined as properties when the parent script was defined, they won't be visible to<br>
all scripts. But we'd like variables that are declared in handlers with the Global<br>
keyword to be available to handlers in all scripts. We achieve this by adding the global<br>
variables script that we create to the start of the inheritance chain. Thus, the only<br>
script actually to be dispatched messages is the global variables script, and its parent<br>
becomes the currently resolved object's script. Because its parent changes to whatever<br>
is the appropriate script in the inheritance chain, messages are handled by the correct<br>
targets.
</p>
<p>
<b>HOW IT ALL WORKS</b><br>
The AppleScript-only inheritance approach demonstrated in SimpliFace2 works like<br>
this: Whenever the Apple event prehandler receives an event that might be handled in a<br>
script, it tries to resolve the object that should handle it. If it can't resolve an object<br>
it assumes that the application object's script should handle the event instead. It then<br>
attaches the global variables script (the script that receives all incoming events) to<br>
the start of the inheritance chain that ends with the shared handlers script (the parent<br>
of all scripts). In between is the script of the object to which the event was targeted; if<br>
that object is a button or a field in a window, the inheritance chain also contains the<br>
window's script. The result is the inheritance chain shown in Figure 5. 
</p>
<p>
The Apple event prehandler routine in SimpliFace2 calls the global script<br>
administrator object to manage the scripts, as shown in this extract from the<br>
prehandler:
</p>
<pre>TScriptableObject*  theScriptableObj = NULL;
TScriptableObject*  savedParent = NULL;

if (err == noErr &amp;&amp; theToken)
    err = gScriptAdministrator-&gt;GetAttachedScript
            (theToken-&gt;GetTokenObj(), theScriptableObj, savedParent);
if (err == noErr) { // Pass to script for handling.
    if (theScriptableObj)
        err = ExecuteEventInContext(theEvent, theReply,
                 theScriptableObj);
    else
        err = errAEEventNotHandled;
    if (theToken)
        gScriptAdministrator-&gt;ReleaseAttachedScript
            (theToken-&gt;GetTokenObj(), savedParent);
}</pre>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 5. </b>The script inheritance chain used in SimpliFace2
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The script administrator function GetAttachedScript (Listing 2) is responsible for<br>
adding the global variables script to the start of the inheritance chain by setting its<br>
parent to the script of the target object. Here's how it works: First, it asks the<br>
scriptable object that's the target for the Apple event message to deliver its attached<br>
script. If there's no attached script, the parent of the global variables script is set to<br>
be the shared handlers script. If the object does have an attached script, that script<br>
becomes the parent of the global variables script. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Listing 2. </b>TScriptAdministrator::GetAttachedScript
</p>
<pre>OSAError    TScriptAdministrator::GetAttachedScript (
                       TScriptableObject* theObj,
                       TScriptableObject* &amp;useObject,
                       TScriptableObject* &amp;savedParent)
{
    OSAError        err = noErr;
    OSAID           theObjScript = kOSANullScript;
   
    if (theObj)
        theObjScript = theObj-&gt;GetObjScript();
    if (theObjScript != kOSANullScript)
        err = StartUsing(theObj, savedParent);
    else   // If target has no script, new parent is shared handlers.
        err = StartUsing(NULL, savedParent);
    if (err != noErr)
        useObject = NULL;
    else
        useObject = this;   // If OK, return global variables script.
    return err;
}</pre>
<p>
GetAttachedScript returns the ID of the global variables script so that the prehandler<br>
can send the Apple event to the inheritance chain that the script now starts. The global<br>
variables script receives the Apple event message in the function<br>
ExecuteEventInContext, called from the prehandler. The StartUsing function in Listing<br>
3, which is inherited by the script administrator from TScriptableObject, returns the<br>
current parent of the script so that it can be saved for subsequent restoration by the<br>
script administrator function ReleaseAttachedScript. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 3. </b>TScriptableObject::StartUsing
</p>
<pre>OSAError TScriptableObject::SetCurParent
            (TScriptableObject* theParent)
{
    OSAError        err = noErr;
    OSAID           newParentScriptID = GetParentScript();

    if (fAttachedScript != kOSANullScript)
        err = gScriptAdministrator-&gt;SetScriptParent
                  (gScriptingComponent, fAttachedScript,
                   newParentScriptID);
    return err;
}

OSAError TScriptableObject::StartUsing (TScriptableObject* newParent,
                               TScriptableObject* &amp;oldParent)
{
    oldParent = fParentObj;     // Returned in case it must be saved.
    return SetCurParent(newParent);
}</pre>
<p>
The parent of the global variables script must be saved and restored every time the<br>
Apple event prehandler handles an Apple event. This is because Apple events are<br>
dispatched recursively during the execution of scripts: you should assume that any<br>
Apple event handler can be interrupting the processing of another Apple event. For the<br>
same reason, if you need to set the resume/dispatch procedure differently in different<br>
handlers you must carefully save and restore it each time. The sample code in<br>
SimpliFace2 contains examples of how you might do this.
</p>
<p>
SimpliFace2 also shows how you can make global variables persistent, by saving the<br>
global variables script in a script file in the Preferences folder when the program<br>
exits and reloading it when the program starts up again. The code to handle this is in<br>
the script administrator routines SaveGlobalVariables and LoadGlobalVariables. 
</p>
<p>
<b>A RUN HANDLER WRINKLE</b><br>
Be aware of a wrinkle: If you ever intend to dispatch the Run ('oapp') Apple event to an<br>
AppleScript inheritance chain, each script in the chain must contain a continue run<br>
handler. 
</p>
<pre>on run
    continue run
end run</pre>
<p>
The reason for this is that when AppleScript compiles a script into a script context it<br>
collects all the top-level statements in the script (those not contained in any handler)<br>
into a default run handler, so that if the script is simply executed the top-level<br>
statements will run. If there are no top-level statements, an empty run handler is<br>
created. The trouble is, this default handler doesn't realize you want it to continue the<br>
Run message, so the message will be caught and lost in the script, never to be seen<br>
farther along in the inheritance chain. 
</p>
<h2>INHERITANCE IN OTHER OSA LANGUAGES</h2>
<p>
The inheritance scheme just described is specific to AppleScript scripts because it<br>
relies on OSASetProperty to set up the inheritance chain. This call and others in the<br>
AppleScript 1.1 API aren't part of the required OSA API, so not all scripting<br>
components support them. If your program is to support inheritance in scripts<br>
written in other OSA languages, it must take control of the message passing between<br>
scripts in the chain at script execution time. 
</p>
<p>
Your application can do this by simulating, entirely under program control, the<br>
mechanism that AppleScript uses. Messages that aren't handled in a particular script<br>
in the chain are passed along to the next script in the chain. If they're continued out of,<br>
or not handled in, the chain, the program routes them to its standard Apple event<br>
handlers. The drawback to this approach is that scripting becomes a little more rigid,<br>
because handlers are resolved only toward the parent rather than wherever they are<br>
in the chain. The advantage is that it will work with any OSA language that supports the<br>
event handling API and the Subroutine Apple event, which is the message protocol<br>
AppleScript uses to call subroutines.
</p>
<p>
When your program's Apple event prehandler deals with an incoming Apple event<br>
message by passing it to a script, it's responsible for manually redispatching messages<br>
that aren't handled or that are continued along the inheritance chain. The SimpliFace2<br>
routine ExecuteEventInContext (Listing 4) shows how to do this. The first and second<br>
parameters to this routine are the Apple event and reply; the third parameter is the<br>
scriptable object that is to handle the message. This routine is first called from the<br>
prehandler, which passes it the scriptable object that starts the inheritance chain<br>
(the object to which the message was originally sent). The scriptable object has a field<br>
that's a reference to its parent object, which can be read using the accessor function<br>
GetParentObj. If the current object has a parent, the routine sets the OSA<br>
resume/dispatch procedure to be a recursive call to ExecuteEventInContext, passing<br>
the address of the parent object as the reference constant. If the current object doesn't<br>
have a parent (if the end of the chain has been reached), the routine sets the<br>
resume/dispatch procedure to be the program's standard Apple event handler, ignoring<br>
the prehandler. 
</p>
<p>
If the Apple event message isn't handled in the script of the current object, the<br>
routineOSADoEvent returns the error errAEEventNotHandled. At this point you must<br>
manually redispatch the message, mirroring the OSA's resume/dispatch mechanism: if<br>
the current object has a parent, you recursively call ExecuteEventInContext, passing<br>
it the address of the parent object. If you've reached the end of the inheritance chain,<br>
you simply call the program's standard Apple event handler.

<h2>WHERE YOU'VE BEEN, WHERE YOU'RE GOING</h2>
<p>
You've learned that implementing inheritance starts with choosing an appropriate<br>
script inheritance hierarchy. With this hierarchy in mind, you can link scripts in an<br>
inheritance chain, either by setting their parent properties (if you're working only<br>
with embedded AppleScript scripts) or by directly controlling inheritance at script<br>
execution time (if your program needs to support scripts in other OSA languages).<br>
Then you're ready to create a shared handlers script and put it at the end of the<br>
inheritance chain, making it the parent of all scripts, and (if you're working only<br>
with AppleScript scripts) to add a global variables script to the start of the<br>
inheritance chain where it can receive incoming messages and route them to the<br>
correct targets.

You've seen these techniques illustrated by the sample program SimpliFace2. You can<br>
simply drop the classes from SimpliFace2 into your own programs, use them as the<br>
basis of new programs, or use them as a guide to restructuring existing programs.<br>
Armed with the information in this article and its predecessor, you should now be able<br>
to implement an inheritance scheme for scripts in your own software.
