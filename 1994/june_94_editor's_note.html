&nbsp;One thing about magazine publishing: the wheel keeps turning no matter what. There<br>
can be no slips because of problems that crop up or any extra work that needs to be<br>
done; the "to press" date is set way in advance. So for this issue, having to deal with<br>
redesigning our layout and having our&nbsp;&nbsp;technical editor out on jury duty for months,<br>
I've been going crazy. The smiling face you see in this photo is not what I've looked like<br>
for most of the last three months!
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;But enough about me. Let's talk about the redesign.&nbsp;&nbsp;As you've no doubt already noticed,<br>
we've changed<i> develop</i> 's cover to make it look more like those you'll find on<br>
newsstands. We've added an eye-catching strip across the top and moved the article<br>
titles from the right side of the cover to the left, where they would peek out if the<br>
issues were stacked from left to right (imagine offset&nbsp;&nbsp;overlapping windows). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;We've changed the layout in the inside to fit a bit more on each page. Issues of <i> develop</i><br>
will be&nbsp;&nbsp;slimmer than before, but you'll still be getting the same amount of content. We<br>
couldn't resist tweaking a few other things while we were at it. Specifically, "listing<br>
boxes" now help keep code together in one tidy place. But we still put code close to<br>
where it's discussed, and we still place code in the body of the article if that makes<br>
more sense.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Another change in this issue is a direct result of the aforementioned jury duty: Dave<br>
Johnson's&nbsp;&nbsp;popular Veteran Neophyte column is missing. But don't worry; it will<br>
return once justice has been served. Meanwhile we do have two new columns: Balance<br>
of Power, with PowerPC TM-related tidbits from Dave Evans, and Newton&nbsp;&nbsp;Q &amp; A,<br>
which lets you interrogate a llama and receive a T-shirt if he uses your question.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;As always, we'd like your feedback. There will be more changes to come, and we really<br>
want to know what works for you and what doesn't. So please, don't just gripe (or sing<br>
our praises) among&nbsp;&nbsp;yourselves; drop us a line and give us your $.02! All information<br>
about who to contact for what is now located in one handy place, on the inside front<br>
cover (along with other irresistible tweaks).
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;By letting us know how we can improve, you help us win awards like the one that we<br>
learned of while working on this issue: an Award of Distinction, and Best of Category<br>
(Monthly or Quarterly Magazines), in the Society for Technical Communication's<br>
1993 Northern California Technical Publications Competition. So thanks, and please<br>
keep it coming!

<b>&nbsp;Caroline Rose</b><br>
<b>Editor</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>CAROLINE ROSE </b>(AppleLink CROSE) was part of a huge East-to-West Coast<br>
migration that took place one heady summer many years ago. She stumbled upon a<br>
technical writing job and took&nbsp;&nbsp;to it and to California like a programmer to Mountain<br>
Dew. She's been a programmer herself (at Tymshare) and even a manager (at NeXT),<br>
but marks her favorite work years as those spent writing and editing at Apple -- first<br>
<i>&nbsp;Inside Macintosh</i> and later <i>develop</i> . To keep herself sane outside of work, Caroline has<br>
little do with computers and has been known to stop making sense. She does, however,<br>
keep her wits honed for Scrabble. *
