<b>MISSING GAME FOLDER</b><br>
The column by Brigham Stevens on game development in <i> develop </i> Issue 17 refers to a<br>
Game Development folder on the Bookmark 17 CD. I was unable to locate the folder. Is<br>
it me, or was there a production glitch?<br>
<p>
Also, is the folder the same one that was on the February Developer CD?<br>
-- Bob Boonstra
</p>
<p>
<i>There was a production glitch. The folder was on Issue 16's Bookmark CD but was</i><br>
<i>inadvertently removed from Issue 17's CD. We have since restored it (it's in the Tools</i><br>
<i>&amp; Applications folder). We also got the name wrong: it's Games, not Game Development.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>And yes, it's the same folder as the one on the Developer CD. The Bookmark CD always</i><br>
<i>contains a subset of the Developer CD Series. Happy gaming!</i><br>

<b>DEVELOP ON THE SMALL SCREEN</b><br>
In Issue 17 you ask why so many applications lack common sense, and then you go on to<br>
list a number of annoyances caused by bad designs. I agree that the items mentioned<br>
could&nbsp;&nbsp;be better handled, but I have a similar complaint with <i> develop</i>!
</p>
<p>
<i>develop</i> , shipped on CD-ROM with Apple DocViewer, is a software product that's<br>
produced like a printed document. Things like double-columned pages are extremely<br>
difficult to read on a standard Macintosh 13-inch monitor -- you have to scroll down<br>
the entire page as you read a single column and then scroll back up and repeat the<br>
process. While this orientation makes sense on a printed page, it really bites on my<br>
13-inch monitor. Also, <i> develop </i> is nearly unreadable with its serif typefaces, italics,<br>
etc.
</p>
<p>
Right now you're probably shaking your head and saying that you don't have the money<br>
to produce two versions of <i>develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;-- one for print and one for CD. If so, then you also<br>
know why so many applications lack common sense!<br>
-- Brooks Bell
</p>
<p>
<i>Certainly time and money do enter into design decisions, even at Apple. But there are</i><br>
<i>still a lot of cases where common sense could be followed without a big hit to the</i><br>
<i>schedule or pocketbook.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Regarding your problem with viewing the CD version of </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;develop <i>on a 13-inch screen,</i><br>
<i>you might try DocViewer's "text" view (the icon in the tool bar that looks like a sheet</i><br>
<i>of paper with writing, just to the left of the scaling pop-up menu). This view gets rid </i><br>
<i>of all special formatting such as double columns. You can still look at illustrations, by</i><br>
<i>clicking the Open button next to the figure caption.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>In text view you can change the font size and type of any structural part of the</i><br>
<i>document, using the Format command in the Edit menu. For example, you can choose</i><br>
<i>Body in the Format dialog and change the font of all the body text. (In the normal view,</i><br>
<i>the scaling pop-up menu can be used to magnify everything.)</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for writing and giving us the opportunity to provide these tips. We welcome all</i><br>
<i>gripes!</i><br>

<b>QUICKDRAW GX MORPH TABLES</b><br>
The Macintosh Q&amp;A section of <i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 16 stated that there's no way to&nbsp;&nbsp;do an<br>
automatic checksum digit insertion using QuickDraw GX's glyph metamorphosis tables.<br>
I haven't read much about QuickDraw GX's 'mort' tables, but I do know finite state<br>
tables. It's quite feasible to build a 12-state table that will generate a checksum digit<br>
for a digit-string of any length.The key is to make the checksum be calculated<br>
dynamically instead of at the end. This reduces the required number of states to ten,<br>
plus beginning and end, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;well within the limits of QuickDraw GX.<br>
-- Mark Cogan Developer Wannabe
</p>
<p>
<i>You're quite right; you can indeed use morph tables to generate checksums. Other</i><br>
<i>cyclic kinds of calculations are also possible; for example, a morph table could be set</i><br>
<i>up to do pseudo-random selection of letterforms from a font that was designed with</i><br>
<i>five variant forms of A-Z and a-z. When a letter is encountered, it would be replaced</i><br>
<i>with its version from one of the sets. But regardless of the specific glyph, each time a</i><br>
<i>glyph is processed the state advances and eventually loops back to the starting state.</i><br>
<i>This is in general the template for how cyclic effects can be implemented with the</i><br>
<i>QuickDraw GX morph tables.</i><br>

<b>WATCH-CURSOR PUSH-UPS AND BEYOND</b><br>
Regarding Dave Johnson's bio in Issue&nbsp;&nbsp;16: He's not the only one who plays with the<br>
cursor while waiting for the Mac. Here are some other silly things to do:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to fit the watch inside an empty horizontal scroll bar. It always<br>
overlaps one of the lines, either the top or bottom one, so if you move that<br>
single pixel that alternates between them, the watch seems to be slipping on<br>
its wrist belt.</li>
<li>While installing the system, position the counting hand so that it's just<br>
touching a horizontal line. Don't overlap the line, and the hand will seem to be<br>
cut from its owner, instead of being a ghost unterminated hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>
-- Javier Guerra G.
</p>
<p>
Dave is not alone in doing watch-cursor push-ups and pull-ups. My personal favorite<br>
activity here is trying to find a place where I can do both at once. I remember that the<br>
old Font/DA Mover has a spot between two buttons where you can do that nicely.<br>
-- Maarten Hazewinkel
</p>
<p>
<i>Hot Dawg! I knew there were others out there doing the watch cursor thing. I've heard</i><br>
<i>from a half dozen or so; it's a lot more common than I thought.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I remember doing that with the old Font/DA Mover, too. The progress bar during long</i><br>
<i>Finder operations also worked well. (Nowadays we have movable modal progress</i><br>
<i>windows, so the watch cursor is gone -- the price of progress.)</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for letting me know I'm not alone!</i><br>

<b>UNABASHED PRAISE</b><br>
<i>develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;is an inspiring magazine. The layout is clean yet warm and inviting. The<br>
articles are relevant and the authors are knowlegeable.
</p>
<p>
The on-line issues of <i>develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;are invaluable. This is the best on-line documentation I<br>
have seen, period. The articles look great -- just like the magazine. And searching and<br>
setting filters is fast. Microsoft's CD comes with a lot of files, but most of it is old,<br>
irrelevant, and ugly to read.
</p>
<p>
I sure appreciate your effort.<br>
-- Brent Foust

<i>We can't thank you enough for taking the time to write. Letters like this keep us going,</i><br>
<i>in more ways than one. We hope you're as happy with the recent changes to our layout;</i><br>
<i>please let us know if not.-- Caroline Rose</i>
