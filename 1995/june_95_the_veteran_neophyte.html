<p>
I've been juggling seriously since the summer of 1979, when I saw a performance of<br>
the Pickle Family Circus in a park one gorgeous Saturday afternoon. I already knew<br>
how to juggle three balls -- shakily -- but that was the day I<i>really</i> discovered<br>
juggling. I had never seen clubs juggled up close and in person before (clubs are those<br>
bowling pin-like things that are thrownspinning end over end through the air), and in<br>
particular I had never seen jugglers throw things back and forth between each other<br>
(called<i>passing</i> ). The Pickle Family did lots of both. 
</p>
<p>
I was stunned. I was bowled over. I was frozen in myseat, gaping and incredulous. I<br>
couldn't believe that what I was seeing was possible. I<i>had</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;to learn how to do that. 
</p>
<p>
Fortuitously, the circus offered workshops in various circus arts, including juggling,<br>
so I immediately signed up. The following morning, I learned the basics of passing<br>
balls, forced my roommate to learn to juggle three balls so that I'd have someone to try<br>
it out with,and embarked on a long and fruitful juggling binge. Thefire that was lit that<br>
day burned white hot for over fiveyears, and will remain fitfully smoldering as long as<br>
I canstill lift my arms, close my fingers, and count to 3. 
</p>
<p>
My favorite kind of juggling nowadays is getting together with other jugglers and<br>
passing clubs. We arrange ourselves in various formations about the floor, start<br>
juggling all together, and throw the juggling clubs back and forth in varied and<br>
complex -- but mostly predetermined -- ways. 
</p>
<p>
Which brings me to the main topic of this column: how multiperson juggling patterns<br>
work, and one way to write them down on paper. I'm going dangerouslyfar out on a limb<br>
here, assuming that it will be interestingto you, even though it has precious little to do<br>
with programming computers, and even though you're probably not a juggler. This<br>
particular limb is propped up a little by the very high proportion of computer people,<br>
mathematicians, engineers, and other scientists among jugglers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(There have been<br>
long-winded and unresolved discussions about why this should be so, but whatever the<br>
reason, it's a fact.) It's also been my observation (at Apple at our weekly juggle, and at<br>
the Worldwide Developers Conference) that computer people, in their endearing<br>
analytical way, often stand around for a long time trying to figure out the patterns. 
</p>
<p>
Once you understand the rules of how the objects interleave and the jugglers<br>
interconnect, you can search for new patterns on paper, whether or not you know how<br>
to juggle. It's like a puzzle, or like a mathematical game. It's even conceivable (though<br>
just barely) that a knowledge of juggling patterns could be useful to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a<br>
citation on the rec.juggling newsgroup a while back for a paper called "Juggling<br>
Networks," published in the proceedings of a conference on parallel and distributed<br>
computing. From the abstract:
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;. . . these constructions are based on a metaphor involving teams of jugglers whose</i><br>
<i>throwing, catching, and passing patterns result in intricate permutations of the balls.</i><br>
<i>This metaphor affords a convenient visualization of time-division-multiplex</i><br>
<i>activities that should be of value in devising networks for a variety of switching tasks.</i>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
There have been several mathematical papers that deal with juggling in one way or<br>
another, and even so eminent a personage as Claude Shannon, the father of information<br>
theory, was an amateur juggler and was interested in the permutations and<br>
combinations in juggling patterns. He wrote a paper called "The Scientific Aspects of<br>
Juggling," and I heard that when he appeared at a juggling convention he drew<br>
thunderous applause from the assembled jugglers (another indication of how many<br>
jugglers are science types). 
</p>
<p>
Club passing is by far my favorite kind of juggling. The jollies I get from it are all<br>
over the map; it's deeply satisfying for me on many, many levels. Part of it is social,<br>
of course. Like sex, it's just more fun with others. And a big part of it is the<br>
cooperation, being a part of this complicated group pattern that's built and maintained<br>
by everyone together. I suspect it's a lot like jamming with a band in that sense: we all<br>
agree on a framework -- 12-bar blues in E or a seven-club four-count with triples,<br>
as the case may be -- and then go for it, the members either struggling to keep up or<br>
embellishing wildly, according to their level of skill. Sometimes we'll hit a "groove," a<br>
day and a pattern and a distribution of people that just feels right, the beat solid, the<br>
hands sure of their grip. 
</p>
<p>
Club passing can feel like being part of some giant, whirling, clockwork contraption,<br>
with everything ticking and clacking along. Talk about being a cog in the machine! The<br>
spinning clubs form this sort of living, writhing, flying tangle with its own weird<br>
existence, a kind of "energy net" connecting the jugglers involved. The old saw "what<br>
goes around comes around" has a particularly pointed truth in club passing: if one<br>
juggler throws a pass badly -- say without quite enough spin, or a little off target --<br>
it causes the receiving juggler some, well, discomfort. That discomfort often manifests<br>
itself in another bad pass, causing the next receiver to struggle, and so on. It's often<br>
actually visible; you can see the disturbance making the rounds, until it either gets<br>
smoothed out by jugglers who manage to keep their cool, or amplifies itself so badly<br>
that the whole pattern comes crashing down around the jugglers' heads. (Interestingly,<br>
the disturbance often travels independently of the clubs themselves, in a different<br>
direction or at a different speed, like a wave passing through water.) And passing clubs<br>
fosters --<i>requires</i> , actually -- a sort of heightened awareness of the other people<br>
involved. Often a quick, nearly imperceptible motion on the part of one juggler, a tiny<br>
hesitation, or the beginning of a wrong throw, corrected almost before it happens,<br>
causes another juggler to react reflexively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically both burst out laughing, mostly<br>
because it's unbelievable that such a tiny signal is transmitted at all. 
</p>
<p>
And then there's the patterns game: a significant portion of the time spent "juggling" is<br>
really spent standing around, fiddling with the clubs, and trying to come up with new<br>
formations, new ways to arrange ourselves and the clubs in space and time so that<br>
everything fits together. The landscape of possible patterns is vast and complex, but<br>
also highly structured in mysterious ways. As in other iterative systems (computers<br>
and economies spring to mind), the underlying rules are relatively simple but the<br>
results can be very complex and widely variable. It's a kind of combinatorics and is, I<br>
think, actually covered by the mathematics of group theory. 
</p>
<p>
I wrote a computer program that implements one particular kind of juggling notation,<br>
introduced to me by a juggler named Martin Frost and known as<i>causal diagramming</i> .<br>
This notation can be handy for doodling around trying to find new multiperson passing<br>
patterns. (Actually, I<i>started</i> writing the program. It's still rickety and unfinished, and<br>
will probably always remain so -- it was more an experiment in QuickDraw GX<br>
programming than anything else. Nevertheless, it's included on this issue's CD, for<br>
your edification and/or derision.) The program implements a kind of active graph<br>
paper, allowing you to draw only "legal" throws, and constraining your diagrams in<br>
appropriate ways (such as preventing you from drawing throws that go back in time,<br>
for a start). 
</p>
<p>
Figure 1 shows the diagram for a juggler doing a basic three-object pattern (called<br>
a<i>cascade</i> ), and will serve to show both how the notation works and how juggling<br>
works. First the diagram: Time marches off inexorably to the right, divided into nice,<br>
even steps (called<i>counts</i> ). A juggler is represented through time as a row of Ls and<br>
Rs, representing the juggler's left and right hands, alternately throwing things. A<br>
thrown object is represented by an arrow from the hand that throws it to the hand that<br>
catches it. The pattern wraps around at the dotted lines, and repeats endlessly -- or<br>
until someone drops something. (The program always shows two repeating cycles like<br>
this, with the repeated parts "faded.") Note that the arrows (throws) form an<br>
unbroken line traveling through time from left to right, and that each hand has exactly<br>
one "input" and one "output."
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1. </b>A three-object juggle
</p>
<p>
Contrary to what you might think at first glance, the overall path the arrows make<br>
doesn't directly trace the path of an individual club. If it did, this would just be a<br>
diagram of throwing one club back and forth between two hands. (That's a necessary<br>
prerequisite to juggling, but is definitely <i>not</i> juggling.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, each throw<i>displaces</i><br>
a club that is always assumed to be held, waiting,in the receiving hand. Think of the<br>
juggler as holding a club in each hand, while the third is in the air. The incoming club<br>
displaces the club that's already there, forcing the juggler to throw it elsewhere. In a<br>
cascade, the displaced club is thrown back to the opposite hand, where it in turn<br>
displaces the club that's there, which goes back to the first hand, displacing the club<br>
that's there, and so on, ad infinitum. (Note that although I'm saying "club" here, all<br>
these principles apply equally well to balls or rings or rubber chickens.) So the chain<br>
of throws is really a conceptual one, not a material one; it's a chain of cause and effect<br>
through time. 
</p>
<p>
Figure 2 shows two jugglers passing with each other (the repeated cycle was cropped<br>
for space reasons). Note that they juggle in time with each other, like musicians<br>
keeping a beat. (When juggling with clubs, you actually<i>hear</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;the beat, when the clubs<br>
slap into the jugglers' hands.) Both jugglers throw a club to each other at the same<br>
time, both from the right hand (though it could just as well be the left). Throwing a<br>
club to another juggler "breaks" the juggler's continuous line of throws, but the other<br>
juggler's club arrives in the nick of time, knitting the pattern back together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is<br>
a requirement: any club thrown to another juggler must be replaced by an incoming<br>
one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, juggling can't continue; the juggler just stops, a club in each hand,<br>
waiting. (Actually, there are common situations that force a juggler to "stall" like that<br>
for a count or two, but we'll limit ourselves to the nonstalling patterns here.)
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2. </b>A four-count
</p>
<p>
Because of the close timing, both jugglers must agree on the pattern before starting.<br>
The pattern in Figure 2 is called a<i>four-count</i> because there's a pass every four counts.<br>
(Another name for this pattern is<i> every other</i> , referring to the fact that every other<br>
right-hand throw is a pass.) The four-count is a very common pattern, and for most<br>
club jugglers this is the default, "idling" pattern. Since there's so much time between<br>
passes, it's possible to do lots of fancy free-form tricks (affectionately known as<br>
"throwing trash") in the midst of the pattern. Of course, "so much time" isn't really<br>
much time at all: a club juggle is roughly 160 counts per minute, so there's just over<br>
a second between the passes in a four-count. 
</p>
<p>
These diagrams show nothing about spatial relationships,by the way. The usual<br>
situation has the jugglers facing each other 6 or 8 feet apart, but the same patterns<br>
can be done standing side by side, back to back, or even with one juggler standing on<br>
the other's shoulders. These diagrams show only the "connectedness" of the pattern<br>
through time, and in fact you can draw patterns that work fine on paper but are<br>
difficult to actually do because of mid-air collisions. 
</p>
<p>
Figure 3 shows another pattern that demonstrates some other important concepts. In<br>
this case, every right-hand throw is a pass (which makes this pattern a<i>two-count</i> ).<br>
Although the jugglers are juggling to the same beat, note that they are out of sync; one<br>
juggler's right-hand throw is simultaneous with the other's left. Note also that each<br>
pass spends twice as long -- two counts -- in the air. In all the previous diagrams,<br>
the throws have been<i>singles</i> , meaning that the club spins around once during transit.<br>
The passes in Figure 3 are<i>doubles;</i> since they're in the air twice as long, they have<br>
time to spin around twice before being caught. (The left-hand "self" throws are still<br>
singles.)
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3. </b>A two-count with right-handed doubles
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
A warning about these multiple-spin throws: It's tempting, on paper, to make heavy<br>
use of long arrows (throws that spend lots of time in the air between jugglers). A<br>
little physics tells you, though, that the time in the air is proportional to the height of<br>
the throw<i>squared</i> . So a double needs to be thrown four times the height of a single, and<br>
a triple must thrown nine times higher. A quadruple -- a "quad" -- must be<i>sixteen</i><br>
<i>times</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;the height of a single, and that's about as far as you can reasonably go with any<br>
sort of accuracy (or safety!). I generally stop at triples. 
</p>
<p>
Now take a look at Figure 4 (again, cropped for space). This shows a three-person<br>
pattern called a<i>feed</i> . In this case one person (juggler 2) acts as the <i>feeder</i> and the<br>
others are <i>feedees</i> . The feeder is passing twice as often as the feedees; the feeder is<br>
doing a two-count, while the feedees are each doing a four-count, interleaved with each<br>
other in time. The feeder switches back and forth between the two feedees. This is<br>
another very common pattern, and can be added to indefinitely: Juggler 3 could pass<br>
with a new juggler, juggler 4, on the first count, at the same time jugglers 1 and 2<br>
are exchanging clubs. That makes juggler 3 a feeder as well, feeding 2 and 4.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 4. </b>A feed
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I think by now you can see how the patterns fit together. It's like building a network,<br>
where everything has to eventually connect up and balance out. Go ahead, give it a try.<br>
A favorite pattern of mine is a three-count, with a pass every third count; both left<br>
and right hands pass. How about a feed where the feedees do three-counts? How many<br>
three-count feedees can one feeder possibly handle?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try a ten-club feed (the feeder<br>
does two-count doubles, as in Figure 3, and the feedees each do four- count doubles).<br>
Admire the attractive and tidy braids that result. Go wild.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some interesting<br>
and&nbsp;&nbsp;nonobvious things about this notation that are probably worth pointing out. You<br>
can tell how many clubs there are in a pattern by taking a vertical slice through the<br>
diagram anywhere, counting the throws you intersect, and adding two clubs per<br>
juggler. (Note that Figure 3 is a seven-club pattern!) Also, if you start anywhere and<br>
follow the line of arrows around, wrapping back at the first dotted line, they always<br>
form closed paths, eventually arriving back where they began. Some patterns form one<br>
long continuous cycle; they're knit from a single strand, like a sweater. All the<br>
examples here are like that. Other patterns form distinct "orbits," where there are<br>
two or more strands making up the pattern; the three-count is an example. Each<br>
strand is an independent line of cause and effect, really an independent subpattern, that<br>
has no effect on the other parts of the pattern. You can actually decompose such<br>
patterns into their constituent parts, and juggle just one strand of the pattern at a<br>
time. 
</p>
<p>
Also, the fate of any particular club isn't obvious at all in these diagrams. You can<br>
trace it, if you like -- a club leaves a hand two counts after it arrives -- but it's a bit<br>
of a pain (hmm, that might make a good addition to the program). Of course, tracing<br>
the paths of individual clubs isn't of primary interest to jugglers (though it's fun<br>
sometimes), in the same way that the path of an individual dollar is rarely of interest<br>
to economists and the trials and tribulations of an individual electron don't concern<br>
circuit designers. In contrast, I'd bet that the paths of the individual clubs are of<i>great</i><br>
interest to the folks who wrote the network paper cited earlier. This notation would<br>
probably be a poor choice for them. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, of course, the<i>experience</i> of juggling is nowhere to be found in these diagrams.<br>
In contrast to their clean, orderly lines, passing clubs is a very physical thing, full of<br>
grimacing effort, plagued with fumbling and mistakes, and occasionally<br>
bone-whackingly painful. It's more like chopping wood than like doing math; it's more<br>
like pounding nails than like tying macram&#201;, despite the nice braided look of the<br>
diagrams. But when things get cooking, when everyone is warmed up and throwing<br>
well, when the pattern grows and takes shape between our hands and fills the air with<br>
intricate, swirling, impossible motion, there's nothing else quite like it in the world.
