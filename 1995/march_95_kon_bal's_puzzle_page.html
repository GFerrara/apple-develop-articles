</p>
<p>
Josh Hey, KON, where's BAL?
</p>
<p>
KON Hmmm. That's a good one. Have you checked all the usual places: his cube? the<br>
fitness center? prison?
</p>
<p>
Josh No sign. He won't even return my calls.
</p>
<p>
KON Maybe his answering machine is on the fritz?
</p>
<p>
Josh Hold on! Finding BAL was not the puzzle I had in mind.
</p>
<p>
KON Well, I hope this is an easy one if I have to go it alone.
</p>
<p>
Josh It's right up your alley. Let's see if all that Sega programming has made you soft.<br>
I have a Mac IIci with 8 MB of RAM, a late alpha version of System 7.5, QuickDraw GX<br>
beta 3 . . .
</p>
<p>
KON Hold on, hold on! There's the problem! Swap hard drives with a machine that has<br>
working system software, and your bug, whatever it is, goes away. While you're at it,<br>
why don't you buy a Mac with a little more horsepower?
</p>
<p>
Josh Not so easy, KON. We're here to solve these problems, to "learn some&nbsp;&nbsp;valuable<br>
debugging techniques," remember? Anyway, I'm printing&nbsp;&nbsp;from Deneba's Canvas to a<br>
LaserWriter Pro 630. My machine gets a bus error while spooling a nasty sample<br>
document consisting of a bunch of Ferrari F40s that Lance thoughtfully duplicated and<br>
rotated in Canvas.
</p>
<p>
KON OK, let's isolate the offender here. What happens if you install GX beta 3 on the<br>
IIci running System 7.1?
</p>
<p>
Josh The problem goes away; the document prints beautifully. You even get all those<br>
cool GX printing features, like document redirection and printing extensions. Don't you<br>
just love it?
</p>
<p>
KON It's great! I can't wait to install it. How about some more information about the<br>
crash?
</p>
<p>
Josh What? You haven't figured it out yet? OK, I'll be nice, since BAL is hiding out.<br>
Let's install a debugging version of the beta 3 GX Graphics INIT, and see what we can<br>
find. I'll be even nicer and give you a version with MacsBug symbols.
</p>
<p>
KON So where's the crash?
</p>
<p>
<b>100</b> Josh It looks like we don't crash in GX itself. MacsBug heap checks reveal nothing<br>
amiss in any heap. But we crash in a <b> CMP.W (A2), D0</b> instruction, with A2 looking<br>
like garbage. What next?
</p>
<p>
KON How about a <b>wh pc</b> MacsBug command to see where we are?
</p>
<p>
<b>90</b> Josh The PC is 1270 bytes into a locked, purgeable, relocatable block in the<br>
system heap. The block even consists of legitimate code! It's about 16K long, if that's<br>
any help to you. A stack crawl reveals no interesting MacsBug symbols, just to make<br>
things even tastier.
</p>
<p>
KON OK, let's try to figure out who owns this block. Find the beginning of the block and<br>
use <b>dm </b>to look around. Any clues?
</p>
<p>
Josh Nothing obvious, like the programmer's name and phone number. Only a few<br>
cowboys like you would leave such a nice trail. I do notice some four-letter constants<br>
near the top, like 'mach', 'fpu ', and 'qd ', but overall the block looks like a bunch of<br>
680x0 opcodes, as one would expect.
</p>
<p>
KON All right, let's use <b>il</b> to look around the block and see if we can find any telltale<br>
traps. Maybe from there we can guess what sort of code this is, or even who owns it.
</p>
<p>
<b>80</b> Josh Besides the smattering of Gestalts, HLocks, HUnlocks, and GetTrapAddress<br>
traps, I notice a _ComponentDispatch and a _SetComponentInstanceStorage call.<br>
Overall, this code has very few traps, and lots of computational code.
</p>
<p>
KON I was told there would be no math! This code sounds like a Component<br>
Manager-based code resource that went amuck. Given that we're dealing with printing<br>
from GX, I'd guess it's ColorSync and not QuickTime. Let's be skanky and see how we got<br>
into this wonderful code. Move the PC to the end of the function, and step us out of here.<br>
What do we find?
</p>
<p>
<b>70</b> Josh Getting warmer! After walking our way out of here in MacsBug by placing the<br>
PC near the end of each function and tracing over the UNLK A6 and RTS instructions,<br>
we discover that we are in fact inside a component called by ColorSync! Continuing to<br>
step out in this fashion reveals that the trap that was called was _ColorMatch. Didn't<br>
you write some of the slime we're looking at now?
</p>
<p>
KON Nothing doing. It's clearly a GX bug, just like the one from the last Puzzle Page.<br>
You GX people like to pawn off your problems on everyone else. What else can you tell<br>
me?
</p>
<p>
<b>60</b> Josh OK, since I wrote much of the lovely code that has GX calling ColorSync, I'll<br>
even lend a hand. Let's restart and do an <b> atb ColorMatch</b> and see what happens. After<br>
setting this up, we discover that GX calls ColorSync to convert some colors from RGB<br>
to CMYK. The data it passes to CWNewColorWorld looks fine -- it's merely the 14-<br>
inch Macintosh Color Display color profile. ColorSync returns noErr, and we later<br>
crash when we actually try to match a color using CWMatchColors.
</p>
<p>
KON What version of ColorSync are you running?
</p>
<p>
<b>50</b> Josh 1.0.4. It's the one where the code that actually does color matching has been<br>
brought native for PowerPC. The folks over in Imaging told me&nbsp;&nbsp;that all they did was<br>
massage the code slightly to compile for PowerPC. I hear those IBM compilers are a<br>
little stricter than THINK C when it comes to ANSI compliance.
</p>
<p>
KON Does it work with 1.0.3?
</p>
<p>
Josh Yep.
</p>
<p>
KON Hmmm. So what you're saying is we're crashing in ColorSync when printing<br>
under GX and System 7.5 to the LaserWriter from Canvas, but it works fine in System<br>
7.1. I'd love to blame the whole thing on 7.5 and call it a day, but the code that dies<br>
only makes very standard system calls, which factors the 7.5 code out of the equation.<br>
And ColorSync 1.0.3 works. So the problem seems to be with ColorSync 1.0.4. Any<br>
other changes for 1.0.4?
</p>
<p>
<b>40</b> Josh Since GX relies on ColorSync, we need to know whether it's installed before<br>
we install GX and patch out all of the Printing Manager. System 7 loads extensions<br>
before INITs in control panels, so I talked the ColorSync guys into making the INIT part<br>
of ColorSync live in a separate extension file from the profile picker, which remains<br>
in the control panel. Cool, huh?
</p>
<p>
KON Wonderful. Now the user has twice the chance of throwing the darn thing away,<br>
right after getting rid of A/ROSE and DAL. I guess it would be too hard to solve that<br>
problem right, and search the Control Panels folder for ColorSync and determine<br>
whether or not it's going to load. Now you've created another weird, order-dependent<br>
nightmare on the Macintosh. It should give you job security, if nothing else.
</p>
<p>
Josh Good point, KON. I suppose GX should be clairvoyant and know that ColorSync will<br>
load just because it's in the Control Panels folder. Next thing you know, those<br>
extension-disabling utilities would be patching the File Manager so that GX's INIT code<br>
doesn't find ColorSync when the user disables it.
</p>
<p>
KON All right, all right. So what does the crashing code look like it's trying to do?<br>
Where did this horrible A2 value come from?
</p>
<p>
<b>35</b> Josh ColorSync gets this value out of the middle of a relocatable block in<br>
MultiFinder temp memory. From the disassembly, my guess is that it's doing a lookup<br>
in a hash table of some form.
</p>
<p>
KON Ah, yes. To speed things up, the matching code remembers recent colors. This way<br>
we can avoid a whole lot of math. But why would the block be in MultiFinder temp<br>
memory? When ColorSync allocates memory, it first tries the current heap and<br>
system heap, and only if there's not enough space in either of those does it allocate the<br>
block in MultiFinder temp memory. This seems to imply that you're low on memory.
</p>
<p>
<b>30</b> Josh Well, it's just the system heap that's low. Because GX Graphics doesn't want to<br>
move application heap memory, it sets the current heap to the system heap before<br>
calling ColorSync.
</p>
<p>
KON It's no surprise that you're low on memory. You have all that System 7.5 garbage<br>
floating around in your machine. Tell me more about that block it got the erroneous<br>
pointer from.
</p>
<p>
<b>25</b> Josh It's 10,054 bytes big, and from the look of things, it's full of trash. I wonder<br>
who's ruining it?
</p>
<p>
KON Let's see. When GX calls CWNewCWorld, ColorSync sets up some memory. Reboot<br>
and break on _ColorMatch; once we hit that, break on TempNewHandle. After the<br>
TempNewHandle, let's step-spy to see who trashes the location. As long as the block<br>
doesn't move, we should find out who's ruining our hash table.
</p>
<p>
<b>20</b> Josh A step-spy on a location in a relocatable block? I've got good news and bad<br>
news. The good news is that the block doesn't relocate between the allocation and the<br>
crash, so the step-spy trick is valid. The bad news is that the step-spy doesn't catch<br>
anyone trashing our location.
</p>
<p>
KON Wait! The location isn't touched <i> at all</i> ? As in "uninitialized"? How can that be?<br>
Right after calling TempNewHandle, I clear out the entire block to 0. What happened<br>
here?
</p>
<p>
<b>15</b> Josh You're getting warmer! Here's a listing of the code right after<br>
TempNewHandle:
</p>
<pre>MOVE.L     D7,-(A7)
CLR.L       -(A7)
MOVE.L      (A3),-(A7)
JSR         *-$3B70</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;KON That looks right. Let's step into the JSR and see what happens.
</p>
<p>
<b>10</b> Josh It looks like a simple routine. In fact, it's right out of Symantec's ANSI<br>
library:
</p>
<pre>MOVE.L      $0004(A7),D0
MOVEA.L     D0,A0
MOVE.B      $0009(A7),D1
MOVE.L      $000A(A7),D2
BRA.S       *+$0006
MOVE.B      D1,(A0)+
SUBQ.L      #$1,D2
BNE.S       *-$0004
RTS</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;Single-stepping through here reveals that nothing really happens at all. It loads D0<br>
with a pointer to our block, D1 gets 0, and D2 gets 0. It branches to the BNE; then the<br>
BNE doesn't loop. Whoops! I bet you wanted to clear a few more bytes than that! KON<br>
How did we end up there? I never even linked with the ANSI libraries back in the 1.0<br>
days! And how did someone screw this up? Let's call up Symantec and scream at them<br>
for a while.
</p>
<p>
<b>5</b> Josh Not so fast! Let's look at the prototype for <b> memset</b>. It can be found in string.h<br>
in the C headers folder somewhere deep in the Symantec C++ folder hierarchy. It reads<br>
like this:
</p>
<pre> void *memset(void *, int, size_t);</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;It looks like ColorSync thinks that the int is 4 bytes long! After pushing things on the<br>
stack, what we've got is what you see on the left here, but <b> memset </b>expects the stack<br>
to look like what you see on the right. What's wrong with this picture?
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/142.gif" width="432 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
KON Of course! The THINK ANSI library comes with the "4-byte ints" option disabled.<br>
When taking the matching code native, someone must have decided to make the 680x0<br>
build look as much like the PowerPC build as possible and turned "4-byte ints" on, but<br>
didn't rebuild the libraries linked with the code. How does ColorSync 1.0.4 ever work<br>
at all on a 680x0 Mac?
</p>
<p>
Josh Good question, KON! Looking around the TempNewHandle call, we see that<br>
ColorSync allocates a handle in one of three ways: with&nbsp;&nbsp;NewHandleClear, with<br>
NewHandleSysClear, or with TempNewHandle followed by the call to <b>memset</b>. It's<br>
being kind by preflighting its memory allocations and choosing a heap only if the<br>
allocation would leave at least 32K free afterward. GX is an unknowing partner in<br>
crime: it sets the current heap to the system heap before calling ColorSync so&nbsp;&nbsp;that it<br>
doesn't inadvertently cause relocatable blocks to be purged or relocated across a GX<br>
Graphics call.
</p>
<p>
KON Rebuilding THINK's ANSI library with 4-byte ints enabled will solve the<br>
problem. So how come printing succeeded under System 7.1?
</p>
<p>
Josh When we printed under 7.5, which had every INIT ever written for the Macintosh<br>
installed, and a few MS-DOS TSRs thrown in as well, the system heap was pretty full,<br>
so ColorSync tried to allocate the handle in temp memory, using TempNewHandle and<br>
<b>memset</b>. Crash! Under 7.1, there was lots of system heap space, so ColorSync would<br>
just call NewHandleClear and everything would work fine.
</p>
<p>
KON Nasty.
</p>
<p>
Josh Yeah.
