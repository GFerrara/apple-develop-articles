<p>
<i>OpenDoc, Apple's compound-document architecture, offers a new experience to users.</i><br>
<i>This article gives developers a guided tour of OpenDoc's human interface and describes</i><br>
<i>its conceptual model. We provide the necessary background for helping you fit your</i><br>
<i>application into the OpenDoc world, and present some of the decisions you'll have to</i><br>
<i>make that represent a departure from today's applications.</i>
</p>
<p>
OpenDoc provides a new user paradigm: the user focuses on creating a document or<br>
performing a task, rather than on using a particular application. Understanding the<br>
OpenDoc user experience is a prerequisite to developing OpenDoc part editors that are<br>
consistent with and supportive of the OpenDoc design model. We've talked with<br>
developers at OpenDoc training classes who had written code without realizing what<br>
user features they had implemented; this article will provide a context for the<br>
OpenDoc code you write. The article describes the OpenDoc user experience on the<br>
Macintosh, but most of it also applies to Microsoft Windows and IBM OS/2.
</p>
<p>
Developer releases of OpenDoc are available through a number of different sources.<br>
The documentation provided in these releases, which includes the OpenDoc<br>
Programmer's Guide, OpenDoc Human Interface Guidelines, and the Drag and Drop<br>
Human Interface Guidelines, can give you much more detail on what's covered here (we<br>
concentrate on the basics, so a lot of exceptions aren't covered). Some of the technical<br>
basics of OpenDoc are also covered in the<i>develop </i>articles "Building an OpenDoc Part<br>
Handler" in Issue 19 and "Getting Started With OpenDoc Graphics" in Issue 21.
</p>
<h2>ALL ABOUT PARTS</h2>
<p>
OpenDoc provides an object-oriented user model, where documents are objects that<br>
contain other objects, and where each object may have distinct behaviors. However,<br>
object isn't a term that typical users understand in a document context, so we use part<br>
instead (for "part of the document"). Parts enable all kinds of content to be combined<br>
into a single document. The user sees each part as a self-contained entity with its own<br>
content, behavior, and set of properties. Each part contains one kind of data that's<br>
intrinsic to it, and may contain other parts as well.
</p>
<p>
<b>PARTS AND DOCUMENTS</b>
</p>
<p>
Every document consists of one or more parts: a single part at its top level, called the<br>
root part, and other parts that are embedded in the root part. Documents always reside<br>
on the desktop or in a folder -- that is, they appear in the Finder. (Parts embedded<br>
inside other parts aren't considered to be documents.) Users assemble a document by<br>
embedding parts as needed, with drag and drop or with the Paste and Insert commands,<br>
as we'll see later. Parts can be dragged between documents or onto the desktop (where<br>
they become documents); documents can be dragged from the desktop into other<br>
documents (where they become embedded parts).
</p>
<p>
The root part of a document determines the document's overall characteristics such as<br>
its basic editing metaphor (for instance, text, drawing, or spreadsheet), the size of its<br>
work area (its "page"), its printing options, and whether saving is manual or<br>
automatic.
</p>
<p>
<b>PART CONTENT: INTRINSIC AND EMBEDDED</b>
</p>
<p>
Every part has some kind of intrinsic content, as defined by the part developer. This is<br>
the content that's natural to the part, such as characters and paragraphs in a text part,<br>
or lines, circles, rectangles, and so on in a graphics part. In addition to its intrinsic<br>
content, a part may contain embedded parts that have their own intrinsic content, as<br>
shown in Figure 1.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/179.gif" width="318 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1. </b>A text part with an embedded graphics part
</p>
<p>
There's no requirement that a part be able to contain embedded parts, although it's<br>
usually desirable. Some parts have content models in which embedding doesn't make<br>
sense -- for example, sound parts or parts that display information, such as clocks or<br>
stock tickers. As a developer, you must decide whether it's desirable for parts you<br>
create to allow other parts to be embedded. But, a key characteristic of OpenDoc is that<br>
if a part can contain one kind of part, it can contain all kinds of parts. (Contrast this<br>
with traditional documents, which can contain only certain standard data types, such as<br>
text, PICT, and TIFF, in addition to their intrinsic content.) To a part, any parts<br>
embedded within it are "black boxes" -- parts need know nothing about the internal<br>
structure or semantics of embedded parts.
</p>
<p>
<b>PART BEHAVIOR: EDITORS AND VIEWERS</b>
</p>
<p>
There's little difference between the appearance of the OpenDoc window in Figure 1 and<br>
that of a similar window in a page-layout application of today; manipulation of the<br>
window contents, however, can be very different. When users interact with OpenDoc<br>
parts, the resulting behavior is determined by part editors and part viewers.
</p>
<p>
A part editor is a full-featured OpenDoc software component that allows the creation,<br>
editing, and viewing of parts of a particular kind, just as a conventional application<br>
allows manipulation of documents now. Like applications, part editors are sold or<br>
licensed and are legally protected from unauthorized copying and distribution. You<br>
supply users with the part editor (which the user installs in the Editors folder in the<br>
System Folder) and also a stationery pad (which the user will double-click or drag to<br>
create an OpenDoc document or part).
</p>
<p>
A part viewer is a special, limited type of part editor that can display and print a<br>
particular kind of part but can't be used to create or edit such a part. Often a part<br>
viewer will just be a part editor with its editing and part-creation capabilities<br>
removed. It's important that part viewers be widely available, to allow portability of<br>
OpenDoc compound documents across machines and platforms. We encourage you to<br>
create and freely distribute part viewers without restriction for all the kinds of parts<br>
that you support. Wide availability of a particular part viewer encourages purchase<br>
and use of its equivalent part editor, because users will know that other users will be<br>
able to view parts created with that editor.
</p>
<p>
Note that it may be possible to view a part even when neither its editor nor its viewer<br>
is present; translation may occur that substitutes a different, compatible editor. For<br>
example, suppose a user creates a document with a text editor named SurfWriter and<br>
sends it to someone who doesn't have the SurfWriter editor; the document is translated<br>
to a similar format supported by a text editor that the receiving user does have.
</p>
<p>
Users don't work with icons for part editors and part viewers the way they work with<br>
application icons today: editors and viewers aren't launched by double-clicking. So, as<br>
a distinct break from application icons, the icons for editors and viewers have a unique<br>
shape. This shape provides maximum customizable space for your identifying<br>
elements, with no required badges or identifiers such as hands and pencils (see Figure<br>
2).
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2 . </b>The default part editor and part viewer icons
</p>
<p>
As a step toward becoming fully OpenDoc compliant (that is, becoming part editors<br>
themselves), some applications will be converted to container applications --<br>
applications that allow parts to be embedded in their documents, much as some<br>
documents today allow the embedding of QuickTime movies.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of today's applications have plug-in or extension APIs that may be used<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to add functionality to the application. These will continue to be important to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extending the capabilities of part editors.
</p>
<p>
<b>PROPERTIES OF PARTS</b>
</p>
<p>
All parts have a basic set of properties; these include the part kind, the part category,<br>
the view type (icon or frame, as we'll see in a moment), which editor to use, who last<br>
modified the contents of the part, and when the part was last modified. You may decide<br>
to support additional properties for parts that you develop -- for example, whether to<br>
keep a paragraph of text with the next paragraph. Some part properties, such as the<br>
view type, may be modified by users; other properties may be set only by developers<br>
or by the system.
</p>
<p>
<b>Part kind and part category. </b>Two critical part properties that you need to assign<br>
(in your part editor's 'nmap' resources) are part kind and part category.
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Part kind</i> refers to the data format of a part's intrinsic content; it's<br>
analogous to a file's type. This property often has a name similar to the editor<br>
name. If the user changes a part's kind (with the Part Info command in the Edit<br>
menu), the part's content is translated to the new kind.</li>
<li><i>Part category</i> refers to a set of part kinds that are conceptually similar.<br>
OpenDoc uses categories to determine the set of part editors or viewers that<br>
are applicable to a given part, and to decide whether it's appropriate to<br>
translate data during inter-part editing (for example, when content is copied<br>
from one document into another). If a single part editor supports many kinds<br>
of data, these kinds are usually in the same category.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The list of categories is maintained by CI Labs, a consortium that coordinates<br>
cross-platform OpenDoc development; Styled Text and Video are two examples of part<br>
categories. If SurfWriter is a MacWrite-like text editor, its part kind might be<br>
SurfWriter Text and would be in the Styled Text category. The SurfWriter editor<br>
would most likely allow translation from other part kinds in the same category.
</p>
<p>
<b>View type. </b>Your part editor needs to assign the default view type for its embedded<br>
parts, which determines how each part is initially displayed: as an icon or in a frame.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The icon for a part can be not only the standard 32-by-32- and<br>
16-by-16-pixel sizes, but also a thumbnail icon (64-by-64 pixels). The<br>
thumbnail shows a miniature representation (a "poster page") of the part's<br>
contents to help users identify the part. Figure 3 shows the standard icons for<br>
a graphics part, and the thumbnail icon for a text part consisting of a one-page<br>
memo.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img src="img/181.gif" width="324 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b><u>Figure 3. </u></b><u>Icons for OpenDoc parts</u>
</p>
<ul>
<li>A part can be displayed with its contents in a bounded area called a<br>
frame, which allows editing in place (rather than requiring the part to be<br>
opened into a separate window). Frames are usually, but not necessarily,<br>
rectangular. A part's content may be displayed in more than one frame at a<br>
time and may have multiple representations; for example, a tabular part may<br>
be seen as a chart in one frame and as a text table in another.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the Finder, documents are displayed only as 32-by-32- or 16-by-16-pixel icons<br>
in the initial OpenDoc release; eventually thumbnail icons and frames will also be<br>
supported at the Finder level.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Internally, all parts have frames, </b>even when they're displayed as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;icons, but this implementation detail is hidden from the user and so is ignored<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this discussion; here we use frame to mean only the view that displays the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part's contents.
</p>
<p>
Users can change the view type with the Part Info command in the Edit menu (and<br>
possibly with "accelerator" commands, such as View as Icon, that are provided by the<br>
part editor). In Figure 1 above, frame view is desirable because it allows the user to<br>
see the graphic laid out in the document and to edit it in place. An icon view might be<br>
preferable for, say, a spreadsheet part that gives supporting data on a subject covered<br>
broadly in the text. Any frame may be reduced to an icon at any time, or any icon<br>
opened into a frame, without affecting the view type of any other part; however, the<br>
containing part may reflow content when an embedded part's view type is changed.
</p>
<p>
Except that a part may be edited only when its content is viewed in a frame, icons and<br>
frames are functionally equivalent. Operations such as drag and drop that may be<br>
applied to one may be applied to the other. Whether viewed as icons or in frames,<br>
embedded parts can be opened into separate windows if desired (although they're still<br>
embedded parts and not documents).
</p>
<h2>WORKING WITH PARTS</h2>
<p>
Now that you know some of the basics about parts, let's look at what it's like to work<br>
with them. We'll start with what the desktop might look like after the user opens the<br>
document shown earlier in Figure 1 (see Figure 4). Document icons on the desktop<br>
look the same as today, even though some of them, like the Text Document icon,<br>
represent OpenDoc documents. From the user's point of view, there's no apparent<br>
distinction between an OpenDoc document and a "regular" application document. The<br>
menus are those of the text part editor (because the root part -- a text part -- is<br>
active). The menu names are those you'd expect when editing text, except that the File<br>
menu is named Document, and the Application menu icon (to the far right) is a<br>
document icon rather than an application icon. Finally, notice the Stationery folder;<br>
this contains the stationery pads that the user double-clicks or drags to create<br>
documents or parts.
</p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Now suppose the user wants to edit the content of this document's embedded graphics<br>
part. The first step would be to select the content to be edited, just as in applications<br>
today. To select the triangle, the user simply clicks it. As shown in Figure 5, a number<br>
of things happen: The graphics part editor highlights the selected graphics object by<br>
displaying handles. The graphics part becomes active (a border appears around its<br>
frame, its menus replace those of the text editor, and its tool palette appears). The text<br>
part is now inactive. Note that OpenDoc follows an "inside-out" model in determining<br>
which part to activate: it activates the smallest part that contains the mouse location.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/183.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 5. </b>The same desktop after the user clicks the triangle
</p>
<p>
Just as the content of a part may be selected for editing, an embedded part (which is<br>
content of its containing part) may itself be selected for certain operations. To select<br>
an embedded part, the user drags across it or, if the part is active, clicks its border.<br>
Figure 6 shows what happens when the user clicks the active frame border in Figure<br>
5: The graphics part is selected and its border changes to show handles; the part that<br>
contains it -- the text part -- becomes active again. The menus are replaced by the<br>
text menus and the graphics palette goes away. (The same thing happens to the menus<br>
and palette when the user selects text in the text part, or clicks there to get an<br>
insertion point; in all cases, content that resides in the text part has been selected.)
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/184.gif" width="450 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 6. </b>Selected embedded part
</p>
<p>
In summary, parts viewed in frames can be active, inactive, or selected. This state is<br>
indicated by the appearance (or absence) of a frame border. Parts viewed as icons can<br>
be only inactive or selected.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A part is active when it contains the current selection or the<br>
insertion location (which could be a visible insertion point, as in text, or an<br>
unmarked default location, as when the background in a graphics part is<br>
clicked). The selection may be within the part's intrinsic content or it may be<br>
a part embedded in the active part. When an embedded part becomes active,<br>
OpenDoc displays the active frame border -- a double dotted line -- around<br>
the part.</li>
<li>A part is inactive when the user is working in some other part.<br>
When viewed in a frame, an inactive part has no visible frame border around<br>
it. (Note that when a part is inactive, its part editor can still be running; for<br>
example, if there's a part that searches a database, the user can start the<br>
search and go off to do other work in another part in the same document while<br>
the search continues.)</li>
<li>Finally, a part may be selected. The user selects a part in a frame<br>
view by dragging across it, or by clicking its border if it's the active part. The<br>
containing part is responsible for the visual appearance of a selected part's<br>
frame; typically, the frame shows handles, to allow resizing. To select a part<br>
viewed as an icon, the user simply clicks the icon.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In general, as soon as the user clicks inside a part's frame, that part becomes active.<br>
The editor for the previously active part removes its menus, palettes, and other user<br>
interface elements, and the new active part's editor displays its user interface<br>
elements. The active part receives commands and keyboard events. Only one part at a<br>
time may be active within a document because, as in today's documents, there can be<br>
only one selection at a time.
</p>
<p>
<b>RESIZING FRAMES</b>
</p>
<p>
From a user's point of view, resizing a frame is similar to resizing an on-screen<br>
object today. A difference in OpenDoc is that the same frame may show different<br>
numbers of resize handles on its border when it's in different containers, because the<br>
containing part's editor determines the appearance of a selected-frame border. Your<br>
part editor may display more or fewer resize handles than other editors -- and<br>
perhaps none, if your editor doesn't allow the frame's size to be changed.
</p>
<p>
Your part editor also controls how much space an embedded frame occupies. When a<br>
user attempts to change the size of a frame embedded in your part, the embedded part<br>
negotiates with your part about the new size. Your editor may grant the requested size,<br>
reduce it, or refuse altogether, depending on its current contents and other part<br>
preferences such as snap-to-grid. The containing part also determines whether to<br>
adjust the layout of its own intrinsic content around the frame when a frame's size<br>
changes.
</p>
<p>
Some containing parts may require that embedded frames be rectangular, in which<br>
case their selection handles would resize only to rectangular areas. Others might allow<br>
embedded frames to be nonrectangular; for example, a containing part could provide<br>
selection handles that act independently, as shown in Figure 7.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/185.gif" width="438 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 7. </b>Independent resize handles
</p>
<p>
When a user changes the size of your part's frame, you should not stretch or scale the<br>
contents of the frame, but rather just change the viewing area. (Note how this differs<br>
from the resizing of content, such as a selected graphics object, in which case scaling<br>
may well occur.) Figure 8 shows a table part in its original state and after resizing to<br>
a smaller size; the viewing area has become smaller, but the content hasn't been<br>
scaled.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/186.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 8. </b>A table part before and after resizing
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we recommend against scaling when a frame is resized, for some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parts scaling may make sense.
</p>
<p>
To see the entire table, the user can choose View in Window from the Edit menu. The<br>
table part then opens into a separate window (called a part window) allowing all its<br>
content to be seen, as shown in Figure 9. Although the part is viewed in a window, it's<br>
not a document -- it's still an embedded part. Figures 8 and 9 show views of the same<br>
content, and any changes made in one are reflected in the other views.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/187.gif" width="282 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 9. </b>The table part opened into its own window
</p>
<p>
<b>COPYING AND MOVING CONTENT</b>
</p>
<p>
The user can copy and move any content with the Cut, Copy, Paste, and Paste As<br>
commands as well as a variety of drag and drop operations. All these commands and<br>
operations work with embedded parts as well as intrinsic content, and they work<br>
between parts in the same document as well as between different documents. Also, with<br>
drag and drop or the Insert command (in the Document menu), the source for a copy<br>
operation can be an entire document.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paste As command presents a dialog that allows the user to specify the data format<br>
to convert to when pasting. Holding down the Command key during drag and drop is the<br>
equivalent of Paste As; at the end of the drop, the Paste As dialog is presented.
</p>
<p>
Copied or moved content is inserted at the insertion location or replaces the current<br>
selection, with the exception that the Insert command inserts the contents of the<br>
document after the current selection.
</p>
<p>
The part editor makes "embed vs. merge" decisions in certain circumstances -- that<br>
is, whether to insert the copied or moved content as an embedded part or to merge it<br>
with the destination part's intrinsic content. For example, a copied text part would be<br>
merged into another text part but would be inserted as an embedded part in a graphics<br>
part. Users will most often want the part editor to make these decisions, but they can<br>
always override them with the Paste As command.
</p>
<p>
<b>Links. </b>The Paste As command, or its drag and drop equivalent, also allows links to be<br>
created. Links are special cases of the copy operation: OpenDoc updates the copy when<br>
the original content changes (the user specifies in what situations updating should<br>
occur). Both intrinsic content and embedded parts can be linked, and links can exist<br>
within a single part, between two parts in a single document, or between multiple<br>
parts in different documents. The same content can be linked to multiple destinations,<br>
but each link is technically one-way; every link has a single source and a single<br>
destination. Typically, only edits to the source of the link are allowed. Some part<br>
editors may allow edits to the destination (such as a font change); however, these edits<br>
will not persist after the destination is updated from the source.
</p>
<h2>OPENDOC MENUS</h2>
<p>
OpenDoc provides these basic menus when a document is opened: Apple, Document<br>
(replacing the File menu), Edit, Help, and Application. The other menus vary<br>
depending on which part is currently active. As we saw earlier, when a part is<br>
activated, the associated part editor installs its menus and any tool palettes or<br>
in-window controls. When a part (or the document window itself) is deactivated, the<br>
menus and palettes associated with the active part's editor are removed.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that when content is dragged into a frame, the part editor shouldn't install its<br>
menus unless the mouse button is released within the frame. For example, if the user<br>
selects some text in a text part and drags it into a graphics part, the initial text menus<br>
shouldn't be replaced until the user releases the mouse button within the graphics<br>
part.
</p>
<p>
Figure 10 shows what the basic menus might look like when a part whose editor is<br>
named SurfWriter is active. As you can see, the part editor has included its name in<br>
some of the commands. In the sections that follow, we'll look further at some of the<br>
commands in the Document and Edit menus.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 10. </b>The basic OpenDoc menus
</p>
<p>
<b>DOCUMENT MENU COMMANDS</b>
</p>
<p>
Most of the commands in the Document menu behave similarly to their File menu<br>
counterparts. Generally these commands refer to an entire document (the exception,<br>
Open Selection, is here because it's an open operation like Open Document). These<br>
commands should be augmented only if absolutely necessary, and only by the root<br>
part's editor.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice that the Quit command isn't included, nor should it be added; OpenDoc editors<br>
are unloaded automatically when no longer needed. Also note that we're recommending<br>
support for Save a Copy rather than Save As; Save a Copy keeps the current document<br>
open and active, and the copy remains closed until the user opens it.
</p>
<p>
The Document menu includes these new commands: Open Selection, Open Document,<br>
Insert, and Drafts.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Selection opens a selected part into a part window, allowing<br>
the user to, for example, look at the contents of a part viewed as an icon.<br>
(Double-clicking the icon would also work.) Note that this command applies to<br>
the currently selected part and not to the active part, which is the part<br>
containing the current selection.</li>
<li>Open Document is analogous to Open File: it lets the user choose a<br>
document (through the Standard File dialog) and open it into a window, just as<br>
when the document is opened from the Finder.</li>
<li>With the Insert command, the user can choose a document (again,<br>
through the Standard File dialog) to insert into the active part. It inserts the<br>
contents of the document at the insertion location or after the current<br>
selection. This command may be used with a stationery pad to embed a new<br>
"blank" part.</li>
<li>The Drafts command allows the user to take a "snapshot" of the<br>
current state of the document at any time, creating a draft that can be accessed<br>
(or deleted) later through this command. Drafts are stored efficiently, as<br>
differences from the previous draft, so there's little penalty for using them.<br>
Previous drafts are "preserved" historical versions of the document; they<br>
aren't "live" and must be copied out to be edited.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>EDIT MENU COMMANDS</b>
</p>
<p>
The commands in the Edit menu are used to edit contents of the active part -- for<br>
example, selected text or a selected embedded part -- or to modify properties of a<br>
selected part. Because different part editors may require different editing commands,<br>
the active part editor may add additional commands to this menu.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Undo and Redo work as usual except that they can be invoked successively -- that is,<br>
if the user chooses Undo three times in a row, the last three "undoable" actions are<br>
undone in order.
</p>
<p>
As described earlier, Cut, Copy, and Paste can be used to copy and move embedded parts<br>
as well as intrinsic content. The Paste As command lets the user specify the data<br>
format to convert to when pasting, and also includes an option for creating links.
</p>
<p>
The other commands of special interest in the Edit menu are Part Info, View in<br>
Window, and Show Frame Outline:

<ul>
<li>Part Info displays a dialog for editing a selected part's properties<br>
-- for example, changing the part kind to another (compatible) part kind or<br>
changing the view type from icon to frame or vice versa. This command is<br>
replaced by Link Info if the user selects a linked part. If intrinsic content is<br>
selected, the part editor may change this command -- for example, to<br>
Paragraph Info or Circle Info.</li>
<li>View in Window opens the active part into a part window. If the<br>
active part is already viewed in a window, this command brings that window to<br>
the front. (Remember that a selected part can be opened into a part window<br>
with the Open Selection command in the Document menu, or by<br>
double-clicking if it's an icon.)</li>
<li>We recommend that you add Show Frame Outline to the Edit menu<br>
when a part in a frame view is opened into a part window. In the part window,<br>
this command puts an outline around the content that matches what's visible in<br>
the frame in the containing part, making it easier to correlate the two. The<br>
user can also drag the outline to change what's displayed in the frame in the<br>
containing part.</li>
</ul>
<h2>OPENING A WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES</h2>
<p>
OpenDoc revolutionizes the way developers deliver software, and does so without any<br>
dramatic upheavals to the user. OpenDoc part editors and container applications can<br>
coexist with applications and documents of today, providing OpenDoc's benefits without<br>
disrupting how users work with current applications. Your OpenDoc parts should<br>
behave much like current applications, so that users don't have to go through a<br>
substantial learning process. Our user tests show that users think OpenDoc simply<br>
fixes some "bugs" and lets them work the way they want. In other words, you and<br>
OpenDoc will provide business as usual -- plus.

<b>DAVE CURBOW </b>is the technical lead of the OpenDoc Human Interface team. Before<br>
that he worked on AppleScript and developer tools such as ResEdit. In an earlier life he<br>
was a software engineer on the Xerox Star and a now-forgotten mainframe operating<br>
system. When he escapes from the office, Dave can often be found working with his<br>
wife on their house or exploring cathedrals, castles, and other wonders in England<br>
(including the Kew Bridge Steam Museum). It's well known that Dave can be bribed<br>
with dark chocolate.

Interface team. She comes to Apple from research and product development in<br>
collaborative technology and interactive multimedia at US WEST Technologies, Pacific<br>
Bell, and the University of Amsterdam. In her copious free time, she teaches<br>
human-computer interaction at the University of San Francisco, conspires to<br>
resurrect her 1980's tech-punk band, and marvels with her husband at the havoc<br>
potential of their two-year-old daughter.
