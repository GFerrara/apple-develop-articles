<h1>The Veteran Neophyte: A Feel for the Thing</h1>

<p>
I used to think there was no room for mystery in the world of computers. I didn't think<br>
there was any use for fudge factors or rules of thumb or hunches in the clean, exact,<br>
hermetically sealed bubble of logic we all spend so much time diddling and poking. That<br>
stuff belongs to "real world" engineering, not software engineering, right? Software is<br>
always bounded and orderly, always understood completely from top to bottom, with no<br>
dangling ends, no frayed edges, and no baling wire and duct tape holding things together.<br>
There's never a need for vague, hand-waving explanations of how it all works, because<br>
we know how it works.
</p>
<p>
That's what I used to think. I'm not so sure anymore.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, of course, the operation of computers is deterministic and absolutely<br>
predictable. There's guaranteed to be a complete explanation for any event on the<br>
computer; the search for an answer will always find one. It's like playing Go Fish with<br>
a deck of cards that contains only threes -- "Got any threes?" "Yep." "Got any threes?"<br>
"Yep." "Got any threes?" "Yep." The answer itself, of course, may be convoluted and<br>
difficult, and is often <i>way</i> too much trouble to actually track down ("Have you tried<br>
rebooting?"), but it's always there. The world inside computers has a definite,<br>
impermeable bottom, like a swimming pool.
</p>
<p>
The real world, on the other hand, is more like being out in the middle of the ocean: the<br>
bottom is nowhere in sight, and in fact is so far away that it may as well not exist at<br>
all. Trying to completely explain things in the real world is generally an exercise in<br>
futility, though one that humans seem to have a capacious appetite for (that's what<br>
science is all about, after all). The real world is so vast and complex that our<br>
explanations are never really complete. The answers always lead to more questions,<br>
and the edges of our knowledge remain frayed and ragged and crumbling, even though<br>
the center may have a seemingly solid, well supported integrity.
</p>
<p>
The thing that got me thinking about all this is boomerangs. I've been learning to throw<br>
boomerangs lately, and it's extremely satisfying -- and somehow endlessly novel -- to<br>
throw something away from yourself as hard as you can, and have it return several<br>
seconds later, hovering gently down into your waiting hands like a bird coming home to<br>
roost. (Such a perfect flight, of course, is a rare thing for a novice like me. More<br>
often, if the boomerang comes anywhere near me, it's slicing past at a frightening rate<br>
of speed while I cringe, covering my head.) While I've been learning to throw<br>
boomerangs, I've also been trying to watch myself learn to throw boomerangs -- sort<br>
of meta-boomeranging -- and I noticed that a complete explanation of what was<br>
happening was not only absent, but completely unnecessary: I don't need to know how<br>
boomerangs work to learn to throw them well.
</p>
<p>
Boomerang throwing is one of those real-world activities -- there are many of them<br>
-- that are governed by rules of thumb, by approximation and estimation, and by<br>
"feel." There are lots of variables involved in producing a good boomerang flight, and<br>
they're all sort of woven together, interconnected and interdependent. The direction of<br>
the throw, the angle of the boomerang as it leaves your hand, the forward power of the<br>
throw, and the amount of spin all contribute to the flight characteristics, but the way<br>
they combine and interact is complex and nonobvious. How's a poor, bewildered<br>
boomerang neophyte to make any sense of it all?
</p>
<p>
Well, the only way to learn to throw boomerangs is to get yourself a decent boomerang<br>
(very important!), read a little about it or get a lesson from someone, and then just<br>
get out there and start throwing. You need to experience it; you need to feel the smooth,<br>
flat weight of the thing, notice the way it slices the wind as it leaves your hand, and<br>
watch as it spins and swoops. Every throw you make adds to a growing store of<br>
knowledge about boomerang behavior. Slowly, you begin to sense the structure of the<br>
rules that govern the flight of the boomerang, to get a feel for it, to gain some control.<br>
But no matter how long you work at it, there's always more you can learn about<br>
boomerangs. Boomerang throwing, like most things in the real world, has no bottom.
</p>
<p>
But even though things in the real world are webby, tangled, and complex, with no real<br>
bottom and no real center, and even though complete understanding is out of our reach,<br>
that doesn't stop us from getting things done. Even though we may not understand<br>
exactly what's going on when we throw a boomerang, we can learn to throw them<br>
anyway, and can actually learn to throw them with incredible skill. Scientists don't<br>
have a complete understanding of fluid mechanics, but we can still design hydraulic<br>
lifts that lift, toilets that flush, and airplanes that fly.
</p>
<p>
Though it seemed profound when I first thought of it that way, it really isn't anything<br>
remarkable at all. It's the stuff our everyday sensory world is made of. It's our<br>
standard, animal mode of operation. We depend heavily on trial and error, on finding<br>
and keeping strategies that work. We invent myths and superstitions to explain things<br>
we don't understand, we guess, we fake it, we operate by feel. And it works just fine.
</p>
<p>
But we don't need that sort of thing in the clean, deterministic world of computers,<br>
right? If we know the answer is within our reach, then why gloss over it? There's one<br>
very good reason: it's gotten to the point where it's often really hard to reach the<br>
answer. Computers have become so complex that finding the real answer is often a<br>
Herculean feat requiring great effort and stamina. The things that we're "growing" in<br>
the machine are getting very deep and webby and complex, just like things in the real<br>
world. That nice smooth bottom we all know and love is getting pretty remote and hard<br>
to see, and in fact trying to keep it in sight often holds us back.
</p>
<p>
The truth is, we need fakery, or myth, or something similar, to avoid being hopelessly<br>
mired in complexity, and to let us feel cozy even in the face of something too deep to<br>
comfortably understand. The idea that an icon in the Finder, a document window in an<br>
application, and a file on the hard disk are all "the same thing" is a fiction, an illusion<br>
created from smoke and mirrors, and one that users don't even think about anymore<br>
(unless, of course, an application screws up the illusion; see Mark Linton's article in<br>
this issue for some code to help you avoid such a faux pas). But it's precisely that kind<br>
of myth and abstraction that lets people ignore all the underlying complexity and just<br>
go about their everyday business. Without that kind of trickery most people would be<br>
lost.
</p>
<p>
Humans have a deep need for some sort of explanation, and we'll often ignore aspects of<br>
a situation, or even make stuff up out of thin air, if it helps us to find an "answer."<br>
Remember the frictionless inclined planes and perfect vacuums of college physics?<br>
Without that kind of glossing over of details, we'd have been helpless. (A college<br>
housemate of mine and I used to joke about running a college physics stockroom: boxes<br>
of frictionless, massless pulleys on the shelves; gallon jugs of zero-viscosity liquid at<br>
our feet; coils of infinite and semi-infinite wires hanging neatly on the pegboard wall.<br>
Those wires have no thickness or mass, thank goodness, or the storage requirements<br>
would be prohibitive.) This need for explanation is what has led us to science, and to<br>
religion, and to superstition. These are not the same thing, of course, but they can all<br>
serve the same purpose: a soothing, protective balm on the raw edges of our incomplete<br>
knowledge. They give us a ground to stand on, a rail to hold on to, as we totter along in<br>
the darkness, going who knows where, hoping the batteries will hold out long enough to<br>
get an answer.
</p>
<p>
Now that I think about it, I'm happiest with a generous helping of myth and fiction<br>
stirred into my computing. It can help make the computer -- which, let's face it, is<br>
essentially a gritty, sharp-edged, and hostile machine -- feel more rounded and<br>
friendly. It can provide a useful disguise, like a plastic nose and glasses on something<br>
seething and alien, making it recognizable, familiar, even comforting and amusing. If<br>
it's done well, it can even let me learn to use a computer in much the same way I learn<br>
to throw a boomerang: by picking it up and trying it, by mucking around and getting a<br>
feel for it, by discovery.
</p>
<p>
Maybe best of all, it lets computers keep a little of their mystery. The mystery and<br>
magic of the Macintosh are why many of us are programmers, after all. Mysterious<br>
things, things that don't have clean and obvious boundaries, are inevitably more<br>
interesting and more fun. There's no denying that computers have a dull, featureless,<br>
dreary bottom. But in the other direction there seems to be no boundary; the top, if<br>
there is one, is as far away as the sky. So yes, I think there's plenty of room for<br>
mystery in the world of computing. Plenty of room indeed.
