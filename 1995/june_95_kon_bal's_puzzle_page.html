</p>
<p>
Chris I have a piece of code that runs fine on my Quadra, but when I run it on a plain<br>
old 68000 it crashes.
</p>
<p>
KON A 68000? So you're still trying to get GX to run on that Mac Portable in Cary's<br>
office, huh? How does it crash?
</p>
<p>
Chris With an address error.
</p>
<p>
KON What's hard about that? Your code is doing a 2- or 4-byte access to an odd<br>
address, which is OK on a 68040 but not on a 68000. It's a trivial problem.
</p>
<p>
Chris That's what I thought, but the address it's accessing appears to be uninitialized<br>
data. The code is simply allocating a block and then storing a pointer in the block, but<br>
the store never seems to occur, because afterward the block has random data in it. And<br>
of course the block itself is long-aligned, because it came from the Memory Manager,<br>
so there's no problem there.
</p>
<p>
KON Maybe on your Quadra, but on a Mac Plus the Memory Manager allocates blocks<br>
that are word-aligned.
</p>
<p>
Chris Thanks for the history lesson, chief, but this isn't a Mac Plus and the Memory<br>
Manager on this machine is much different -- much simpler, actually. It just so<br>
happens that our Memory Manager always long-aligns blocks.
</p>
<p>
KON Since when are you writing new Memory Managers? I thought you wrote graphics<br>
code.
</p>
<p>
Chris Yes. But the cornerstone of any decent graphics system is its Memory Manager<br>
-- I wouldn't expect a "QuickDraw classic" guy like you to understand.
</p>
<p>
KON I understand memory management just fine, Jackson. Show me where you're<br>
setting up this data.
</p>
<p>
<b>100</b> Chris This is the interesting section:
</p>
<pre>NewDMAQueueEntry
...
+0030 0020C5D6  MOVE.L  D3,D0
+0036 0020C5DC  _NewPtr
+0038 0020C5DE  MOVE.L  A0,-$0008(A6)
+003C 0020C5E2  MOVE.L  -$000C(A6),-(A7)
+0040 0020C5E6  MOVEA.W -$000E(A6),A1
+0044 0020C5EA  MOVE.L  A1,-(A7)
+0046 0020C5EC  JSR     *+$53A4 ; 00211990
+004A 0020C5F0  MOVE.L  D0,-$000C(A6)
+004E 0020C5F4  MOVE.L  A2,(A0,D0.L)</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;It makes the _NewPtr call, makes some other function call, and then stores the<br>
pointer in A2 into our newly allocated buffer.
</p>
<p>
KON What's the other function call doing?
</p>
<p>
<b>95</b> Chris I'm not sure, actually. The C source doesn't indicate that a function call<br>
should be happening:
</p>
<pre>buffer = NewPtr(totalSize);
count = count * size;
*(long *) (buffer + count) = (long) handlerProc;</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;The only thing I see happening in the source code is a multiply. You don't need a<br>
function call for that.
</p>
<p>
KON Could this be some wacky C++ operator overloading nonsense? C++ is very good<br>
at generating extra function calls. I think we'd better bring a SmartFriend in on this<br>
one.
</p>
<p>
Chris Don't bring out the big guns just yet. The code is written completely in plain old<br>
C: no C++ and no CFront.
</p>
<p>
KON It's got to be code you've written, because it's a PC-relative JSR. Since it's not an<br>
A5- relative JSR, it's not going through the jump table, so it couldn't have been linked<br>
in from a library or something external to your program. It looks like a call to a static<br>
function.
</p>
<p>
Chris Actually, all the JSR instructions in this code are PC-relative. I wrote&nbsp;&nbsp;a tool<br>
that transforms all JSRs that go through the jump table to PC-relative JSRs. You may<br>
want to sit down for this next part -- it's a little tricky.
</p>
<p>
KON That's why it ended up in the Puzzle Page. Let's hear it.
</p>
<p>
<b>90</b> Chris All the code is being built into a ROM; however, our development system of<br>
choice only allows us to build our code as a Mac application. So I created a custom tool<br>
that postprocesses the application and turns it into something that will run out of ROM.<br>
Basically we use the CODE 0 jump table to link everything together.
</p>
<p>
KON I see. You know where the code will reside in ROM, so you fake out the jump table<br>
to make it look as if all the segments are loaded. Since nothing will ever move or<br>
unload, your ROM jump table entries never need to change. Pretty tricky.
</p>
<p>
Chris But not tricky enough. The scheme you describe will work, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;has two<br>
problems. First, our ROM can be mapped into different addresses, so the code must be<br>
completely relocatable. A Mac jump table contains JMP instructions with fixed long<br>
addresses (for example, JMP $4083143A), which are not relocatable. Second, as a<br>
cycle counter like you should know, the jump table is superfluous here, because no<br>
code will ever move or unload while it's running. You're doing a JSR to the JMP in the<br>
jump table -- the extra JMP is unnecessary and wastes cycles.
</p>
<p>
KON I didn't know you GX guys counted cycles. How do you get away with removing the<br>
extra JMP?
</p>
<p>
<b>85</b> Chris Our tool scans all the object code for all instructions that reference the<br>
jump table. They are JSR xx(A5) (function call), PEA xx(A5) (pass a function<br>
pointer on the stack), and LEA xx(A5),Ax (get a function pointer in a local variable).<br>
When it finds one of these instructions, it looks up the function in the jump table and<br>
changes the instruction to a PC-relative version that simply references the address of<br>
the target function directly. Everything is PC-relative, so it relocates correctly, and<br>
there are no extra instructions.
</p>
<p>
KON But the PC-relative addressing mode has only a 16-bit offset, so you can only<br>
reference functions within 32K of the PC. Is your ROM that small?
</p>
<p>
<b>80</b> Chris Are you kidding? The pictures for the About box are bigger than that. When<br>
we need to reference a function that's beyond 32K, we create a "jump island" that's<br>
still PC- relative but allows us a greater reach.
</p>
<pre>0020122A:   JSR     $00201FA8       ;go to jump island
0020122E:   MOVE.W  D0,(A3)
...
00201FA8:   LEA     *+0,A0          ;get pc
00201FAC:   ADDA.L  #$00014B02,A0   ;add long offset
00201FB2:   JMP (A0)                ;jump to destination</pre>
<p>
KON That looks suspicious to me. You're messing with A0 in your jump island.
</p>
<p>
<b>75</b> Chris But that should be OK because the whole thing is written in C, which never<br>
passes a parameter in A0 and never expects A0 to be preserved.
</p>
<p>
KON I can't find a specific problem, but I'm still a little suspicious of all&nbsp;&nbsp;this OS code<br>
you're writing. You said that this code runs fine on&nbsp;&nbsp;your Quadra. Does the Quadra<br>
version undergo the jump table transformation process?
</p>
<p>
Chris No. The Quadra version is run just like a Mac application out of RAM.
</p>
<p>
KON Tell me all the differences between the two environments.
</p>
<p>
<b>70</b> Chris The 68000 version of the software is different in two ways. First, it's<br>
generated with the exact same compiler, but without 68020 code generation enabled.<br>
Then, I run it through my BuildROM tool, which transforms all the jump table<br>
references to PC- relative references. The 68000 target hardware is a diskless<br>
system; the only way to get code into it is through ROM cartridges, so we can't try to<br>
run a version of the software that hasn't undergone the BuildROM step.
</p>
<p>
KON So the bug may have nothing to do with the differences between the 68040 and<br>
68000 processors -- it may be the BuildROM process. Let's sum up what we know:<br>
First we saw a piece of code that allocates a block of memory and stores a value into<br>
that block, but the store never seems to happen. Near that code is an unexplained JSR<br>
which we believe is a function call. Finally, we know that a critical difference in the<br>
environment is that you alter the code path of function calls. It's really starting to<br>
smell like your BuildROM tool.
</p>
<p>
Chris The evidence is all circumstantial, counselor. The only questionable part of the<br>
BuildROM process we've seen is my usage of A0 in the jump islands, but I can't see a<br>
case where a C function call takes a parameter in A0 or assumes A0 is preserved.
</p>
<p>
KON We should trace through the NewDMAQueueEntry routine and see what that<br>
mysterious function call is doing.
</p>
<p>
<b>65</b> Chris I put in a breakpoint. But when I run the program again, I drop into the<br>
debugger with a debug message complaining that some kind of parameter is out of<br>
range.
</p>
<p>
KON You mean the bug isn't reproducible?
</p>
<p>
Chris After many tries, this is the first time it's failed this way.
</p>
<p>
KON Hmm. What parameter is out of range?
</p>
<p>
Chris The debug message doesn't say, exactly. The value it's complaining about is in<br>
D2. The value is $00004E56.
</p>
<p>
KON That's a funny-looking number. It looks like an opcode to me. <b> dh 4E56</b> tells me<br>
it's a LINK A6,#xx instruction. Where did the value in D2 come from?
</p>
<p>
<b>60</b> Chris From a MOVE.W (A0),D2 instruction. The code seems to think A0 points to<br>
some data.
</p>
<p>
KON But it looks as if it points to code instead. Where is A0?
</p>
<p>
Chris It points to the start of a routine called VBLHandler.
</p>
<p>
KON VBLHandler sure sounds like an interrupt service routine to me, which would<br>
explain the various failure modes. Is the routine written in C? C routines don't bother<br>
to preserve A0, so your interrupt routine is trashing a register!
</p>
<p>
<b>55</b> Chris There's some inline assembly code to save all the registers. Take a look:
</p>
<pre> void VBLHandler(void)
{
asm {
    MOVEM.L     A0-A6/D0-D7, -(SP)
};

FlushQueue();
HandleVBLTasks();

asm {
    MOVEM.L     (SP)+, A0-A6/D0-D7
};
}</pre>
<p>
KON It seems quite suspicious to me that A0 points to the beginning of this routine.<br>
Sounds like your jump islands are at work. Look at the interrupt vector for your VBL<br>
handler.
</p>
<p>
<b>50</b> Chris On this particular machine the VBL is handled as a level-6 interrupt. The<br>
level-6 vector is at $0078. It points to a jump island entry like the one above.
</p>
<p>
KON And the first thing it does is trash A0 before your inline assembly gets a chance to<br>
save it! Maybe you should stick to drawing bitmaps and leave the OS work to someone<br>
else.
</p>
<p>
<b>45</b> Chris The problem is that the code that installed the interrupt handler is more<br>
than 32K away from the handler itself. So when it did an LEA xx(A5),Ax to get the<br>
address of the interrupt handler, the ROM builder tool needed to stick a jump island in<br>
there. Nasty. But I still need a way to do PC-relative jump islands.
</p>
<p>
KON Use the stack, son. Try this:
</p>
<pre>PEA     * ;push the pc
ADD.L   #xxxxxx,(sp) ;add a long offset
RTS     ;jump to the destination</pre>
<p>
Chris All this and you can draw bitmaps too! I'll fix the ROM builder tool to do this. But<br>
somehow I doubt that a VBL interrupt was hitting us at the same spot in my<br>
NewDMAQueueEntry routine every time. There must be another problem there.
</p>
<p>
KON We still have the breakpoint there; before we recompile and fix the bug, let's run<br>
it again and see if we can get the original failure mode to happen again.
</p>
<p>
<b>40</b> Chris This time we hit the breakpoint. We trace over the NewPtr and see that it<br>
returns a valid pointer in A0. We step into the JSR at $20C5EC and it takes us to one<br>
of my jump islands.
</p>
<p>
KON Which alters A0, and then jumps to the function being called. What is the function<br>
doing?
</p>
<p>
<b>35</b> Chris It's a very short routine; it just takes some parameters off the stack and<br>
does a few multiplies. It returns the result in D0 just like any normal C function<br>
would.
</p>
<p>
KON But is it using the trashed A0 for anything?
</p>
<p>
Chris No. In fact, it's not using any address registers at all. It only uses data registers<br>
for the multiplies. I repeat: no C function would ever take a parameter in A0.
</p>
<p>
KON So we return to the NewDMAQueueEntry routine, with a return value in D0. We<br>
save D0 in a local variable on the stack frame, and then hit the instruction at<br>
$20C5F4, which stores a value in the buffer pointed to by A0.
</p>
<p>
<b>30</b> Chris But A0 still has the result of the jump island calculation in it. The code<br>
didn't set up A0 to point to anything!
</p>
<p>
KON Look at the listing of NewDMAQueueEntry again. The code gets the result of the<br>
NewPtr call in A0, makes the function call, and then assumes that A0 still has the valid<br>
pointer in it. But meanwhile, some wannabe OS programmer has gotten in there and<br>
hosed A0 on us!
</p>
<p>
<b>20</b> Chris That function call seems to be doing the multiply. It must be some runtime<br>
math library that the compiler uses.
</p>
<p>
KON I'll bet one of your variables is a long word. With 68020 code generation turned<br>
on, the compiler was able to generate a long multiply instruction, but the 68000<br>
doesn't have a long multiply instruction, so it calls the math library.
</p>
<p>
<b>10</b> Chris I see. Since the math library was written by the same people who wrote the<br>
compiler, their code generator knows that A0 won't get trashed, so it doesn't bother to<br>
save and restore it around the call to the long multiply routine. Pretty sneaky.
</p>
<p>
KON But nice. You want the person writing your code generator to be the&nbsp;&nbsp;ultimate<br>
cycle counter. Since the Mac Segment Loader implementation&nbsp;&nbsp;doesn't trash A0, it's a<br>
worthwhile optimization for them to make.
</p>
<p>
Chris Except in this case, the code that performs a multiply is more than 32K away<br>
from where the math library resides in the ROM, so it hits a jump island and loses the<br>
value of A0.
</p>
<p>
KON Even a lowly register like A0 is sacred sometimes.
</p>
<p>
Chris So it appears.
</p>
<p>
KON Nasty.
</p>
<p>
Chris Yeah.
