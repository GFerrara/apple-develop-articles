<h1>Graphical Truffles: Making the Most of QuickDraw<br>
3D</h1>
<h2>Nick Thompson and Pablo Fernicola</h2>

</p>
<p>
For those of us on Apple's QuickDraw 3D team, the highlight of SIGGRAPH '95 (the<br>
annual conference of the ACM's computer graphics interest group) was having the<br>
chance to work with developers who were showing QuickDraw 3D products.<br>
Considering that we only started working with developers in December 1994, the<br>
number of applications already up and running is inspiring. By the time you read this<br>
column, 10 or 15 QuickDraw 3D products will be shipping, including modeling and<br>
animation software, 3D hardware accelerators, 3D model clip art, and games. More<br>
than 50 developers are actively working on products based on QuickDraw 3D, and<br>
those will ship in 1996.
</p>
<p>
If you're not yet a QuickDraw 3D developer and don't want to be left out, take a look at<br>
the <i>develop</i> articles "QuickDraw 3D: A New Dimension for Macintosh Graphics" in<br>
Issue 22 and "The Basics of QuickDraw 3D Geometries" in Issue 23. This column gives<br>
a hodgepodge of additional information.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPROVING ACCELERATOR PERFORMANCE</b>
</p>
<p>
One of the things that has attracted developers to QuickDraw 3D is seamless access to<br>
hardware acceleration. In addition to Apple's PCI accelerator card, hardware<br>
acceleration cards have been announced by Matrox, Yarc, Radius, and Newer<br>
Technology. If you really want your application to fly, you need to make sure that<br>
you're using the fastest renderer possible and that if a hardware acceleration card is<br>
installed, you're using the card. If you use the QuickDraw 3D API, QuickDraw 3D will<br>
take care of this for you, but there's something else you can do that might improve<br>
your application's performance.
</p>
<p>
Certain cards, including Apple's accelerator card, will yield better frame rates in<br>
some situations if you use what we call <i>double buffer bypass</i>, an option enabled by a<br>
flag. Double buffering causes all objects to be drawn first into a back buffer; this<br>
entire buffer is then copied to the front buffer (the window). If the scene you're<br>
rendering is simple and thus takes very little time to redraw --&nbsp;&nbsp;say, less than 1/10<br>
of a second -- enabling double buffer bypass is faster because it avoids having to copy<br>
memory from the back buffer to the front buffer. On the other hand, if you use this<br>
option with a complex scene, tearing may occur. Therefore, you may want to time a<br>
frame (and take into account the complexity of your models) before using double<br>
buffer bypass. To time a frame, call the Toolbox routine Microseconds, draw the<br>
frame, call Q3Renderer_Sync to make sure the frame has been fully drawn, and then<br>
call Microseconds again and subtract the start time from the end time.
</p>
<p>
If you're using QuickDraw 3D's interactive software renderer, all the code you need to<br>
turn on double buffer bypass is shown in Listing 1.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1.</b> Turning on double buffer bypass
</p>
<pre>// Create the renderer.
if ((myRenderer = Q3Renderer_NewFromType(kQ3RendererTypeInteractive))
       != nil) {
   if ((myStatus = Q3View_SetRenderer(myView, myRenderer))
          == kQ3Failure) {  // Handle the error.
      ...
   }   // Set bypass.
   Q3InteractiveRenderer_SetDoubleBufferBypass(myRenderer, kQ3True);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The interactive renderer can render using software only or using hardware<br>
acceleration. The interactive renderer is set by default to look for the best device<br>
possible, so if a hardware accelerator is installed, the accelerator will always be used.<br>
On occasion, though, you may want to switch from using hardware to using software<br>
(for demos or testing, for example). In this case you must explicitly request the<br>
software rasterizer, as follows:
</p>
<pre>Q3InteractiveRenderer_SetPreferences(myRenderer,
   kQAVendor_Apple, kQAEngine_AppleSW);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>INTERACTING WITH INPUT DEVICES</b>
</p>
<p>
QuickDraw 3D provides an input device abstraction layer that allows you to interact<br>
with different input devices without having to write special code for each of them. The<br>
sample application NewEra demonstrates interaction with tablets and other input<br>
devices; this application is available on the CD that comes with the book <i>3D Graphics</i><br>
<i>Programming With QuickDraw 3D</i>, and a newer version can be found on this issue's<br>
CD.
</p>
<p>
To take advantage of QuickDraw 3D's input device layer, you need to create a tracker<br>
object and associate it with a controller object (created by an input device driver), as<br>
Listing 2 does. Once you've set up your tracker, you can poll it to get its new position<br>
and orientation, as shown in Listing 3. To reflect the change in your scene, you apply<br>
the values returned by the tracker to a transform object, affecting either a particular<br>
geometry or group (if an object was selected and being manipulated) or the camera,<br>
depending on the interaction model for your application.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 2. </b>Creating a tracker object and attaching it to a controller object
</p>
<pre>theDocument-&gt;fPositionSN = 0;
theDocument-&gt;fRotationSN = 0;
theDocument-&gt;fTracker = Q3Tracker_New(NULL);
myStatus = Q3Controller_Next(NULL, &amp;controllerRef);
while (controllerRef != NULL &amp;&amp; myStatus == kQ3Success) {
   Q3Controller_SetTracker(controllerRef, theDocument-&gt;fTracker);
   myStatus = Q3Controller_Next(controllerRef, &amp;controllerRef);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 3. </b>Updating position and orientation
</p>
<pre>// We received a null event; grab a new position and orientation
// for the model.
TQ3Boolean      positionChanged;
TQ3Boolean      rotationChanged;

Q3Tracker_GetPosition(doc.fTracker, &amp;doc.fPosition, NULL,
    &amp;positionChanged, &amp;doc.fPositionSN);
Q3Tracker_GetOrientation(doc.fTracker, &amp;doc.fRotation, NULL,
    &amp;rotationChanged, &amp;doc.fRotationSN);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
QuickDraw 3D's input device abstraction layer also makes writing input device<br>
drivers easier. For example, it took us about three days to write a driver for the<br>
Magellan device from Logitech, Inc., a 3D input device with six degrees of freedom. As<br>
illustrated in Figure 1, this device enables movement along the x, y, and z axes, as<br>
well as rotation about the three axes.

<p>
<b>SETTING THE CORRECT FILE TYPE</b>
</p>
<p>
When saving QuickDraw 3D metafiles, you should set the file type as '3DMF',<br>
regardless of how the contents of the file are formatted (as plain-text or binary, or<br>
any combination of the different types of organization, such as database or stream).<br>
This will enable the file to be read or opened by other QuickDraw 3D applications. If<br>
you'd like your end users to read a file as text, add an Export As Text option to your<br>
application and then set the file type to 'TEXT'. This is helpful for debugging (and for<br>
sending questions or bugs to Developer Technical Support).
</p>
<p>
<b>HAVING FUN WITH CUSTOM ATTRIBUTES</b>
</p>
<p>
By taking advantage of QuickDraw 3D's custom attributes and extensible metafile<br>
format, you can have objects that encapsulate specialized data relevant to your<br>
application. For instance, to navigate through the World Wide Web in 3D, you can<br>
attach Web data (like URLs) to QuickDraw 3D objects as custom attributes. When<br>
those objects or scenes are read into one of the many viewers supporting the URL<br>
custom attribute, the viewer can communicate through Apple events with applications<br>
like Netscape (or your favorite Web browser) to produce 3D navigation. You'll find a<br>
sample application that shows how to do this on this issue's CD.
</p>
<p>
Custom attributes also enable you to associate sound and other data with objects in<br>
your 3D scene.
</p>
<p>
<b>DEBUGGING</b>
</p>
<p>
There are two really handy techniques that you can use to diagnose problems you may<br>
be having with your QuickDraw 3D application. For both of these approaches to<br>
debugging your software, you'll want to make sure that you have MacsBug installed on<br>
your machine and that you're using the debugging version of the QuickDraw 3D<br>
extension supplied with the QuickDraw 3D development software.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The first technique is to install error and warning handlers, described in our article<br>
in develop Issue 22. Error and warning handlers are particularly useful for telling<br>
you of potential problems with your use of the QuickDraw 3D library. If you don't<br>
install error and warning handlers, you won't know if you're doing something that the<br>
library identifies as erroneous. Although we stated this in our original article, many<br>
developers missed its significance and thus have experienced longer debugging times<br>
than necessary and a great deal of frustration.
</p>
<p>
The second technique is to use a software tool, the 3D debugger, included on this issue's<br>
CD. This application enables you to examine the QuickDraw 3D heap and look at the<br>
different objects, their attributes, and their reference count. Please note that you're<br>
looking under the hood, so you may encounter untyped blocks, and the reference count<br>
for objects may reflect references internal to the QuickDraw 3D system.
</p>
<p>
<b>LOOKING AHEAD</b>
</p>
<p>
We'll continue to release great new QuickDraw 3D features, so bring your applications<br>
along for the ride. By early 1996 we expect to have all major existing 3D applications<br>
on the Macintosh using QuickDraw 3D, along with applications that developers port<br>
from other platforms. Many 2D applications will be making use of the 3D Viewer as<br>
well.

<b>NICK THOMPSON </b>(eWorld NICKT), transplanted English soccer fan and member of<br>
Apple's Developer Technical Support team, thinks that this could be the year for the<br>
Arsenal Football Club. With the acquisition of Dutch star Dennis Bergkamp and England<br>
striker David Platt, things are looking up at Highbury. By the time you read this, the<br>
Premier League standings will tell if this is the dawning of a new era or more of the<br>
same "boring, boring, Arsenal," as those charming Spurs fans like to chant.
</p>
<p>
<b>PABLO FERNICOLA</b> (eWorld EscherDude), of Apple's Interactive Multimedia Group,<br>
is much more relaxed since shipping QuickDraw 3D 1.0. He now has time to eat his<br>
dad's great barbecue, dally with his lovely wife, and sleep -- although the latter<br>
entails the challenge of trying to get his golden retriever, aptly named Mac, to give up<br>
some of the space he takes up in the bed. Pablo's latest research project is to find out<br>
exactly what the purpose is for those orange balls that one finds on high power<br>
transmission lines.
