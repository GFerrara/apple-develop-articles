<h1>Balance Of Power:&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced Performance Profiling</h1>

<p>
There's little that compares to diving headfirst toward the ground at 120 miles per<br>
hour. I may have been going even faster when I last went skydiving. Tucking my arms<br>
in tightly, with my head back and legs even, I heard a deafening roar from the wind as I<br>
sped toward terminal velocity. "Terminal" would have been a good word for the<br>
situation if it weren't for the advances that have been made in parachute technology.
</p>
<p>
Parachutes have come a long way since their debut, when they were billowy round<br>
disks of silk sewn with simple cords stretching to a harness. They were greatly<br>
improved when the square parachute was invented thirty years ago. The square<br>
parachutes look like an airplane's wing, and they create lift in much the same way.<br>
Until recently, however, square parachutes weren't improved upon much. Perhaps<br>
their superiority over round parachutes left everyone satiated. That lack of progress<br>
was unfortunate; if recent improvements -- like many-celled parachutes and<br>
automatic activation devices -- had been pursued many years ago, skydiving would be<br>
even safer today.
</p>
<p>
The moral from this is to question satisfaction, and that will be our mantra for this<br>
column. In particular, I want you to question the performance gains you've seen by<br>
moving to native PowerPC code. In this column we'll look at improved tools for<br>
examining PowerPC code performance, and you'll see how such questioning can really<br>
enlighten you.
</p>
<h2>ILLUSIONS</h2>
<p>
The PowerPC processors can issue multiple instructions at once. You therefore may<br>
think they'll tear through your code, executing many instructions per cycle. While<br>
this is sometimes true, a number of hurdles keep the PowerPC processors from<br>
completing even one instruction per cycle. These hurdles include instruction cache<br>
misses, data cache misses, and processor pipeline stalls.
</p>
<p>
What may surprise you is how often the processor sits idle because of these hurdles. I<br>
did some tests and found that while opening new windows in one popular application, a<br>
Power Macintosh 8500's processor completed an average of only one instruction for<br>
every two cycles. This is not very efficient, considering its PowerPC 604 processor<br>
can complete up to four instructions per cycle.
</p>
<p>
Much of that inefficiency is from instruction and data cache misses. As PowerPC<br>
processors reach faster clock rates, these cache misses will have an increasing<br>
impact. By minimizing cache misses we could realize a significant performance<br>
improvement.
</p>
<p>
Simply recompiling your 680x0 code to native PowerPC code doesn't typically<br>
generate efficient code. Many designs and data structures for the 680x0 architecture<br>
work very poorly when ported to PowerPC code. When you port native, you should<br>
carefully examine your code. Tuning for a cached RISC architecture is very different<br>
than for the 680x0 family. Here are some important things to consider:
</p>
<ul>
<li>    Redesign your data structures. Use long word-sized elements. Keep<br>
commonly used elements together, and keep everything aligned on double long<br>
word boundaries.</li>
<li> Keep results in local variables, instead of recomputing or calling<br>
subroutines to retrieve global variables.</li>
</ul>
<h2>BETTER PROFILING</h2>
<p>
Until recently you couldn't measure cache misses unless you had a logic analyzer or<br>
other expensive hardware. The PowerPC 604 processor, however, includes an<br>
extremely useful performance measurement feature: two special registers (plus a<br>
register to control them) that can count most events that occur in the processor. Each<br>
of these registers can count about 20 events, and there are five basic events that both<br>
registers can count.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are just a few examples of what you can count with these registers: integer<br>
instructions that have completed; mispredicted branch instructions; data cache<br>
misses; and floating-point instructions that have been issued.
</p>
<p>
To use the performance profiling that the PowerPC 604 processor provides, you'll<br>
need to have one of the newer Macintosh models that include this processor, such as the<br>
Power Macintosh 9500 or 8500. This will cost less than a logic analyzer yet allow<br>
you to get detailed performance profiles.
</p>
<p>
Although these registers will show your software's performance only on a 604-based<br>
Power Macintosh, your software's cache usage and efficiency should be similar on<br>
other PowerPC processors. Use the 604's special abilities to profile your code and<br>
you'll benefit on all Power Macintosh models.
</p>
<p>
For more accurate performance measurements, you may want to use the DR Emulator<br>
control panel, which is provided on this issue's CD. With this control panel you can<br>
turn off the dynamic recompilation feature of the new emulator; this feaure, which is<br>
described in the Balance of Power column in Issue 23, can affect the performance of<br>
your tests over time.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Also provided on the CD</b> is the POWER Emulator control panel. This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control panel lets you turn off the Mac OS support for RS/6000 POWER<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructions and thus check for these instructions in your code (they'll cause a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crash).*
</p>
<h2>THE 4PM PERFORMANCE TOOL</h2>
<p>
To use the new 604 performance registers, you don't need to program in PowerPC<br>
assembly language. On this issue's CD we've included a prototype application called<br>
4PM. This tool, which was developed by engineer Tom Adams in Apple's Performance<br>
Evaluation Group, uses the PowerPC 604-specific registers to provide various types<br>
of performance data.
</p>
<p>
4PM is very simple to use. It presents three key menus: Control, Config, and Tests, as<br>
shown in Figure 1. You use these menus to select the type of performance measurement<br>
and an application you'd like to run the tests on. The application you're testing is<br>
launched by 4PM, and you can gather data either continuously or, using a "hot key,"<br>
exactly when you want.
</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 1. 4PM menus</b>
</p>
<p>
Once a test completes, 4PM fills a window with the results -- a tabular summary with<br>
a different test run on each line. The Save command in the File menu will write the<br>
results to a file of type 'TEXT'.
</p>
<p>
<b>The Control menu. </b>Use the Launch command in this menu to select an application<br>
and run it, gathering the test data specified with the Config or Tests menu. The default<br>
configuration will measure cycles and instructions completed between when the<br>
application launches and when it quits. The Launch Again command simply relaunches<br>
the last application you tested.
</p>
<p>
Check Use Hotkey if you'd like to control exactly when data is gathered. With this<br>
option, you start and stop collecting data by holding down the Command key while<br>
pressing the Power key. (This key combination is the same way to force entry to<br>
MacsBug, which you'll be unable to do during the tests.)
</p>
<p>
The Repeats command is just a shortcut that's handy if you're repeating a test multiple<br>
times. If you specify a repeat value with this command, your test application will be<br>
relaunched that many times after you quit it.
</p>
<p>
The Intervals command allows you to collect data points at regular intervals; a dialog<br>
box offers the choices 10 milliseconds, 100 milliseconds, 1 second, or Other.<br>
Normally just a total is collected, but by specifying an interval time you'll instead<br>
receive a spreadsheet of timings. This will show what your code's performance was as<br>
the test progressed.
</p>
<p>
<b>The Config menu. </b>The commands in the Config menu allow you to tailor the test data<br>
by specifying exactly which events each register will count. The Count Select command<br>
lets you specify the machine states to collect data in; set this to "User Only" since<br>
you'll be tuning application code.
</p>
<p>
<b>The Tests menu. </b>The commands in the Tests menu are for generating typical<br>
reports. Use the calibrate command to count the five basic events that are common to<br>
both 604 performance registers, including cycles and instructions completed; with<br>
this test selected, the Launch command will run your application five times,<br>
successively counting each of these events. You can use one of the remaining tests to<br>
collect more specific measurements. The caches, load/store, execution units, and<br>
special instructions tests each generate a report for the corresponding aspect of 604<br>
performance. The Describe command displays a window describing which events are<br>
counted in the selected test. Use the New command to create your own tests. These new<br>
tests are automatically saved; you can use the Delete command to remove any that<br>
you've added.
</p>
<h2>ASSEMBLY USAGE</h2>
<p>
If you want finer results, you should read and write to the 604 performance registers<br>
directly. This requires writing in PowerPC assembly language, but it allows you<br>
complete control over what data you'll collect for your time-critical code.
</p>
<p>
You'll be accessing three new special-purpose registers: MMCR0, PMC1, and PMC2.<br>
MMCR0 controls which events will be recorded and when exactly to record. The<br>
performance monitor counter registers, PMC1 and PMC2, are the registers in which<br>
you'll read the results. I'll give a brief summary of how to use these registers, but<br>
you'll need to read Chapter 9 of the PowerPC 604 RISC Microprocessor User's Manual<br>
for details.
</p>
<p>
MMCR0 is a 32-bit register that specifies all the options for performance<br>
measurement. Most of these options aren't important to your application profiling, and<br>
you should at first leave the high 19 bits of MMCR0 set to 0. The low 13 bits,<br>
however, specify which events you want counted in PMC1 and PMC2. Bits 19 through<br>
25 select PMC1, and bits 26 through 31 select PMC2. See Chapter 9 of the 604 user's<br>
manual to learn which specific bits to set.
</p>
<p>
Here's an example of how to measure data cache misses per instruction:
</p>
<pre>.eq PMC1_InstructionsCompleted   2 << 6
.eq PMC2_DataCacheMisses         6
.eq MMCR0_StopAllRecording      $80000000

   li         r0, MMCR0_StopAllRecording
   mtspr      MMCR0, r0     ; stop all recording
   li         r0, 0
   mtspr      PMC1, r0      ; zero PMC1
   mtspr      PMC2, r0      ; zero PMC2
   li         r0, PMC1_InstructionsCompleted +
                PMC2_DataCacheMisses
   mtspr      MMCR0, r0     ; start recording</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Notice that we load MMCR0 with only the most significant bit set to turn off all<br>
recording. This holds PMC1 and PMC2 at their current values and allows us to also<br>
zero PMC1 and PMC2 before we start recording. When you're done measuring, follow<br>
with this code:
</p>
<pre>   li         r0, MMCR0_StopAllRecording
   mtspr      MMCR0, r0    ; stop all recording
   mfspr      PMC1, r3     ; r3 is number of
                           ; instructions completed
   mfspr      PMC2, r4     ; r4 is data cache misses</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Notice again that we turn off recording before reading the results. Otherwise the very<br>
act of reading the registers would affect the results; it will slow your code slightly,<br>
since the mtspr and mfspr instructions take multiple cycles to complete.
</p>
<p>
Don't record over very long periods of time, because the PMC1 and PMC2 registers can<br>
overflow. To measure over long periods, you should periodically read from the<br>
registers, add the result to a 64-bit number in memory, and clear the registers to<br>
prevent this overflow.
</p>
<p>
Don't ship any products that rely on these performance registers. They're supported<br>
only in the current 604 processor, and they're not part of the PowerPC architecture<br>
specification.
</p>
<h2>COMPLACENCY</h2>
<p>
The moral is the same as for my tale of the square parachutes: question satisfaction.<br>
Don't become complacent about the performance of your new native PowerPC<br>
applications. The profiling tools described here should help you more accurately<br>
measure and identify bottlenecks in your PowerPC code. Use that information to tune<br>
-- especially paying attention to memory usage -- and you'll be surprised how much<br>
faster your product will run. Macintosh users consistently hunger for faster<br>
computers and more responsive software; spend some serious time tuning, and they'll<br>
thank you for it.

<b>DAVE EVANS </b>likes to go skydiving when he can get away from his job gluing together<br>
the Mac OS software at Apple. He has gone a few times now, but he'll always cherish the<br>
memory of his first jump. Friends on the ground that day claim to have clearly heard<br>
his scream, although he was nearly a mile above them when he left the plane. On his<br>
second leap, if he hadn't opened the chute while upside down and then watched it deploy<br>
through his legs, he might have noticed more of the surrounding countryside.
