<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>

<h1>CAROLINE ROSE</h1>
<p>
I was visiting my friends Helen and John one night when Helen started telling me how<br>
excited about the World Wide Web John had become. He said, "Ask me anything at all,<br>
and I can find the answer for you." I asked what the new U.S. postal rate for<br>
international air mail was, knowing it had recently gone up from $.50. He delighted<br>
over finding a&nbsp;&nbsp;Web page for the Postal Service, and quickly found the rate: $.50.<br>
Wrong.
</p>
<p>
Later John showed me a spiffy magazine called NewMedia, and in it an article by<br>
longtime hypertext&nbsp;&nbsp;proponent Ted Nelson. Nelson expressed his joy that, with HTML<br>
and the&nbsp;&nbsp;Web, hypertext's time has finally come; we can now leave the insanity of<br>
"paper simulation" behind and write in a way that lets&nbsp;&nbsp;information take on its truer,<br>
interconnected form.
</p>
<p>
I found the article, and John's enthusiasm over the&nbsp;&nbsp;Web, a bit disconcerting. The Web<br>
is indeed a boon to humankind, but I don't see it entirely replacing what came before.<br>
The world's love affair with the Web reminds me of the early days of TV (so I'm told),<br>
when many people were sure that radio was dead. Out with the old, in with the new. But<br>
in fact the old still had its place in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The virtues of the&nbsp;&nbsp;Web don't mean we no<br>
longer need to get information from flesh and blood people sometimes,&nbsp;&nbsp;or from books<br>
and other media that we can hold in our hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;This may seem obvious, but from the<br>
near hysteria&nbsp;&nbsp;surrounding the Web these days, I'm not sure it is.
</p>
<p>
A few days after my visit with Helen and John, with John still smarting from his failed<br>
demonstration of the wonderfulness of the Web, Helen called and mentioned that she<br>
needed the lyrics to "House of the Rising Sun." I could hear John in the background,<br>
tapping away as he searched for them online. I said I'd use old technology and call back<br>
with them soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;The race was on.
</p>
<p>
After looking through my looseleaf binders full of song lyrics and a couple of big<br>
songbooks, I dug through my tapes and found an ancient recording of&nbsp;&nbsp;Woody Guthrie<br>
singing the song. After lots of rewinding and transcribing, I had more verses than<br>
Helen ever dreamed existed.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I triumphantly called back, John (several levels<br>
down in the Library of Congress) was mortified.
</p>
<p>
While old technology will typically not beat Web browsers in the search for nuggets of<br>
information, it will not die, and it deserves proper respect.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some things<br>
we'll learn only through person-to-person contact. And there are emotions we'll<br>
experience only from hearing or reading good old-fashioned sequential deliveries. The<br>
World Wide Web is a valuable resource, but it is not, after all, the world.

CAROLINE ROSE&nbsp;&nbsp;(AppleLink CROSE) enjoys editing develop so much that she fears she<br>
may for get to retire someday. She started out in technical writing and editing eons ago,<br>
eventually moving on to programming and even management before returning to her<br>
original calling. What seems to be calling her now is&nbsp;&nbsp;the sea: Her last vacation took<br>
her up to Puget Sound (stalking wild elk on the Olympic Peninsula on the way), and<br>
her next will be in a sailboat in the Bahamas. She may even have the opportunity to<br>
cruise the Pacific in a few years but she's not sure she' ll be ready to leave develop,<br>
her cat, or terra firma. *
