<h1>Newton Q &amp; A: Ask the Llama</h1>
<b>Q</b><i>I have a program that communicates with the desktop. Part of the information sent is</i><br>
<i>real numbers. I've found functions to stuff almost every other type of data into a</i><br>
<i>binary object except real numbers. How do I do that?</i><br>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have two choices. First, you could just print the real number as a string<br>
(using SPrintObject), send the string, and convert it back on the other side. Clearly<br>
this isn't a good idea if you want to maintain a high degree of precision. The other<br>
choice is to construct the correct type of binary object for the target desktop machine.<br>
In other words, take the Newton real representation and convert it into, say, IEEE<br>
floating point. Then you can use BinaryMunger to stuff the binary object into whatever<br>
packet of data you're constructing.
</p>
<p>
Note that Newton uses SANE representation for real numbers that are in the<br>
representable range. However, the representation of exceptions (such as NAN and<br>
infinity) are different and undocumented. At this time you should avoid converting<br>
these types of real numbers.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Can you give me a short and clear description of the different types of Newton</i><br>
<i>memory?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three important "pools" of so-called internal memory, each with<br>
different tradeoffs.
</p>
<p>
The NewtonScript heap (about 90K to 96K on current devices) is where all the<br>
runtime data from NewtonScript lives. Any result from the Clone family of calls will<br>
take up NewtonScript heap space. The view frame made at run time from your<br>
application templates will take up this heap space. NewtonScript heap space is very<br>
precious, so you should try to use as little of it as possible, especially when your<br>
application's base view isn't open.
</p>
<p>
The user store (192K in the MessagePad 100, larger on other devices) is where<br>
application packages stored internally live, and where soups are located. The entries in<br>
the soups are located in this space. While not quite as precious as the NewtonScript<br>
heap, this space can certainly run out. This is the space that's "extended" when a RAM<br>
PCMCIA card is inserted.
</p>
<p>
There is also some system heap space, which is used for, well, everything else. The<br>
viewCObjects and drawing objects live here. Recognition uses memory from here. You<br>
can run out of this space (in which case you get the Cancel/Restart dialog) but it's less<br>
of a programming issue.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>I have an application that uses a protoRollBrowser. When I expand the items, they</i><br>
<i>have lines separating them. I can't seem to get rid of them. Is this a bug?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you're seeing is part of the default definition of a protoRollItem. It includes a<br>
1-pixel border. You can remove that border by modifying the viewFormat of your<br>
rollItems. In addition, you may want to set the fill to white.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>I'm using a protoRoll (not protoRollBrowser) in my application. But it never shows</i><br>
<i>up. What's the problem?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need to give it a viewFlags slot and make sure the Visible bit is checked. The<br>
default is Application and Clipping, but this won't make the protoRoll visible if it's<br>
included inside another view.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>I have a text view that the user can use to enter text. I wanted to extend a selection. I</i><br>
<i>knew the insertion caret was at the end of the selection, so I called SetHilite(newPoint,</i><br>
<i>newPoint, nil), where newPoint is the new position for the selection extension, but I</i><br>
<i>got no highlight. What's going wrong?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behavior is actually perfectly correct. There's a not quite obvious interaction<br>
between the caret and SetHilite. As shown in the table below, how SetHilite behaves<br>
depends on four things: the start and end character positions (the first two arguments)<br>
being equal, the value of unique (the third argument), the presence of a previously<br>
highlighted selection, and the presence of the caret. Note that the following explanation<br>
refers to the case of a single paragraph view, in which there can be only one selection;<br>
if there are multiple paragraph views, it's possible (with unique nil) to have multiple<br>
discontiguous selections.

<b>Q</b><i>I have an application that uses ADSP to connect to a server on the desktop. I want the</i><br>
<i>server to handle multiple Newtons connected simultaneously. Unfortunately, if a</i><br>
<i>connection fails after it's opened, the server doesn't seem to be able to identify it as a</i><br>
<i>new connection when the Newton reconnects. This causes problems in the server's</i><br>
<i>ability to handle multiple connections. Can you help?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll assume that the Newton tries to reconnect shortly after losing the<br>
connection. In that case, the Newton doesn't generate a new connection ID, so your<br>
server probably acts as if the connection didn't close, while the Newton is acting as if<br>
it's establishing a new connection. Currently the only solution is to force the Newton to<br>
wait three minutes after an improper disconnect before trying to reconnect.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>I have a communications program that always sends a string of the same size to the</i><br>
<i>desktop. The string is quite large, and I would like to preallocate it and fill it with a</i><br>
<i>particular value. What's the best way to do this?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with all things in programming, the answer is a tradeoff between space and<br>
time. Let's assume that you want a string of 2K characters filled with the character A,<br>
and that you control the contents of the string (that is, if you get user input, you make<br>
sure the input is a string). The first option is to allocate the string at compile time.<br>
Note that you shouldn't allocate your string constant with a double-quoted string ("a<br>
string"), since typing 2K (less the terminator) characters is monotonous and error<br>
prone. The way to allocate the string is with the following SetLength trick:
</p>
<pre>constant kNumberOfUnicodeCharsForString := 2048;   // 2K chars
DefConst('kMyBigString, call func()
   begin
      // SetLength uses bytes; Unicode chars are 2 bytes each
      local aStr := SetLength("",
            2 * kNumberOfUnicodeCharsForString + 2);
      // initialize the string
      for i := 0 to k1KUnicodeChars - 1 do
         aStr[i] := $A;
      return aStr;
   end with ());</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
At run time you can clone kMyBigString and do what you need to fill it with characters.<br>
Note that the object is not a string; you would need to use StuffByte to put in individual<br>
characters.
</p>
<p>
The advantage of this method is that it's very fast: it averages less than one tick (60th<br>
of a second) for the clone. The disadvantage is that it puts a 4K object in your package<br>
(Unicode strings are two bytes per character). If you can't afford the 4K in your<br>
package, you need to generate the string at run time. Using the above code at run time<br>
averages 52 ticks.
</p>
<p>
Another possible runtime method is to use smart strings, which allow you to<br>
preallocate strings and concatenate them in a more efficient way. The first attempt at<br>
doing this seems to be inefficient, at an average of 175 ticks:
</p>
<pre>// defined constant somewhere in your project
constant  kNumberOfUnicodeCharsForString := 2048;

local s := SmartStart(2 * kNumberOfUnicodeCharsForString + 2);
local l := 0;
for i := 1 to kNumberOfUnicodeCharsForString do
   l := SmartConcat(s, l, "A");
SmartStop(s, l);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
However, simply concatenating two characters at a time reduces the average to 88<br>
ticks; four characters reduces it to 44; and so on. A lesson here is that testing and<br>
measurement are your friends.
</p>

<b>Q</b><i>I'd like to train my dog to code in NewtonScript. How can I do that?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm afraid the prospect isn't promising. Dr. J. L. Fredericks at SITAP (Stanford<br>
Institute for Training Animal Programmers) has been trying for ten years to train<br>
different animal species to program computers. Although he's had some success<br>
training dogs to do simple programs, he says, "Anything more than a simple statement<br>
is beyond them. No loops, no conditionals." Besides which, paws don't work well for<br>
moving mice. For Newton programming the best he has been able to achieve is training<br>
a rat to reset the Newton on command. As Dr. Fredericks says, "Never underestimate<br>
the usefulness of a ratset."
