&nbsp;As described in Chapter 3 of <i>Inside Macintosh: QuickTime</i> , the Image Compression<br>
Manager performs compression and decompression by invoking image compressor and<br>
decompressor components.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These components, called<i>codecs</i> , present a standard<br>
interface to the Image Compression Manager using the Component Manager. But each<br>
codec is unique because each implements a different compression and decompression<br>
algorithm. Codecs can vary greatly in the three major characteristics that are used to<br>
judge image compression algorithms: compression ratio, compression speed, and image<br>
quality. QuickTime 2.0 ships with eight codecs that can be selected for use by your<br>
QuickTime application under various conditions. In addition, users or third-party<br>
products can install custom codecs into the system by simply placing them in the<br>
Extensions folder. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;With all the choices for image compression and decompression, the only way to choose<br>
the best codec for a particular purpose is to have some understanding of all the codecs<br>
available on your system. <i>Inside Macintosh</i> provides general descriptions of the<br>
standard QuickTime codecs, but detailed information is important in making an<br>
intelligent codec selection. The way to find this detailed information is to communicate<br>
programmatically with the codec and request its capabilities through the codec call<br>
CDGetCodecInfo. As described in<i>Inside Macintosh: QuickTime Components,</i> this call<br>
returns a compressor information structure. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;For example, information about what pixel depths a compressor supports for storing<br>
image data is important to choosing the right codec. If your application creates and<br>
compresses a picture, the decision of whether to create the picture in 8-bit, 16-bit,<br>
or 32-bit color can be based partially on what pixel depths the compressor supports.<br>
If the compressed data can store only 16 bits of color information, it would be<br>
inefficient to create a picture with 32 bits of color. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Accompanying this column on this issue's CD is the sample application<br>
GetCodecInfoApp, which (by calling CDGetCodecInfo) allows you to easily obtain<br>
detailed information about codecs installed in your system. I'll discuss GetCodecInfoApp<br>
and point out some characteristics that should be considered in choosing a codec. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;USING CODECS</b><br>
There are actually two separate parts to a codec: one for the compression and one for<br>
the decompression. Not all codecs provide both; nevertheless, all compressor and<br>
decompressor combinations are referred to as codecs. One example of a<br>
decompression-only codec is the codec that comes with the QuickTake 100 digital<br>
camera from Apple. The hardware in the QuickTake 100 camera performs the<br>
compression and downloads compressed data to the Macintosh. The Macintosh only needs<br>
to perform decompression. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;A compressor is a component of type compressor-ComponentType ('imco') and a<br>
decompressor is a component of type decompressorComponentType ('imdc'). Detailed<br>
information on writing a codec is provided in Chapter 4 of<i>Inside Macintosh: QuickTime</i><br>
<i>Components</i> . But to select the appropriate codec to use, you don't need to do any<br>
programming; you can simply use GetCodecInfoApp, without any need to understand<br>
how it was written. This application creates a text file containing a report of all the<br>
codec components installed in your system. For example, the output for the Cinepak<br>
codec looks like this:
</p>
<pre>Compressor Name: Cinepak
------------------------------------
- version = 1
- revisionLevel = 1
- vendor = appl
- compressionAccuracy = 128
- compressionLevel = 128
- minimum height = 1
- minimum width = 1
- compress pipeline latency = 0
- compression capabilities:
    directly compresses 32-bit pixel maps
    supports temporal compression
    can recompress images without accumulating errors
    can rate constrain to caller defined limit
- compression format:
    can store images in 24-bit color
    can store images in 8-bit grayscale
    can store custom color table
    compressed data requires non-key frames to be
          decompressed in same order as compressed
- estimated compression speed:
640x480 32-bit RGB = 11485 milliseconds

Decompressor Name: Cinepak
------------------------------------
- version = 1
- revisionLevel = 1
- vendor = appl
- decompressionAccuracy = 128
- minimum height = 1
- minimum width = 1
- decompress pipeline latency = 0
- decompression capabilities:
    directly decompresses into 32-bit pixel maps
    supports temporal compression
    can recompress images without accumulating errors
    can rate constrain to caller defined limit
- decompression format:
    can decompress images from 24-bit color
          compressed format
    can decompress images from 8-bit grayscale
          compressed format
    can store custom color table
    compressed data requires non-key frames to be
          decompressed in same order as compressed
- estimated decompression speed:
640x480 32-bit RGB = 56 milliseconds</pre>
<p>
GetCodecInfoApp gets information about codecs by calling the codec's CDGetCodecInfo<br>
function, which all codecs must support; if you're writing a codec, it's important to<br>
report your capabilities with this function. To measure the codec's speed, the<br>
application actually passes it an image to compress or decompress, and reports the<br>
result. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;The Image Compression Manager function </b>GetCodecInfo can also be used to<br>
obtain information about codecs, but only for compressor codecs; you won't be able to<br>
get information about decompression-only codecs with GetCodecInfo. *
</p>
<p>
An example of a characteristic you can determine with GetCodecInfoApp is what pixel<br>
depths the decompressor can decompress directly into. This is important because it<br>
affects the speed of the image decompression. If the codec can't decompress directly<br>
into the destination pixel map, the Image Compression Manager will have to<br>
decompress into an offscreen buffer and move the image data into the destination after<br>
converting the pixel depth. This results in additional memory and processor bandwidth<br>
requirements. If you know exactly what pixel depths a decompressor supports, you can<br>
set up the destination for the best performance.
</p>
<p>
Most codecs support only a limited number of pixel depths for the compressed data<br>
storage format.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Video Compressor will store image data only in<br>
16-bit color. If you compress a 32- bit color image, you'll lose information, since the<br>
compressed format will store the equivalent of 16 bits of data. The pixel depth for the<br>
compressed data storage format also determines which of the different compression<br>
settings are available -- for example, the pixel depth pop-up menu for Compression<br>
Settings displayed by the standard image-compression dialog component (used, for<br>
example, by Picture Compressor, an application that's part of the QuickTime Starter<br>
Kit) will only allow you to choose Color for the Video Compressor. The Animation<br>
Compressor is one of the few compressors that will store compressed data in nearly all<br>
pixel depth formats: Black and White, 4 Grays, 4 Colors, 16 Grays, 16 Colors, and so<br>
on. 
</p>
<p>
When compressing movies, you'll often want to select a codec that supports temporal<br>
compression; not all codecs do. <i>Temporal compression</i> is the use of frame differencing<br>
to compress consecutive image frames by skipping data that doesn't change from frame<br>
to frame. Temporal compression is useful only for sequences of images stored as<br>
QuickTime movies. Knowing which codecs support temporal compression will allow<br>
you to choose the best codec for compressing sequences. 
</p>
<p>
If you're compressing pictures with scientific data, it may be extremely important<br>
that there be no image quality loss. In this case, you'll want to look for a codec that<br>
supports<i>lossless</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;compression. For example, the Photo Compressor (JPEG codec) is a<br>
lossy codec because even at the highest quality setting, there may still be some loss of<br>
image quality. On the other hand, the Animation Compressor is lossless at higher<br>
quality settings and will preserve every pixel value. 
</p>
<p>
There are many additional features a codec may support that are important to know.<br>
For example, certain codecs will support data spooling so that only portions of the<br>
compressed data need to be read into memory at any one time. This can be a<br>
requirement when working with very large compressed images that will be displayed<br>
in systems with limited memory. Another example is support for stretching to double<br>
size during decompression. This is extremely useful, since the performance is much<br>
greater if the scaling is performed during decompression rather than as a separate<br>
step after decompression. 
</p>
<p>
<b>SOME RECOMMENDATIONS</b><br>
For most video clips, the Cinepak Compressor is the recommended codec. As you can see<br>
from GetCodecInfoApp's report, this codec is very slow in compression. However, its<br>
decompression speed and compression level are excellent, making it the best choice for<br>
most video data for CD-ROM playback.
</p>
<p>
An alternative to Cinepak is the Video Compressor. Since its compression speed is<br>
fairly quick, it's better for an application that requires fast compression. 
</p>
<p>
If your source material is animation graphics in a movie, there are several<br>
compressors that may do the job. The Animation Compressor and Graphics Compressor<br>
may be equally suitable. In this case, you may need to experiment to determine which<br>
is the best codec to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if you're compressing photo images, the Photo<br>
Compressor is the best codec to use. It has only moderate compression and<br>
decompression speed, but the compression ratio and quality are excellent and the<br>
compression ratio scales accordingly with image quality. If you want better image<br>
quality at the expense of larger compressed data size, you can easily achieve this with<br>
the Photo Compressor. 
</p>
<p>
<b>PRESSING ON</b><br>
If you're writing a codec, you can see from this column that it's very important to<br>
properly report the codec's capabilities; GetCodecInfoApp may be useful for you to<br>
verify that your codec is doing this properly. For the rest of you, I hope this column<br>
has provided some insight on how to choose the right codec for producing the best<br>
movies and compressed images.

his entire day waiting for MPW to compile code that he's writing in his software<br>
engineering role in the Image Capture group. Just in case you fail to notice, we're sure<br>
he'd like us to point out that he makes a gratuitous plug for his group's product, the<br>
