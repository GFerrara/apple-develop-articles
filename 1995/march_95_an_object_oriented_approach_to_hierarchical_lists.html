<h2>An Object-Oriented Approach to Hierarchical Lists</h2>
<h1>JAN BRUYNDONCKX</h1>

<p>
<i>The article "Displaying Hierarchical Lists" in </i> develop<i> Issue 18 showed how to use the</i><br>
<i>List Manager to build and display lists of hierarchical data with triangular</i><br>
<i>"twist-down" buttons for expanding and collapsing sublists (similar to the ones the</i><br>
<i>Finder uses for displaying and hiding the contents of folders in a list view). In this</i><br>
<i>article, we take an object-oriented approach to implementing these and other custom</i><br>
<i>lists, using the PowerPlant application framework by Metrowerks. Using subclass</i><br>
<i>inheritance to build small classes on top of each other makes incremental development</i><br>
<i>easy and straightforward.</i>
</p>
<p>
Recently, I found myself working on a project that needed hierarchical lists: a remote<br>
debugger for a network-based software distribution application. The product,<br>
FileWave, creates a "virtual disk" volume on the user's client machine and manages its<br>
contents remotely from a central server. The debugger, called TheRaven, can retrieve<br>
file and folder information from the client machine and display it in a Finder-like<br>
hierarchical view (see Figure 1).
</p>
<p>
Martin Minow's article "Displaying Hierarchical Lists" (<i>develop</i> Issue 18) was an<br>
excellent starting point, but Martin's implementation had some features that made it<br>
unsuitable for my particular application. Most important, Martin built his<br>
hierarchical lists completely in memory before displaying them -- not very practical<br>
when working over a network. I could have modified Martin's code to remove that<br>
restriction, but the result wouldn't have been very clean. Since we were using the<br>
object-oriented PowerPlant application framework by Metrowerks, I decided to try to<br>
develop an object-oriented implementation for hierarchical lists.
</p>
<p>
One of the advantages of object-oriented programming is that it enables you to build up<br>
your implementation in incremental steps. PowerPlant's collection of small,<br>
independent classes can be combined to build new classes with rich features, providing<br>
a strong foundation for software development. And, of course, using PowerPlant gave<br>
me an opportunity to try out the great Metrowerks CodeWarrior programming<br>
environment.
</p>
<p>
This issue's CD contains some of the results of my development efforts. On it, you'll<br>
find a collection of general-purpose classes for implementing lists with icons,<br>
hierarchical lists, and other useful possibilities. You can use these as a basis for<br>
developing more specialized subclasses of your own; the CD includes some examples of<br>
those, as well.

<b>&nbsp;The CD contains </b>two project files: one for creating a 680x0 application and one for<br>
the native PowerPC version. In both projects, only the main segment contains my own<br>
code; all the other source files are taken from the PowerPlant development<br>
framework.*
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;This article assumes that you understand the List Manager and how to use it, and that<br>
you have at least a casual acquaintance with object-oriented programming in general<br>
and C++ in particular.
</p>
<h2>&nbsp;BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS</h2>
<p>
In PowerPlant, everything that appears on the screen is a<i>pane,</i> an instance of the<br>
built-in class LPane. Like a view in MacApp, a pane can be anything from a plain<br>
rectangle to a scroll bar, a picture, or a radio button. A control is a pane, as is an icon<br>
button, a static text item, or a scrolling picture. Even LWindow, the class to which<br>
windows themselves belong, is a subclass of LPane.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Typically, a window consists of an instance of class LWindow with one or more<br>
subpanes derived from LPane. In our examples, our windows will have only one pane,<br>
an instance of PowerPlant's built-in class LListBox. This type of pane uses the<br>
Macintosh List Manager to display a list of objects. Each of our examples will define a<br>
new subclass of LListBox with additional or modified properties and behavior. All it<br>
takes to define such a class is to select an existing class, override its drawing method<br>
(and maybe a couple of others), and possibly create a new resource template.
</p>
<h2>&nbsp;EASY LISTS</h2>
<p>
Our first example implements a simple window showing the list of words "One"<br>
through "Five" (see Figure 2). This may not seem like a big deal, but it's a good<br>
illustration of the power of object- oriented programming.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/133.gif" width="338 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2. </b>An easy list
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;If we started from scratch, how many lines of code would this application take? Well,<br>
we'd have to set up a menu, create a window, and then write an event loop to handle<br>
dragging, window resizing, and so on. Add in the List Manager calls, and we'd be lucky<br>
to do it all in fewer than 100 lines. With PowerPlant, all those details are handled for<br>
us by the predefined class LApplication. All we need to do is define a subclass,<br>
CListApp, with a menu command for creating our list window. One line of code in our<br>
subclass's ObeyCommand method suffices to create the window:
</p>
<pre>LWindow::CreateWindow(EasyList_PPob, this);</pre>
<p>
This invokes a static method of class LWindow to create the window from a template<br>
resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EasyList_PPob is the resource ID; the exact description of the window is<br>
contained in the resource, isolated from the code itself.
</p>
<p>
The resource definitions (Listing 1) give the details on the window's structure and<br>
appearance. The familiar window template resource ('WIND') is accompanied by a<br>
PowerPlant object resource ('PPob') giving extra information on the window and the<br>
panes it encloses (see "'PPob' Resources").&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'PPob' is simply a list of views and<br>
panes, each specified with the keyword ObjectData. Panes can be nested to any depth,<br>
with each new level delimited by the keywords BeginSubs and EndSubs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our case,<br>
the window view encloses just one pane, representing the list box.
</p>
<p>
An object-oriented application framework like PowerPlant is so powerful that these<br>
two resources are all we need to describe our window and its list pane. With just one<br>
line of code to create the window, we get all the standard behavior for free: dragging<br>
and resizing the window, scrolling the list, and selecting items with the mouse. We can<br>
have multiple windows with the same list, and can use the List Manager for<br>
manipulations like adding or removing items.
</p>
<p>
But, of course, we won't stop there. In the following examples, we'll override the<br>
standard behavior by creating a series of subclasses. The resources in each case will<br>
be minor variations on the ones in Listing 1; the main difference is that we'll use a<br>
subclass instead of one of the standard classes.
</p>
<p>

            {302, 202},                     // {width, height}

            textList,                       // LDEF ID
            {"One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five"}
                                            // some sample data
        }},
    EndSubs {}</pre>
<h2>CUSTOM LISTS</h2>
<p>
The previous example used the standard behavior of PowerPlant's built-in class<br>
LListBox. We can make our list much more attractive by adding an icon in front of each<br>
element. To do this, we'll define two new subclasses of LListBox.
</p>
<p>
Actually, one subclass would have been enough to do the job. But the most important<br>
thing I learned in my university software engineering courses was, "Be a toolsmith."<br>
Following this advice, I've chosen to define two subclasses instead of just one. The<br>
first, CCustomListBox, is a versatile, general-purpose tool that allows a list to hold<br>
any kind of data instead of just text. The items in the list can be structures of<br>
arbitrary size holding any kind of information we want. The CCustomListBox class<br>
includes methods for displaying this information easily and conveniently.
</p>
<p>
The second subclass, CMyCustomListBox, is just a demo class to show off the<br>
capabilities of the first.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It inherits the general behavior of CCustomListBox and<br>
specializes it to hold two pieces of information for each list item: an icon (actually,<br>
just the icon's resource ID) and a piece of text (see Figure 3).

<p>
<b>'PPOB' RESOURCES BY AVI RAPPAPORT</b>
</p>
<p>
Resources of type 'PPob' (PowerPlant object) represent objects that belong to<br>
PowerPlant's predefined class LPane and its derived subclasses. Their structure is<br>
fully described in the section "Creating Panes" (Chapter 9 in the August 1994<br>
release) of the PowerPlant manual supplied on the CodeWarrior CD. Each 'PPob'<br>
resource describes an entire containment hierarchy -- for example, an enclosing<br>
pane, then a scrollable "view," scrollers, and the window's buttons, list boxes, text<br>
fields, and radio button groups. You can also add new types to represent your own<br>
custom subclasses of LPane.
</p>
<p>
Object layering makes 'PPob' resources too complex for ResEdit's template<br>
mechanism, so you have to use Apple's Rez, Metrowerks' PowerPlant Constructor<br>
(provided on the CodeWarrior CD), or Mathemaesthetics' Resorcerer&nbsp;&nbsp;to edit them. The<br>
listings in this article are in Rez format. Note that Rez files must be compiled<br>
separately to be included in a CodeWarrior project, as the current version of<br>
CodeWarrior cannot compile them automatically.
</p>
<p>
Resorcerer provides a forms-based interface. To use it, copy the file PowerPlant<br>
Resorcerer TMPLs from the PowerPlant Resources folder to Resorcerer's Private<br>
Templates folder. The 'PPob' editor will be available the next time you start<br>
Resorcerer.
</p>
<p>
PowerPlant Constructor uses more of a point-and-click interface to display the user<br>
view for each object in a 'PPob' resource. You can edit the values in the Attributes<br>
palette and Field windows and view the results on the screen. For instructions on the<br>
specific menu items involved, see the <i> Constructor User's Guide</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;on the CodeWarrior<br>
CD. Using PowerPlant and the 'PPob' resources together, you can create clean,<br>
standard interfaces for your programs, using the best of Apple's new technologies. This<br>
allows you to be more creative about the design of your programs and concentrate on<br>
adding new features to make the best possible applications.
</p>
<p>
<b>CREATING A LIST</b><br>
The template ('PPob') resource for our list pane has the same format as the standard<br>
one shown in Listing 1, but without the sample data (the strings "One" through<br>
"Five"), since we're now allowing the list to contain any kind of data instead of just<br>
text. This time, though, we want the window's list pane to be an instance of ourcustom<br>
class, CMyCustomListBox, instead of PowerPlant's predefined class LListBox. 
</p>
<p>
The job of creating a new window at run time from a template resource is handled by a<br>
part of the PowerPlant system called the<i>reanimator.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i> We need to tell the reanimator<br>
to use our own creator method when creating the window's list pane from the template,<br>
in place of the standard one for class LListBox.
</p>
<p>
We establish the connection between our template resource and the creator method that<br>
will use it by assigning the template a unique<i>tag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i> We then register the tag with the<br>
PowerPlant<i>registrar,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;telling it to associate that tag with a particular creator method.<br>
We create the tag by adding the line
</p>
<pre>ClassAlias {'mlst'},</pre>
<p>
to our 'PPob' resource, before the definition of the list pane. (All we need is an alias,<br>
because the resource defining our custom class has the same structure as that of the<br>
standard LListBox class.) We then define a constant to represent this tag in our<br>
CMyCustomListBox class:
</p>
<pre>public:
    enum {
        classID = 'mlst'
};</pre>
<p>
Now we can register the tag with the PowerPlant registrar as part of our application's<br>
initialization code:
</p>
<pre>URegistrar::RegisterClass(CMyCustomListBox::classID,
        (ClassCreatorFunc) CMyCustomListBox::CreateFromStream);</pre>
<p>
(A convenient place to do this is in our application object's constructor method,<br>
CListApp::CListApp.) Later, when we use our template to create a new object --
</p>
<pre>LWindow::CreateWindow(CustomList_PPob, this);</pre>
<p>
-- PowerPlant's reanimator will recognize the tag and will call the specified creator<br>
method, CMyCustomListBox::CreateFromStream, to create an instance of our class. We<br>
define the creator method as follows:
</p>
<pre>CMyCustomListBox* CMyCustomListBox::CreateFromStream (LStream
*inStream)
    {
        return (new CMyCustomListBox(inStream));
    }</pre>
<p>
This simply passes along the parameter it receives, inStream, to the class constructor<br>
method, CMyCustomListBox::CMyCustomListBox. This method in turn calls the<br>
superclass constructor method, CCustomListBox::CCustomListBox, and then adds some<br>
further initialization of its own:
</p>
<pre>CMyCustomListBox::CMyCustomListBox(LStream *inStream) :
        CCustomListBox(inStream)
{
     // Additional initialization for class CMyCustomListBox
    ...
}</pre>
<p>
The extra initialization code calls the Macintosh List Manager to add cells to the list<br>
and initializes the contents of each cell. In some cases (though not in this example), it<br>
might need to read in additional resource data. This is also the ideal place to initialize<br>
the new object's member variables.
</p>
<p>
<b>CUSTOMIZING THE LIST DEFINITION PROCEDURE</b><br>
The List Manager calls a<i>list definition procedure</i> to display each cell of a list on the<br>
screen (see<i>Inside Macintosh: More Macintosh Toolbox,</i> Chapter 4). The procedure is<br>
supplied as a code resource of type 'LDEF'. In our case, we want to keep the display code<br>
inside the application, so that we can define it as a method of our custom subclass.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates our scheme for accomplishing this.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/135.gif" width="357 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 4. </b>Customizing the list definition procedure
</p>
<p>
The LDEF that we supply to the List Manager is just a stub that calls the real one<br>
defined in our application. We use the refCon field of the list record to hold a "callback<br>
pointer" to the real definition procedure; the userHandle field holds a pointer back to<br>
the list object. The initialization method CCustomListBox::init sets all this up:
</p>
<pre>if (callerLDEFUPP == NULL)
    // Create UPP for LDEF callback.
    callerLDEFUPP = NewListDefProc(LDefProc);

// Put callback address in refCon.
(*mMacListH)-&gt;refCon = (long) callerLDEFUPP;

// Keep a pointer to self.
(*mMacListH)-&gt;userHandle = (Handle) this;</pre>
<p>
mMacListH is a member variable of LListBox containing a handle to the list record.<br>
First we create a universal procedure pointer (UPP) to our callback function,<br>
LDefProc, and store it in the list record's refCon field; then we save a pointer to the<br>
list object itself ("this") in the userHandle field.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we load the stub LDEF from<br>
the resource file, save its handle in the listDefProc field of the list record, and make it<br>
unpurgeable from the heap.
</p>
<p>
Listing 2 shows the code of our callback function and the subsidiary methods it calls.<br>
The callback function, LDefProc, sets up the A5 world, looks in the list's data for the<br>
contents of the cell to be drawn, and calls the list object's member function<br>
DrawElement to draw it. DrawElement clears the cell's rectangle to prepare for<br>
drawing, makes sure that the cell's contents aren't empty, and calls another member<br>
function, DrawElementSelf, to do the actual drawing. Then DrawElement checks its<br>
lSelect parameter to see whether to highlight the cell and, if so, inverts the cell's<br>
rectangle.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 2. </b>Custom list definition procedure for CCustomListBox
</p>
<pre>static pascal void LDefProc (short lMessage, Boolean lSelect,
                             Rect *lRect, Cell lCell,
                             unsigned short lDataOffset,
                             unsigned short lDataLen,
                             ListHandle lHandle)
// Custom list definition procedure for CCustomListBox.
// Called by the LDEF stub; returns control back to class method
// DrawElement to do the actual drawing.
{
    // Ignore init and dispose messages.
    if ((lMessage == lInitMsg) || (lMessage == lCloseMsg))
        return;

    // Set up application's A5 so that we can access global
    // variables.
    long savedA5 = ::SetCurrentA5();

    // Get pointer to list object from userHandle field of list
    // record.
    CCustomListBox *self =
        (CCustomListBox*) (*lHandle)-&gt;userHandle;

    // Get handle to cell data.
    Handle h = (*self-&gt;mMacListH)-&gt;cells;
    char saveState = ::HGetState(h);
    ::HLock(h);

    // Find and draw cell contents.
    void *lElement = (void*) (*h + lDataOffset);
    self-&gt;DrawElement(lMessage, lSelect, lRect, lElement, lDataLen);

    // Restore previous handle state and A5.
    ::HSetState(h, saveState);
    ::SetA5(savedA5);
}

                                  const Boolean lSelect,
                                  const Rect *lRect,
                                  const short lDataLen)
// Member function for responding to LDEF calls.
// Calls DrawElementSelf to draw a list element.
{
    switch (lMessage) {

        case lDrawMsg:
            ::EraseRect(lRect);
            if (lDataLen == 0)
                break;
            DrawElementSelf(lRect, lElement, lDataLen);
            if (!lSelect)
                break;
        case lHiliteMsg:
            ::InvertRect(lRect);
            break;
    }
}

void CCustomListBox::DrawElementSelf (const Rect *lRect,
                                      const void *lElement,
                                      const short lDataLen)
// Draw contents of a single list element on the screen.
// Default version just draws text; override for other types of data.
{
    ::MoveTo(lRect-&gt;left + 2, lRect-&gt;top + 9);
    ::DrawText(lElement, 0, lDataLen);
}</pre>
<p>
The default version of DrawElementSelf, defined in our CCustomListBox class, just<br>
draws a simple piece of text for the contents of a cell. More specialized subclasses,<br>
such as CMyCustomListBox, can override this method to draw other types of cell<br>
contents or to display them in different ways. (In unusual cases, a subclass might want<br>
to override the calling method, DrawElement -- to redefine the way highlighting is<br>
done, for example.) Both DrawElement and DrawElementSelf are defined as virtual<br>
methods, ensuring that all calls are directed to the proper version for a particular<br>
class of list.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows our application to support list boxes of many different kinds<br>
simultaneously, with each going through the same general LDEF, but ultimately calling<br>
its own specialized version of the drawing method.
</p>
<p>
As an example, Listing 3 shows the DrawElementSelf method for our class<br>
CMyCustomListBox.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each cell of the list displays both a small icon and a text label, as<br>
we saw earlier in Figure 3. The cell data in the List Manager's list record structure<br>
consists of the icon's resource ID (resource type 'SICN') and a Pascal-format string<br>
specifying the text:
</p>
<pre>typedef struct {
    short   iconID;
    Str255  name;
} MyCustomDataRec, *MyCustomDataRecPtr;</pre>
<p>
The DrawElementSelf method calculates a 16-by-16-pixel rectangle for the icon,<br>
plots it with CopyBits, and then draws the text. There's no need to override the<br>
DrawElement method, since the standard form of highlighting is all we need.
</p>
<h2>HIERARCHICAL LISTS</h2>
<p>
Our next example is a hierarchical "twist-down" list like those in Martin Minow's<br>
Issue 18 article.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our version lacks a few of the more advanced features of Martin's<br>
-- for instance, it can't accommodate script systems like Hebrew and Arabic by<br>
displaying its twist-down buttons on the right instead of the left -- but it's essentially<br>
similar. The important implementation difference is that a sublist doesn't have to be<br>
present in memory before it's displayed: the contents are fetched when the sublist is<br>
expanded.

Figure 5 shows the basic data structure representing a twist-down list. Each cell has<br>
an indentation level and a flag byte, followed by a variable-length field holding the<br>
cell's data. The kHasSubList flag in the flag byte tells whether the cell has a sublist<br>
associated with it; if so, the kIsOpened flag indicates whether the sublist is currently<br>
open (expanded) or closed (collapsed). Cells with a sublist will be drawn with a<br>
triangular twist-down button pointing to the right if the sublist is currently closed,<br>
or down if it's open.
</p>
<p>
To expand or collapse a cell's sublist when the user clicks the triangular button, we<br>
override the list's ClickSelf method (inherited from the built-in PowerPlant class<br>
LListBox). Expanding a cell adds new cells to the list following it, with an indentation<br>
level that's 1 greater than its own. Collapsing a cell scans forward through the list and<br>
removes all immediately succeeding cells with higher indentation levels. The detailed<br>
code is too involved to show here, but if you're interested, you can find it on the CD in<br>
the file CTwistDownListBox.cp.

<b>Figure 5. </b>Structure of a hierarchical list

<p>
Listing 4 shows the redefined version of the DrawElementSelf method, inherited from<br>
CCustomListBox. First we check the cell's flags to see if it has a sublist; if so, we draw<br>
the triangular button in the appropriate form, depending on whether the sublist is<br>
open, closed, or in transition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual drawing of the cell's contents is factored out<br>
into a separate method, DrawTwistedElement: this allows subclasses to override just<br>
the drawing routine itself, without having to duplicate the logic for drawing the<br>
triangle as well.
</p>
<p>
<b>A SIMPLE EXAMPLE</b><br>
The class CMyHierListBox is a subclass of CTwistDownListBox, strictly for<br>
demonstration purposes. It isn't a particularly realistic example, but it does show how<br>
to specialize CTwistDownListBox to implement a simple hierarchical list. Each level of<br>
the hierarchy just consists of the words "One" through "Five" (see Figure 6). Every<br>
cell automatically has a sublist; you can keep opening sublists as long as you like, to<br>
unlimited depth (or until you run out of memory, anyway!).

<p>
The only method CMyHierListBox needs to redefine is ExpandElement (see Listing 5).<br>
The new version simply adds five new rows of dummy data following the cell being<br>
expanded. We don't have to override any other methods, since the superclass,<br>
CTwistDownListBox, already implements text elements by default. (For simplicity and<br>
clarity, we've simply hard-coded the words "One" through "Five" directly into the<br>
program itself; in real life, we would want to define them as resources to make<br>
modification and localization easier.)

<p>
<b>A MORE INTERESTING EXAMPLE</b><br>
This example is borrowed directly from Martin Minow's article. CMyDiskListBox is a<br>
subclass of CTwistDownListBox that displays the folder and file hierarchy on all<br>
currently mounted disk volumes, with each line preceded by a small icon as in our<br>
earlier CMyCustomListBox example (see Figure 7).
</p>
<p>

                     "\pOne", "\pTwo", "\pThree", "\pFour", "\pFive"
                 };

void CMyHierListBox::ExpandElement (const Cell theCell)
{
    short             num = sizeof(myElements) / sizeof(StringPtr),
                      i,
                      indent = 0;
    Cell              cell = {0, 0};
    Byte              buffer[100];
   
    TwistDownRecPtr thisTwist =

    TwistDownRecPtr anElement = (TwistDownRecPtr) buffer;

    }

<p>
<b>Figure 7. </b>A disk list
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The following structure contains the data for each cell of the list:
</p>
<pre>typedef struct {
    TwistDownHeader hd;
    long            refNum;
    char            vRefNum;
    Byte            tag;
    char            name[2];
} DiskListRec, *DiskListPtr;</pre>
<p>
The data structure in the first field, TwistDownHeader, is inherited from the<br>
superclass (CTwistDownListBox) and contains the indentation level and the flag byte.<br>
Next come the file and volume reference numbers. The tag byte identifies this item as<br>
either a file, a folder, or a volume.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name field actually has variable length: when<br>
drawing the cell's contents, we know the total length of the cell data, so we can deduce<br>
the true length of the name.
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Space is at a premium </b>when dealing with the List Manager, because of its 32K<br>
limit on the total size of a list record and its associated cell data. That's why we've<br>
saved a little space in the definition of the DiskListRec structure by making the<br>
vRefNum field a character instead of a short integer. This sacrifices a bit of speed<br>
when retrieving or storing the volume reference number, but avoids wasting an extra<br>
byte for word alignment. For the same reason, we also specify 68000 alignment in our<br>
Power Macintosh implementation.*
</p>
<p>
Because CMyDiskListBox draws more than just text in each cell of the list, it must<br>
override the DrawTwistedElement method inherited from CTwistDownListBox. Listing<br>
6 shows the new version, which reads in the appropriate small icon from the system<br>
resource file, calls a subsidiary function, PlotSICN, to draw it, and then draws the text<br>
to go with it.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We also need to override the ExpandElement operation to look up the contents of a<br>
folder, using the file system calls PBHGetVInfo and PBGetCatInfo, and insert them in<br>
the list. (Our constructor method calls this same function to initialize a newly created<br>
list to the set of currently mounted volumes.) You'll find the code for this operation in<br>
the file CMyDiskListBox.cp on the CD. The new ExpandElement method doesn't allocate<br>
memory or do anything else that needs to be cleaned up later, so there's no need to<br>
override its companion method, CollapseElement.
</p>
<p>
There's a change in the resource file, too: instead of just using a class alias, as we did<br>
for our other example classes, we define our own resource template for<br>
CMyDiskListBox.
</p>
<pre>case DiskListBox:
    key literal longint = 'dlst';
    PP_ListBoxData;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This definition is placed in a separate<i>template file,</i> which must be defined in the tool<br>
server script and exported, so that it will be included with PowerPlant's own<br>
templates. We can then refer to our template by name when defining the 'PPob'<br>
resource in our main resource description (.r) file:
</p>
<pre>ObjectData {DiskListBox {
    ...
}}</pre>
<p>
In this case, defining our own template yields the same results as using a class alias,<br>
so it's just a matter of taste. But if you want flexibility, defining your own templates<br>
is the way to go: you can add or change existing resource definitions to suit your own<br>
classes. Just look at the various LPane subclass implementations in PowerPlant to see<br>
how easy it is!

<h2>YOU TAKE IT FROM HERE</h2>
<p>
I hope you can see by now that the object-oriented approach makes it easy to define<br>
new kinds of hierarchical lists for your applications. The examples in this article are<br>
just a starting point: the rest is up to you. 
</p>
<p>
If you're a true object aficionado, you'll want to make your list elements full-fledged<br>
objects instead of just simple data structures. You could modify our disk list example<br>
to display its icons in color instead of black and white, or to use each application or<br>
document's actual icon instead of the generic ones from the system resource file. Or<br>
how about letting the user drag and drop files from one folder to another within the list<br>
box? (PowerPlant provides predefined classes to support drag and drop, so building it<br>
into your application is easier than you might think. I know, because I've done it.)
</p>
<p>
The possibilities are limited only by your imagination. So get to work and see what<i>you</i><br>
can dream up!
