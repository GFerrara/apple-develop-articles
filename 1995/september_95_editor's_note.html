<h1>CAROLINE ROSE</h1>
<p>
On this issue's CD, all the files that used to be in Apple DocViewer format have been<br>
converted to AdobeTM AcrobatTM. Based on feedback that we've gotten from many of you<br>
since we started using DocViewer, we trust you'll be happy with this change.&nbsp;&nbsp;You<br>
should find that Acrobat has better search fea- tures and resolves some other<br>
problems. Because conversion is faster, the information can be more timely. Also, the<br>
files take up less space. So we hope you're satisfied -- but you probably won't be for<br>
very long. It's just not the nature of the computer-using beast.
</p>
<p>
Think about it: How long after you get an upgrade to some software or hardware<br>
product do you start looking ahead to the next version?&nbsp;&nbsp;With the old problems solved<br>
and your old needs satisfied, you go on to realize a set of new ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to<br>
computers, we always want more, and better.
</p>
<p>
I remember when the Macintosh was first designed, Steve Jobs kept saying it was to be<br>
an appliance, like a toaster: you simply plug it in and it does what you want, reliably<br>
and without fuss. (We're not talking multi- attachment Cuisinart here.) As you no<br>
doubt recall only too well, the options to add to the functionality of the first Macintosh<br>
were intentionally limited. It was to be a simple "black box" ("beige box"?).
</p>
<p>
Now, I know you're glad that that era didn' t last very long, but think for a moment<br>
about all those non-nerds out there who haven't yet seen fit to buy a computer -- all<br>
those potential customers Jobs was hoping to attract. They write things and add up<br>
numbers sometimes just like we do, don't they? So what are they waiting for?
</p>
<p>
I think the problem is that they want toasters -- machines that work year after year<br>
without always needing to be updated, upgraded, or extended. They see the computer as<br>
a moving tar get, constantly advancing to satisfy some relatively insignificant new<br>
needs they never even knew they had -- doomed to instant obsolescence. Better they<br>
should use a pen or pencil.
</p>
<p>
I suff er from this attitude myself to some degree, at least when I'm wearing my Home<br>
User hat.&nbsp;&nbsp;There I use a little old Macintosh with old but reliable software that works<br>
every time I do the paperwork on it that I've been doing for ten years now. But at<br>
Apple, I become a Computer Professional monster with ravenous needs for the latest<br>
and greatest software and hardware -- downright insatiable. 
</p>
<p>
So enjoy it while you can: have your fill of our new Acrobat files or whatever<br>
innovation pleases you these days. But rest assured that you'll be hungry again in no<br>
time.

CAROLINE ROSE&nbsp;&nbsp;(AppleLink CROSE) resisted learning anything about computers in<br>
college, where she majored in math, but she couldn't escape them in the real world.<br>
First she used gigantic IBM machines at her statistical research job in Manhattan. But<br>
California beckoned, and with it came terminals spewing yellow paper and, eventually,<br>
computers with display screens.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a big "Wow!" at first, but now Caroline <br>
gets her excitement from non-computer endeavors, such as travel. On her trip this<br>
year to the Big&nbsp;&nbsp;Island of Hawaii, she kayaked among (breaching)&nbsp;&nbsp;humpback whales<br>
and watched lava flow down cliffs and into the Pacific. Hard to top that! *
