</p>
<p>
I've been thinking lately about the purpose of this column, which debuted in the<br>
previous issue of develop. Permit me to take a moment to say something about that<br>
before I get down to some tips about dictionaries.
</p>
<p>
During the first couple of years after the birth of the Macintosh, there was a period of<br>
chaos, when application developers were figuring out how to extend the basic user<br>
interface. For example, some of the most commonly used menu commands appeared in<br>
different locations in various applications, and, more important, keyboard shortcuts<br>
varied or sometimes weren't present at all. After a while, though, things settled down<br>
and almost everyone adopted the standards that were eventually documented in the<br>
Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines.
</p>
<p>
AppleScript is the alternate user interface to your application. Now that AppleScript<br>
has been available for two years, it's time to move out of the "free-for-all" and<br>
develop the same consistency we've all come to enjoy and expect from the Macintosh<br>
experience. That's what this column (and the work I do in the AppleScript development<br>
community) is all about -- encouraging consistency. The tips I offer here reflect<br>
undocumented conventions followed by many developers I've worked with, as well as<br>
my own thinking about scriptability. Until the time when standards are documented in<br>
a "Macintosh Human Scriptability Guidelines," I encourage you to adopt the techniques<br>
suggested here.
</p>
<p>
Though I've said it before, I'll say it one more time: adopting the object model is the<br>
single most important factor contributing to consistency in the AppleScript language<br>
across applications of different types. One developer I know resists using the object<br>
model year after year, arguing that it "isn't appropriate for everything." But the fact<br>
is that the object model&nbsp;&nbsp;has been successfully applied to a whole range of applications.<br>
Every major C++ framework now supports it or has add-ons to support it, and<br>
up-and-coming languages will support it. Even if your application has only one object<br>
(such as the dictionary of a small paging program I've seen), just do it!
</p>
<h2>ORGANIZING YOUR DICTIONARY</h2>
<p>
So far in the scripting world, various developers have used different schemes in their<br>
dictionaries for organizing the events in a suite, the parameters in an event, the<br>
properties in an object, and so forth. Some organize them according to their function,<br>
others&nbsp;&nbsp;order them alphabetically, and still others don't seem&nbsp;&nbsp;to have any scheme<br>
whatsoever (probably because scripting support was added a bit at a time or as an<br>
afterthought). For the sake of consistency across different scriptable applications,<br>
using some standard scheme is preferable.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're including an entire standard suite (such as&nbsp;&nbsp;the Core suite) from<br>
AppleScript's system dictionary (listed in the Rez files named EnglishTerminology.r,<br>
FrenchTerminology.r, and so on) and then overriding or extending the suite to add your<br>
own terms, make sure that your overrides appear in the same order as they do in the<br>
system dictionary and that extensions come after all the overrides. If you're<br>
implementing your own terminology, either as extensions to existing suites or in your<br>
own suites, organize it as described in the following paragraphs.
</p>
<p>
When you're adding new terms to a previously created dictionary (for example, when<br>
upgrading your application to provide deeper scripting support), remember to insert<br>
the new terms according to the same scheme or schemes you originally implemented.<br>
It's a good idea to keep some notes in your internal design documents describing the<br>
ordering schemes&nbsp;&nbsp;you used, so that you can be consistent with your earlier work<br>
(unless you're redoing your scripting implementation from scratch -- for instance,<br>
when you're converting from an old non-object model implementation to the object<br>
model).
</p>
<p>
<b>Suites. </b>So that your dictionary is consistent with dictionaries in other applications,<br>
include the standard Registry suites first (Required suite first, then the Core suite,<br>
then any other Registry suites). Then include any custom suites you create.
</p>
<p>
<b>Events. </b>Order commands that correspond to events in one of four ways: by likelihood<br>
of use, according to function, chronologically, or alphabetically. The method you choose<br>
will depend on how your application is used and the nature of your users. As an<br>
example of each of these schemes, I'll show how some of the Core suite verbs might be<br>
organized.
</p>
<p>
If certain commands are to be used more frequently than others, order them according<br>
to likelihood of use. Present those commands that will be used most frequently at the<br>
beginning and those seldom used at the end:
</p>
<p><table border="0"><tr><td>get</td><td>(more of these than anything else)</td></tr>
<tr><td>set</td><td>(quite a few of these, too)</td></tr>
<tr><td>count</td><td>(a fair amount of counting)</td></tr>
<tr><td>make</td><td>(sometimes new objects are created)</td></tr>
<tr><td>open</td><td>(sometimes they're opened)</td></tr>
<tr><td>close</td><td>(and closed)</td></tr>
<tr><td>print</td><td>(printing isn't done as frequently)</td></tr>
<tr><td>delete</td><td>(neither is deleting)</td></tr>
<tr><td>quit</td><td>(quitting is done only occasionally)</td></tr></table></p>

<p>
If your users will logically group the operations, use an ordering according to<br>
function. Group together commands that are related in some way:
</p>
<p><table border="0"><tr><td>make</td><td>(make and delete)</td></tr>
<tr><td>delete</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>open</td><td>(open and close)</td></tr>
<tr><td>close</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>set</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>(set and get)get</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>count</td><td>(the rest are unrelated)</td></tr>
<tr><td>print</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>quit</td><td></td></tr></table></p>

<p>
If the commands are normally used in a certain order, choose a chronological ordering.<br>
First present the commands that will be used first, followed by the commands that will<br>
be used later:
</p>
<p><table border="0"><tr><td>make</td><td>(this often comes first)</td></tr>
<tr><td>open</td><td>(or else opening comes first)</td></tr>
<tr><td>set</td><td>(then setting properties)</td></tr>
<tr><td>get</td><td>(and later getting properties)</td></tr>
<tr><td>count</td><td>(counting comes in the middle)</td></tr>
<tr><td>print</td><td>(printing happens later)</td></tr>
<tr><td>close</td><td>(then comes closing)</td></tr>
<tr><td>delete</td><td>(deleting is near the end)</td></tr>
<tr><td>quit</td><td>(last, we bail out)</td></tr></table></p>

<p>
If the commands aren't going to be used in any particular order, or you don't know<br>
what that order is likely to be, and there's no logical grouping, list the commands<br>
alphabetically, as the Core suite does. Although alphabetical order isn't as helpful as<br>
the other schemes, script writers will at least be able to find commands more easily in<br>
your application's dictionary.
</p>
<p>
<b>Parameters.</b> Make an effort to list parameters in&nbsp;&nbsp;an order that encourages the<br>
writing of natural, grammatically correct sentences for commands. For example:
</p>
<pre>make   new  &lt;TYPE CLASS&gt;
      [at  &lt;LOCATION REFERENCE&gt;]
      [with data  &lt;ANYTHING&gt;]
      [with properties  &lt;RECORD&gt;]</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If the order of an event's parameters doesn't matter as far as sentence style is<br>
concerned, order them according to the frequency of likely use.
</p>
<pre>close  &lt;REFERENCE&gt;
      saving  &lt;YES ="no|ask"&gt;
      saving in  &lt;FILE SPECIFICATION&gt;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Object classes and properties.</b> I'd suggest placing the outermost objects in your<br>
containment hierarchy first, objects contained in the outermost objects next, and<br>
objects that don't contain any other objects last. Remember that every object class<br>
representing an actual object must be listed as an element of some other object,<br>
eventually leading back to the application class (the null container). Primitive class<br>
definitions and record definitions (which aren't part of the containment hierarchy)<br>
and abstract classes (which aren't instantiable objects but are used to hold lists of<br>
inherited properties) should be placed in the Type Definitions or Type Names suite,<br>
and clearly labeled as a record definition or abstract class. (See my article, "Designing<br>
a Scripting Implementation," in <i>develop</i> Issue 21.)
</p>
<p>
Properties of objects can be ordered according to one of the schemes described above<br>
for events.
</p>
<h2>WHEN YOU ALLOW MULTIPLE VALUE TYPES</h2>
<p>
Occasionally in your dictionary you might need to specify a parameter or property for<br>
which any of several types is acceptable. Using the wild card ('****') as the type of a<br>
parameter or property tells your user that you'll accept anything (or at least a wide<br>
variety of mixed types). Don't do this to be lazy or to finish your dictionary quickly;<br>
do it only if you mean it. If you accept only one type, explicitly indicate so. If you allow<br>
two different types, you can either create a compound "type" or use identical keyword<br>
entries.
</p>
<p>
<b>Defining a compound "type." </b>One way of handling cases where you can accept two<br>
different value types for a parameter or property is to make up a new "type" to<br>
represent a combination of acceptable types in your dictionary. This isn't a real type<br>
that you'd have to check for or deal with in your application's code, but instead just<br>
serves to indicate in your dictionary that your application will handle either type.<br>
This works particularly well when the value types are simple. For example:
</p>
<pre>class reference or string: Either a reference or
   a name can be used.</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You can use your new "type" in a parameter or property definition as follows:
</p>
<pre>class connection
properties:
   window  &lt;REFERENCE OR STRING&gt;  -- the
      connection's window can be referred to
      either by a reference or by its name</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To define a new type, make a new object class and place it in the Type Names suite (see<br>
my article in Issue 21).
</p>
<p>
<b>Using identical keyword entries. </b>You can also use multiple entries with<br>
identical keywords to specify alternative ways of filling in a parameter or property<br>
value. This works well when the value types are complex or are highly dissimilar. For<br>
example, the display dialog command has two with icon listings, one for specifying the<br>
icon by its resource name or ID and the other for displaying the stop, note, or caution<br>
icon:
</p>
<pre>display dialog  &lt;ANYTHING&gt;  -- title of dialog
   ...  other parameters
   [with icon  &amp;lg;ANYTHING&gt;]  -- name or id of the
      icon to display
   [with icon  &lt;STOP ="note|caution"&gt;]  -- or display
      one of these system icons</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Note the use of "or" in the second entry's comment: make sure you use the same 4-byte<br>
ID for both parameter entries.
</p>
<p>
Although you could have many entries to show every possible individual type that a<br>
parameter or property takes, this might become confusing to the user. So I'd<br>
recommend that you use this sparingly, and when you do use it, try to limit the<br>
number of similar entries to 2.
</p>
<h2>MAKING USE OF THE COMMENT AREA</h2>
<p>
You can use the comment area (available for each suite, event, parameter, class, and<br>
property entry) to help clarify how your vocabulary is to be used. Since your<br>
dictionary is often the initial "window" through which a user looks to figure out what<br>
to do, descriptive comments can make the user's task a lot easier. And remember that<br>
your users aren't necessarily programmers, so you should avoid terms like FSSpec&nbsp;&nbsp;in<br>
your comments. I'll give some examples to show&nbsp;&nbsp;you what I mean.
</p>
<ul>
<li>For Boolean parameters and properties, if there are two possible states,<br>
include a description of the true and false conditions, such as "true if the<br>
script will modify the original images, false if the images will be left alone."</li>
<li>If the possible states are on and off, you need only include the true<br>
condition ("If true, then screen refresh is turned on") or ask a question ("Is<br>
the window zoomed?").</li>
<li>For enumerations, include a general description of what the parameter or<br>
property represents; the individual enumerators should be self-explanatory.<br>
For example, "yes|no|ask -- Specifies whether or not changes should be saved<br>
before closing."</li>
<li>Don't use the comment field to explain a set of possible numeric values<br>
when an enumeration (with descriptive enumerators) is better. Instead of<br>
"0=read, 1=unread, ..." use "read|unread|..."</li>
<li>For compound "types," describe the parameter or property, as well as the<br>
choices for value types listed: "the connection's window (either a reference or<br>
name can be used)."</li>
<li>For "anything" (unless you actually allow any type the user can think of),<br>
describe which specific types you allow: "[... descriptive info] (a string, file<br>
reference, alias, or list is allowed)."</li>
<li>If you allow either a single item or a list, indicate so: "the file or list of<br>
files to open."</li>
<li>If the parameter or property has a default value (used when the user<br>
doesn't include an optional parameter or set the property), mention it (this<br>
applies to values of any type): "replacing yes|no|ask -- Replace the file if it<br>
exists? (defaults to ask)."</li>
</ul>
<p>
Keep in mind that if you include an entire standard suite (such as the Core or Text<br>
suite), your own comments should reflect the style of the comments in that suite. See<br>
the Scriptable Text Editor's dictionary as an example of fairly good comment style; it<br>
shows the standard versions of the Required, Core, and Text suites and adds some of its<br>
own terminology.
</p>
<h2>A COUPLE MORE DICTIONARY TIPS</h2>
<p>
While I'm on the subject of dictionaries, here are a couple of extra tidbits. Use only<br>
letters and numbers for terms in dictionaries. Don't use a hyphen (-), a slash (/), or<br>
any other nonalphanumeric characters in your dictionary entries. For example, if you<br>
use Swiss-German, AppleScript will treat it as Swiss - German (subtraction), which<br>
is not what you want; if you use Read/write, it will be treated as Read / write<br>
(division). Note that Read/write is in the standard Table suite, but it won't compile<br>
properly.
</p>
<p>
All terms must start with letters. Using 9600 as an enumerator won't work; you<br>
would have to use something like baud9600.
</p>
<p>
Finally, pick names for your terms that are descriptive for a user, especially a<br>
nonprogrammer. If you pick a term like x, users won't be allowed to use x as a<br>
variable name in their scripts. For instance, instead of "x &lt;small integer&gt; -- the x<br>
coordinate" use "horizontal coordinate &lt;small integer&gt; -- the x coordinate."
</p>
<h2>IT'S YOUR THING</h2>
<p>
Unlike writing code, designing a scripting vocabulary isn't an exact science. It's up to<br>
you to decide in what manner (and how effectively) humans will interact with this new<br>
interface. Applying "programming language" concepts and standards won't always<br>
work. You need to keep an eye toward the human aspects of the AppleScript language<br>
and to work out a scheme that reflects careful attention to your users.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may occasionally see guidelines here that aren't completely clear-cut or that<br>
even conflict with each other, and every so often I'll adjust what I've said in&nbsp;&nbsp;an earlier<br>
column. This is the nature of an evolving language. If you're not completely at home<br>
with this, seek out an expert in scriptability design for advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;But remember,<br>
vocabulary design is by nature as much art as science.
