<h1>Newton Q &amp; A: Ask the Llama</h1>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>The on-line discussion groups for Newton developers have a lot of references to</i><br>
<i>compatibility these days. My application works fine on the 120, 110, and 100 models.</i><br>
<i>Does that mean I'm compatible?</i></p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Good question. Compatibility doesn't mean your application works now, but that<br>
it's written in such a way that it will work on future Newton devices and operating<br>
systems. There are several APIs and methods for doing things on the 120, 110, and<br>
100 models that will work with them but are not necessarily compatible with future<br>
releases of the operating system.</p>
<p>
There are two main points to observe for the sake of compatibility:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If it's not documented, don't use it.</li>
<li>Catch exceptions; they <i>can</i> occur (especially if you ignore the first<br>
point).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since compatibility is such an important question, it will be the focus of this column.<br>
The rest of the column will cover the most common breaches of compatibility. Where<br>
applicable, there will be an example of the incompatible and compatible ways of doing<br>
things. After reading this and making copious notes (especially where you find<br>
yourself saying "Oh dear" and "Oh no!"), you'll be in a position to make your code<br>
compatible. We also recommend that you try out your application with the<br>
Compatibility App Package (which is on this issue's CD and is available from various<br>
on-line services).
</p>
<p>
Note that we refer often to the Newton Toolkit platform file functions. The Toolkit<br>
documentation and platform file release notes describe these functions, which are<br>
provided in lieu of future APIs. You should use these platform file functions where<br>
applicable. Call the code directly and don't modify it. That is, use the call/with syntax;<br>
don't place the code in a slot in your application and use message sending.
</p>
<p>
<b>UNDOCUMENTED GLOBAL FUNCTIONS</b>
</p>
<p>
There are four common offenders here: CreateAppSoup, SetupCardSoups, MakeSymbol,<br>
and GetAllFolders. The function kRegisterCardSoupFunc in the platform file replaces<br>
CreateAppSoup and SetupCardSoups. It's much simpler to use than the undocumented<br>
functions:
</p>
<pre>// RIGHT way
constant kSoupName := "MySoup:MYSIG";
constant kSoupIndices := '[];
constant kAppObject := '["Item", "Items"];
call kRegisterCardSoupFunc with
   (kSoupName, kSoupIndices, kAppSymbol, kAppObject);

// *** WRONG way ***
CreateAppSoup(kSoupName, kSoupIndices, EnsureInternal([appSymbol]),
   EnsureInternal(kAppObject));
AddArraySlot(cardSoups, kSoupName);
AddArraySlot(cardSoups, kSoupIndices);
SetupCardSoups();</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The fix for MakeSymbol is to call the Intern function: it does the same thing as<br>
MakeSymbol and it's documented.
</p>
<p>
There's no replacement function for GetAllFolders; just don't call it.
</p>
<p>
<b>UNDOCUMENTED GLOBAL VARIABLES</b>
</p>
<p>
The three most common misused global variables are <b>cardSoups</b>, <b>extras</b>,<br>
and<b>userConfiguration</b>.
</p>
<p>
There are two uses of <b>cardSoups</b>: one is to register a card soup; the other to<br>
unregister it. Registering is taken care of with kRegisterCardSoupFunc (see above).<br>
Unregistering is done with another platform file function, kUnRegisterCardSoupFunc:
</p>
<pre>// RIGHT way
call kUnRegisterCardSoupFunc with (kSoupName);

// *** WRONG way ***
SetRemove(cardSoups, kSoupName);
SetRemove(cardSoups, kSoupIndices);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You should never access the <b>extras</b> global variable. Not only is this variable<br>
undocumented, but so is its format. Both are subject to major revisions. The platform<br>
file function kSetExtrasInfoFunc is provided for setting information about items in the<br>
extras drawer. The most common use of this function is to give your application a<br>
different icon (see the ExtraChange DTS sample code on the CD).
</p>
<p>
There are also platform file functions to manipulate <b>userConfiguration</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>kGetUserConfigFunc gets a slot from the userConfiguration soup entry.</li>
<li>kSetUserConfigFunc lets you set user configuration information.</li>
<li>kFlushUserConfigFunc should be called when you've changed user<br>
configuration information.</li>
</ul>
<pre>// RIGHT way
local userName := call kGetUserConfigFunc with ('name);
if userName then
begin
   if StrEqual(userName, "Doctor") then
      call kSetUserConfigFunc with ('name, "The Doctor");
   call kFlushUserConfigFunc with ();
end;

// *** WRONG way ***
if userConfiguration.name AND
      StrEqual(userConfiguration.name, "Doctor") then
   userConfiguration.name := "The Doctor";</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>UNDOCUMENTED SLOTS AND METHODS</b>
</p>
<p>
This is a broad category of problems. The most common is <b>keyboardChicken</b> in the<br>
root view. But there are others, like <b>cursor.current</b>,<br>
<b>paperRoll.dataSoup</b>,<b>dockerChooser</b> in the root view, <b>UnionSoup:Add</b>, and<br>
anything in a built-in application. Unfortunately, there is no right way to access most<br>
of these. The exceptions are <b>cursor.current</b> and <b>Add</b>.
</p>
<pre>// RIGHT way
local currentEntry := cursor:Entry();
myUnionSoup:AddToDefaultStore(anEntry);

// *** WRONG way ***
local currentEntry := cursor.current;
myUnionSoup:Add(anEntry);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Also, don't rely on the routing slips, such as <b>mailSlip</b> and <b>printSlip</b>, being in the<br>
root view. You can, however, still use those symbols in your routing frame.
</p>
<p>
<b>UNDOCUMENTED MAGIC POINTERS</b>
</p>
<p>
If you use one of these, you know it. Just think what would happen if the magic pointer<br>
changed from a view to a string: you would get some pretty bad behavior. Note that<br>
most of this could be dealt with by catching exceptions.
</p>
<p>
<b>STORE AND SOUP ASSUMPTIONS</b>
</p>
<p>
All you can assume is that store 0 is the internal store. You can't rely on there being<br>
only one other store, nor can you rely on the position of a store in the array returned<br>
by GetStores. Also, don't assume that another store is a card or even that there is just<br>
one store per card.
</p>
<p>
If you support moving or copying items between stores, you shouldn't find the title of<br>
the store. Use the constant ROM_cardAction as provided in the platform file:
</p>
<pre>// RIGHT way
routingFrame := {
   print: ...
   ...
   card: ROM_cardAction
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In addition, don't assume that your soup will exist on every store. Currently, if you<br>
register your union soup, it's automatically created on every store that enters the<br>
Newton; however, this may change in the future:
</p>
<pre>// RIGHT way
GetUnionSoup(kSoupName):AddToDefaultStore(anEntry);

// *** WRONG way ***
aStore:GetSoup(kSoupName):Add(anEntry);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Remember that AddToDefaultStore or Add could throw exceptions. Wrap your calls to<br>
these functions in exception handlers.
</p>
<p>
Finally, if you support the soup change mechanism, don't assume that the change is<br>
adding or deleting an entry. It could be something else, such as a soup being created or<br>
removed from a store.
</p>
<p>
<b>SCREEN SIZE</b>
</p>
<p>
Don't assume the screen is any particular size. It could be larger or smaller than<br>
current devices. It could also be wider than it is tall. Your application size setup<br>
routine (usually in the viewSetupFormScript) should take this into account. Have<br>
maximum and minimum sizes. Close your application if it can't handle the current<br>
screen size.
</p>
<pre>// Code to close your application
constant kUnsupportedScreenSize :=
   "WiggyWorld does not support this screen size";

DefConst('closeMeFunc, func(x) x:Close());

:Notify(kNotifyQAlert, EnsureInternal(kAppName),
   EnsureInternal(kUnsupportedScreenSize));
AddDeferredAction(closeMeFunc, [self]);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>UNDOCUMENTED FEATURES OF DATA TYPES</b>
</p>
<p>
Rely only on the features and details of built-in data types that are documented. There<br>
are three common problem areas: order of slots in a frame, precision of integers, and<br>
implementation of strings.
</p>
<p>
The order of slots in a frame is undefined. It just so happens that in the current<br>
implementation the first 20 slots are returned in the order added. This is not a<br>
documented feature, so don't rely on it.
</p>
<p>
Integers are documented as having at least 30 bits of precision. This doesn't mean<br>
they'll always be 30 bits; they could be wider (as anyone who has used compiled<br>
NewtonScript can tell you). Note that compiled NewtonScript integers may not be 32<br>
bits; they also follow the "at least 30 bits" rule.
</p>
<p>
The biggest offender is assumptions about how strings are implemented. Don't rely on<br>
strings being null terminated or being composed of two-byte Unicode characters. The<br>
practical upshot is that you should use StrLen to find the length, and StrMunger (or<br>
&amp;) for length changes. Don't use Length, SetLength, or BinaryMunger with strings.<br>
Don't use the array accessor to set a string; you can check a character, but don't set a<br>
character.
</p>
<p>
<b>MISCELLANEOUS BITS</b>
</p>
<p>
Don't send messages directly to the IOBox; use the kSendFunc platform file function.<br>
Nor should you read the items in the IOBox soups.
</p>
<p>
Also note that there are platform file functions to register and unregister for Find that<br>
you should use.
</p>
<p>
Always use SetValue when you're changing the view or other system values.
</p>
<p>
Use only the <b>body</b> slot in items that you route. Don't assume that slots other than <b>body</b><br>
will survive the routing process. On a related note, don't rely on the <b>category</b> slot of<br>
<b>fields</b> in your SetupRoutingSlip method either.
</p>
<p>
Don't rely on the closing order of views in the viewQuitScript. If you need to do some<br>
ordered cleanup, you can initiate your own message (for example, myViewQuitScript)<br>
from the view that first receives the viewQuitScript.
</p>
<p>
Replace system functions and messages at your peril. It's possible they will support<br>
other data types in the future (for example, to take NIL now where before they only<br>
took a string).
</p>
<p>
Don't assume anything about the built-in applications. Don't assume that they exist, or<br>
that their soups are there, or that the view structure will stay the same. If you do need<br>
to use a system feature (for example, a particular prototype, global function, or root<br>
method), test your assumptions.
</p>
<pre>local cardFileExists := GetRoot().cardfile;

if cardFileExists then
begin
   local cardFileSoup := GetUnionSoup(ROM_cardfilesoupname);
   if cardFileSoup then
      ...
end;
// :-0
if GetRoot().keyboardChicken then
begin
   ...
end;</pre>

<p>
Current Newtons have two levels of Undo; this may change. There could be more or<br>
fewer levels and it could change to Undo/Redo. It's safest to call AddUndoAction from<br>
inside your undo action; this will support Undo/Redo if we implement it, but will do<br>
nothing if we do not.
