<b>MORE ON HIDING DIALOG ITEMS</b><br>
In <i>develop </i> Issue 20, I came across the Q&amp;A (at the bottom of page 107) that<br>
recommends using AppendDITL and ShortenDITL to add or remove many dialog items at<br>
once rather than using ShowDItem and HideDItem on each item individually. I agree<br>
with what's said; however, there's an issue with using AppendDITL that I encountered<br>
recently and confirmed with Developer Support.<br>
<p>
I've been involved in writing an application that uses 'ictb' resources to define the font<br>
for each dialog item. This is necessary for our application to&nbsp;&nbsp;allow globalization. When<br>
AppendDITL is called to append items to the dialog, the associated 'ictb' resource for the<br>
appended DITL resource isn't loaded. 'ictb' resources are loaded only when NewDialog is<br>
called. As a result, AppendDITL can't be used in this case; the show/hide items<br>
mechanism must be used instead.

I find <i>develop </i> informative; keep up the good work.<br>

<b>PUZZLE PAGE ERROR: OPENRF</b><br>
The solution for the Puzzle Page in <i> develop </i> Issue 20 is wrong. It says that&nbsp;&nbsp;the Finder<br>
should use OpenRF instead of OpenResFile. OpenRF allows the resource fork to be<br>
accessed only as a data stream, and so is useful only if the code wants to copy the entire<br>
resource fork without examining its contents. To look at bundles and icons and such, a<br>
routine such as HOpenResFile must be used -- which is, in fact, what the Finder calls.
</p>
<p>
The cause of the bug isn't that the Finder uses fsRdWrPerm, but that it uses<br>
fsCurPerm. <i> Inside Macintosh: More Macintosh Toolbox </i> implies that fsCurPerm will<br>
work fine if the file is open for writing by someone else, and that read permission to<br>
the file will be granted in that case. But unfortunately, fsCurPerm will fail, just like<br>
fsRdWrPerm, if the file is already open for writing. To guarantee access to the<br>
resource fork of the file, fsRdPerm must be used instead of fsCurPerm. This change<br>
was made to the Finder in system software version 7.5.1.
</p>
<p>
Still, you can't blame Shelley and Byron for getting the wrong answer; they're just<br>
dogs, and most dogs don't have access to Finder sources.<br>
-- Greg Anderson, Apple Computer
</p>
<p>
<i>I conferred with my dogs and they apologized profusely for assuming the inner</i><br>
<i>workings of the Finder that they indeed did not understand. Thanks for the correction.</i><br>

<b>PUZZLE PAGE STINKS</b><br>
Has it ever occurred to you how small must be the audience to which your regular<br>
contributors KON &amp; BAL are playing? Their Puzzle Page is elitist and intellectually<br>
arrogant. Who do you imagine would be privy to the Apple-Eyes-Only knowledge<br>
necessary to solve some of these puzzles? As you progress further and further into<br>
their morass of micro-minutiae, they indicate that you're less and less clever due to<br>
your ever-reducing "score." The whole concept is punitive, pedantic,&nbsp;&nbsp;and boorish. And<br>
those invectives at&nbsp;&nbsp;the end of the article continue the process of belittling the reader<br>
with the suggestion that, due to your incredibly low score, "Maybe you'd better stick to<br>
AppleScript." Ouch! As it happens, AppleScript is an incredibly powerful technology<br>
that helps to differentiate the Mac OS from being just another pretty interface. Their<br>
attempt at being humorous isn't lost on me, but it failed nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
Those guys are certainly smart and Apple needs to have people like that on the&nbsp;&nbsp;payroll.<br>
But the average fellow in Kansas with a subscription to <i> develop </i> who has adopted Apple<br>
as his computing beacon is mocked by such articles and to no real good end. The Puzzle<br>
Page is wasted on all but the most inner circle of monks in&nbsp;&nbsp;the Apple sanctum<br>
sanctorum.<br>
-- Lance Drake

<p>
<i>Your letter was surprising, since we get a lot of good feedback on the Puzzle Page. The</i><br>
<i>puzzle format is just for fun (heh heh). The idea is that you learn something from the</i><br>
<i>debugging techniques. Probably no one ever scores above 0, but that's not really the</i><br>
<i>point. If you haven't already, you might want to take a look at the two letters in Issue</i><br>
<i>20 on the subject of the Puzzle Page.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Humor is a tricky thing: what some people find hilarious, others find repugnant. I'm</i><br>
<i>sorry the Puzzle Page doesn't work for you. I certainly don't want any of our readers to</i><br>
<i>feel mocked; maybe our publishing this letter will stimulate some dialog on this.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Regarding your specific comment about AppleScript: we couldn't agree more. We hope</i><br>
<i>you'll be pleased with our new regular column, According to Script.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>By the way, Apple does indeed need smart people like KON &amp; BAL on the payroll, but</i><br>
<i>they don't work for Apple anymore.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for writing.</i><br>

<b>UNTIDY CODE (GIVE US A BREAK)</b><br>
Greg Anderson's article in Issue 20 of <i> develop</i> , in the listing on page 67, gave me a<br>
probably unintentional insight into the deeper workings of Apple code. Apparently,<br>
constructions like this
</p>
<pre>while (true) {
    do something
    if (somethingelse) break;
}</pre>
<p>
are acceptable at Apple nowadays. Surely there must be a better, less sloppy and lazy<br>
way to do this. (Please don't ask me what's wrong with it; that would force me to go and<br>
buy Windoze machines next.)<br>
-- Joost Carpay
</p>
<p>
<i>You're right; the use of a </i><b><i> break </i></b><i>statement in conjunction with </i><b><i> while (true)</i></b><i> is</i><br>
<i>generally considered poor style. Good style would be:</i>
</p>
<pre>condition = true;
while (condition)
    condition = DoSomething();</pre>
<p>
<i>While code that appears in </i> develop <i>should of course use good style, the </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;develop <i>staff</i><br>
<i>tells me that they are loath to enforce particular rules; they can, however, make</i><br>
<i>suggestions, and will keep an eye out for this construct in the future. Apple's</i><br>
<i>guidelines for software development recommend against using breaks inside loops and</i><br>
<i>also against using </i><b><i> do</i></b><i>/</i><b><i>while</i></b><i> in place of a simple </i><b><i> while </i></b><i>loop.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The ultimate metric used to judge code should be the clarity of the intent of the</i><br>
<i>algorithm in question. Using good and consistent style certainly improves the</i><br>
<i>readability of code, but I would hope that small infractions of style would be forgiven</i><br>
<i>if the intent of the code remains clear. Code quality is important to Apple, and we're</i><br>
<i>always working at improving the process used to produce system software.</i><br>
<i>-- Greg Anderson</i>

WHAT DO<b><i> YOU</i></b> THINK OF THE PUZZLE PAGE or the rest of <i>develop</i> , for that matter?<br>
We welcome timely letters to the editors, especially regarding articles published in<br>
<i>develop</i> . Letters should be addressed to Caroline Rose -- or, if technical <i>develop</i><br>
-related questions, to Dave Johnson -- at AppleLink CROSE or JOHNSON.DK. Or you<br>
can write to Caroline or Dave at Apple Computer, Inc., 1 Infinite Loop, M/S 303-4DP,<br>
Cupertino, CA 95014. All letters should include your name and company name as well<br>
as your address and phone number. Letters may be excerpted or edited for clarity (or<br>
to make them say what we wish they did). *
