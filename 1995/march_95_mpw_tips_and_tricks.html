<h2>MPW TIPS AND TRICKS</h2>
<h2>Launching MPW Faster Than a Speeding Turtle</h2>
<h1>TIM MARONEY</h1>

</p>
<p>
One myth about MPW is that it's slow, but that's an unfair description. Personally, I<br>
think "glacial" would be a more appropriate word, or perhaps "executionally<br>
challenged." However, it's possible to speed it up in a variety of ways, such as<br>
simulating the 68020 instruction set on a fully loaded Cray. On a tighter budget, you<br>
can improve MPW's launch time just by making some minor changes to your<br>
configuration. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps some of you are asking, "Who cares about launch time? Compile speed is the<br>
important thing! God built the whole world in less time than it takes me to compile my<br>
project with PPCC, and he only had a slide rule!" It's a valid objection, and I'm glad<br>
you brought it up, but many people launch MPW more often than they compile. Quite a<br>
few projects use MPW as a development workhorse because of its scripting and source<br>
control capabilities, but compile and link using language systems that aren't laboring<br>
under the delusion that they're getting paid by the hour. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;I didn't invent this technique,</b> but I've tuned it up and eliminated some trouble<br>
spots. The original was distributed on&nbsp;&nbsp;a Developer CD so old that I can't find it now. *
</p>
<p>
<b>STATES' RITES</b><br>
The trick is simple and capitalizes on an important fact about MPW tools. Because of<br>
the innovative approach MPW takes to the traditional TTY interface, it's easy to<br>
execute the output of tools by selecting the output with the mouse and pressing the<br>
Enter key. Tool writers are strongly encouraged to write executable commands as their<br>
output. Since some of the tool writers didn't get the message, there are umpty-million<br>
exceptions, but when the tool does the right thing it's very useful. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;There's an even better way</b> to select the output, which is to press Command-Z<br>
twice after running the tool, but don't say I told you so. On the Macintosh, Undo<br>
followed by Redo is supposed to return you to your original state. *
</p>
<p>
The nice people responsible for the Set, Export, Alias, AddMenu, SetKey, CheckOutDir,<br>
and MountProject commands followed MPW policy and made them reversible: giving<br>
these commands without parameters dumps a list of commands that you can execute<br>
later to return to your current state. 
</p>
<p>
As it happens, in a standard MPW configuration there's not much to your state beyond<br>
the output of these seven commands. You're in a current directory and some file<br>
windows might be open, and that's about all that matters. You can save the directory<br>
and the open files with four lines of script. 
</p>
<p>
You can probably see where all this is leading. MPW lets you install scripts that get<br>
run when it quits and when it starts up. Is it really faster to save your state when you<br>
quit and restore it on your next launch than it is to iterate over your startup files?<br>
The answer is an emphatic yes, at least with the usual baroque MPW configuration.<br>
You'll see much less improvement if you're already using a lightweight MPW without<br>
many startup files. 
</p>
<p>
Now if you're clever, you've probably written all kinds of things that need to get loaded<br>
each time you start up. I can understand that -- I often feel like I need to get loaded<br>
every time I launch the MPW Shell myself! Maybe you've written a tool that lets you<br>
add hierarchical menus to the MPW Shell so that you can keep your wrist muscles<br>
toned, or a floating utility window with buttons for your frequently used commands.<br>
These clever hacks are going to hurt your startup time, but if&nbsp;&nbsp;you<i> must</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;do something<br>
every time you start up the Shell, you can move these commands into separate files<br>
that still get executed on each launch. 
</p>
<p>
<b>THAT DOES IT - I QUIT!</b><br>
Saving the state is the easiest part of the trick. Just put a file named Quit in your MPW<br>
folder. You can overwrite the default Quit script if you have one, but if you need to<br>
keep it, you can name this script Quit*SaveState instead; the default Quit script will<br>
run it, as well as any other scripts named Quit*Whatever. The script should read like<br>
this, more or less:
</p>
<pre># Quit and save state for fast startup

# We need to set Exit to 0 so that errors won't
# cause Quit or Startup to bomb, but we also want
# to maintain the user's setting of the Exit
# variable. Save and restore it.
Set SaveExit {Exit}
Export SaveExit
Set Exit 0

# State saving is turned off by creating a file
# named DontSaveState in the MPW folder.
If "`Exists "{ShellDirectory}"DontSaveState`"
    Delete -i "{ShellDirectory}"DontSaveState &#8706;
        "{ShellDirectory}"MPW.SuspendState &#8706;
        &#8805; Dev:Null
       
Else

    # Write the state to a temporary file.
    Begin

        # Tell the restoration not to bomb.
        Echo Set Exit 0

        # Save the custom menus.
        AddMenu

        # Save the current directory.
        Echo Directory "`Directory`"
       
        # Save the open windows.
        Echo For window In "`Windows`"
        Echo '  Open "{window}" || Set Status 0'
        Echo 'End &#8805; Dev:Null'
   
        # Save the aliases.
        Alias

        # Save the variables.
        Set

        # Save the exports. This runs much faster
        # with all the exports on one line, so we
        # use -s to get all the names at once.
        Echo Export "`Export -s`"
               
        # Save the key assignments.
        SetKey
        # Save lines that will execute the UserMount
        # script if any. The script doesn't have to
        # exist, and it's harmless to throw it away
        # between saving and restoring state.
        If "`Exists "{ShellDirectory}"UserMount`"
            Echo Execute &#8706;
                "{ShellDirectory}"UserMount &#8706;
                "&#8805; Dev:Null"
        End

        # Save the mounted Projector databases and
        # their checkout directories.
        MountProject
        CheckOutDir -r

        # After the rest of the state is restored
        # with Exit set to 0 to prevent bombing,
        # save lines to restore the user's setting
        # of Exit.
        Echo Set Exit '{SaveExit}'

    End &gt; "{ShellDirectory}"MPW.SuspendState &#8706;
         &#8805; Dev:Null

End

# Sometimes anomalies prevent the Worksheet from
# auto-saving at Quit time; make sure it does.
Save "{Worksheet}"</pre>
<p>
Every time you quit the MPW Shell normally, this Quit script will save your complete<br>
state to a file named MPW.SuspendState in your MPW folder. You probablynoticed that<br>
this can be turned off by creating a file named DontSaveState. You don't have to do this<br>
by hand; if you'll just wait a gosh- darn minute, I'll give you a menu command for it. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the Choose command, which lets you mount a file server, isn't<br>
reversible; that is, it doesn't put out a list of Choose commands that you could run<br>
later to remount your servers. Using this Quit script, though, you can create a file<br>
named UserMount in your MPW folder that will be executed every time you launch,<br>
before any attempt is made to remount your saved projects. This file should contain<br>
Choose commands that mount the servers on which your Projector databases are<br>
located. If you're not using Projector or other remote services, there's no reason to<br>
create this file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's an example, assuming I have a Projector database on the<br>
volume "Rendezvous" on the server "Development" in the zone "Engineering Heck":
</p>
<pre>if !"`Exists Rendezvous:`"
    choose -u 'Tim Maroney' -askpw &#8706;
        "Engineering Heck:Development:Rendezvous"
end</pre>
<p>
The Quit script isn't especially tricky, but if you're new to MPW scripting, you may<br>
be interested to note a few features. 
</p>
<p>
First, observe the use of the back quote ( `), that otherwise useless key at the top left<br>
of your keyboard. MPW uses it the same way as<b>csh</b> (pronounced "sea-shell"), the<br>
seminal UNIX shell from Berkeley: a command inside back quotes is executed and its<br>
output is inserted into the command line containing it. In this case, the Directory,<br>
Windows, and Export commands are backquoted, capturing their output so that it can<br>
be combined with other text using the Echo command. The Exists command is<br>
backquoted so that its output can be treated as a conditional expression. 
</p>
<p>
Another handy fact is that compound statements, like Begin...End blocks, conditionals,<br>
and loops, are treated as single commands that can be redirected in their entirety. This<br>
saves a lot of needless repetition: you don't have to redirect each statement inside the<br>
block. Note the use of the error redirection operator "&gt;=", typed as Option-period.<br>
Like UNIX, MPW Shell has separate output and error channels that can be redirected<br>
independently. In this Quit script, errors are redirected to yet another UNIXism, the<br>
faux file "Dev:Null," which is another way of saying send them to oblivion. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;You can find out more</b> about the various redirection options in MPW by starting<br>
up the MPW Shell and giving the command Help Characters. For clarity, the help text<br>
refers to the error channel as the "diagnostic file specification." *
</p>
<p>
One very important feature of MPW is its set of built-in variables. You can set up any<br>
variables you want by using the Set command, and expand them by putting them in<br>
curly brackets; there are also quite a few built-in variables that tell you things about<br>
the state of the MPW Shell and let you modify its behavior. The ShellDirectory<br>
variable is used extensively in the script; when expanded (<b>"{ShellDirectory}"</b>) it<br>
yields the path name of the folder containing the MPW Shell, where many useful things<br>
are stored. The old name for this variable is "MPW," which you can still use as a<br>
synonym. 
</p>
<p>
Another built-in variable is Exit. If Exit isn't 0, script commands that fail will bring<br>
the execution of their script to a screeching halt; if it is 0, subsequent script<br>
commands will go on regardless of earlier failures, much like some people's<br>
conversational gambits at trade-show parties. These fast-launch scripts set Exit to 0,<br>
because if there's a failure at some point, the rest of the state should still be saved and<br>
restored. In normal MPW setups, Exit is set to 1 most of the time, but since<br>
idiosyncratic MPW configurations set it to 0 as the default, some special work is<br>
needed to save and restore the user's Exit setting. This is done by saving Exit in a<br>
custom variable named SaveExit, which records Exit at the beginning of the Quit script<br>
and restores it at the conclusion of the MPW.SuspendState script. 
</p>
<p>
<b>HAPPINESS IS A WARM BOOT</b><br>
The startup sequence is slightly more complicated. After all, you've got to iterate over<br>
all those startup files sometime. The approach I'm using distinguishes between a cold<br>
boot, which does a pretty normal startup, and a warm boot, which starts up quickly<br>
from MPW.SuspendState. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;"Cold boot" and "warm boot"</b> are terms that old-time programmers will<br>
remember from the manual kick-starters on the original Model T computers.*
</p>
<p>
There's a menu item you can use to force the next launch to be a cold boot, or you can<br>
throw away the MPW.SuspendState file before launching for the same effect. The cold<br>
boot mechanism exists mostly for the sake of paranoia, so programmers tend to use it<br>
frequently. Generally speaking, you don't need to do a cold boot after you change your<br>
startup files; you can just select the change and press Enter. The modifications will get<br>
stored in the saved state the next time you quit. 
</p>
<p>
MPW comes with a file named Startup that gets executed each time the Shell is<br>
launched. Rename Startup to ColdStartup and put the following in a new Startup file:
</p>
<pre># Restore the state if possible; else cold boot.
# &#8721;&#8721; means redirect to end of file.
If "`Exists "{ShellDirectory}MPW.SuspendState"`"
    Execute "{ShellDirectory}MPW.SuspendState"
       &#8721;&#8721; "{Worksheet}"
    Set ColdBoot 0
Else
    Beep 2g,3 2f,3 2a,3     # Hum a merry tune
    Begin
        Echo "MPW.SuspendState was not found."
        Echo "Here's your Cold Boot..."
    End &#8721;&#8721; "{Worksheet}"
    Execute "{ShellDirectory}ColdStartup"
    Set ColdBoot 1
End

Export ColdBoot

# Do anything that needs doing each launch
# (UserStartup*X files in EachBoot folder).
If "`Exists -d "{ShellDirectory}EachBoot"`"
    For fileName in `(Files &#8706;
                "{ShellDirectory}"EachBoot:UserStartup*&#8776; &#8706;
                || Set Status 0) &gt;= Dev:Null`
        Execute "{fileName}"
    End
    Unset fileName
End
Unset ColdBoot</pre>
<p>
The default Startup script runs all the files whose names start with "UserStartup*" in<br>
the MPW folder: UserStartup*Utilities, UserStartup*EraseBootBlocks,<br>
UserStartup*AlterPersonnelRecords, and so forth. You just moved the default Startup<br>
script to ColdStartup, so these files will get reexecuted whenever you do a cold boot.<br>
Also, in case you need to do something every time you launch regardless of whether it's<br>
a cold or a warm boot, you can put it in a UserStartup*Whatever file in a folder named<br>
EachBoot in the MPW folder. 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes you need to do something different at startup depending on whether it's a<br>
cold or a warm boot. The Startup script above sets a variable named ColdBoot so that<br>
you can distinguish between cold and warm startups. In one of your startup scripts,<br>
you can use the ColdBoot variable in a conditional construct. For instance, suppose<br>
you're part of a large project with a centrally maintained MPW configuration that uses<br>
a custom tool named HierMenu to create a hierarchical menu. HierMenu is called from<br>
the central UserStartup*Project script at cold boot, but because it's not a standard<br>
part of MPW, it also needs to get called from an EachBoot script at warm boot -- the<br>
state isn't automatically saved by the Quit script. You don't want to edit the shared file<br>
UserStartup*Project because you'll have to laboriously reapply your change every<br>
time the build engineers improve the central copy, but you can't run HierMenu more<br>
than once without bringing the system to its knees. The solution is to create a<br>
UserStartup*DoHierMenu file in your EachBoot folder which only runs HierMenu in<br>
the case of a warm boot, like so:
</p>
<pre>If &amp;not; "{ColdBoot}"
HierMenu HierItem MainMenu 'Title for Item'
End</pre>
<p>
I promised you a menu command to do a cold boot. Here it is (in the immortal words of<br>
Heidi Fleiss, don't say I never gave you anything). Put this in a file named<br>
UserStartup*ColdBootItem in your MPW folder:
</p>
<pre>AddMenu File '(-' '' # menu separator
AddMenu File "Quit with Cold Boot..." &#8706;
    'confirm "Quit with cold boot?" &amp;&amp; &#8706; (Set Exit 0; &#8706;
    Echo &gt; "{ShellDirectory}"DontSaveState; &#8706;
    Quit)'</pre>
<p>
<b>MEASURING PERFORMANCE WISELY</b><br>
If you measure performance by elapsed time, MPW can be slow. However, real-world<br>
performance has more to do with usefulness than with theoretical throughput. I don't<br>
use my computer to run Dhrystone benchmarks: I use it to accomplish tasks. MPW<br>
gives me the power to accomplish the complex and bizarre tasks of programming<br>
automatically. 
</p>
<p>
Real-world friendliness is always relative to a particular set of users and a particular<br>
set of tasks. The very things that make UNIX and MPW unfriendly to novice users make<br>
them friendly to programmers, who have the unusual skill of memorizing arcane<br>
commands and connecting them in useful ways. Don't get me wrong; MPW is not the<br>
final frontier of development environments. A true next-generation software<br>
authoring system would make command shells and project files seem equally<br>
ridiculous, but command-line interfaces for programmers are a sound approach, at<br>
least for now. And with a little tuning, they can begreatly improved. In future columns<br>
I'll be sharing more tips on making the worksheet a pleasant place to live.
