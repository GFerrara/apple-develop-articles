<i>The Sound Manager is one powerful multimedia tool for the Macintosh, but no one has</i><br>
<i>ever accused it of being too obvious. This article explores some of the more subtle</i><br>
<i>Sound Manager features, showing some simple ways to improve your application's use</i><br>
<i>of sound. A sample application demonstrates features such as volume overdrive and</i><br>
<i>easy continuous sound.</i>
</p>
<p>
The Sound Manager has a long and distinguished career on the Macintosh. First released<br>
in 1987, it was completely revised in 1993 with the release of Sound Manager 3.0.<br>
The introduction of Sound Manager 3.1 in the summer of 1995 brought native<br>
PowerPC performance, making the Sound Manager one of the most powerful<br>
multimedia tools around. However, getting the most out of the Sound Manager often<br>
means wading through many pages of <i>Inside Macintosh: Sound</i>.
</p>
<p>
This article pulls together valuable information about the Sound Manager, focusing on<br>
some of its little-known features that will ease your development of multimedia<br>
applications. The tips and techniques come straight from the Sound Manager<br>
development team at Apple and cover diverse areas of developer interest, including
</p>
<ul>
<li>parsing sound resources</li>
<li>displaying compression names</li>
<li>maximizing performance</li>
<li>adjusting volume</li>
<li>controlling pitch</li>
<li>playing continuous sounds</li>
<li>compressing audio</li>
</ul>
<p>
Two of these topics, controlling pitch and compressing audio, require the use of Sound<br>
Manager 3.1, which is included on this issue's CD. You'll also find the SoundSecrets<br>
application and its source code on the CD. SoundSecrets demonstrates many of the<br>
techniques described in the article. To get the most out of this article, you should be<br>
familiar with the Sound Manager command interface and concepts such as sound<br>
channels, as described in <i>Inside Macintosh: Sound</i>.
</p>
<p>
So, let's get started unlocking some of those sound secrets!
</p>
<h2>FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR</h2>
<p>
On the Macintosh, sounds can be stored in a variety of formats, including 'snd '<br>
resources, AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) files, and QuickTime movies.<br>
Applications often need to read these files directly and extract their sound data, which<br>
can be a daunting task, especially when you begin to deal with some of the new<br>
compressed sound formats introduced in Sound Manager 3.1 -- for example, IMA 4:1.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, Sound Manager 3.0 introduced a couple of routines to help you navigate<br>
these tricky waters -- GetSoundHeaderOffset and GetCompressionInfo. Let's take a look<br>
at these routines, and put them to work with an example of parsing an 'snd ' resource<br>
taken from the SoundSecrets application.
</p>
<p>
The 'snd ' resource format is described fully in <i>Inside Macintosh: Sound</i>, so we won't go<br>
into detail here, except to say that embedded in the resource is a sound header and the<br>
audio samples themselves. Finding this embedded sound header is the job of<br>
GetSoundHeaderOffset. It takes a handle to an arbitrary 'snd ' resource and returns the<br>
offset of the sound header data structure within that handle.
</p>
<p>
However, once you find the sound header, your work is not complete; you must<br>
determine which of the three possible sound header structures it is. In the<br>
SoundSecrets application, the sound header is represented as a union of the three<br>
structures SoundHeader, ExtSoundHeader, and CmpSoundHeader. The <b>encode</b>field in<br>
these structures determines which union member to use when examining the header.
</p>
<p>
After you've extracted the appropriate information from the sound header, you can use<br>
the GetCompressionInfo routine to determine the sound format and the compression<br>
settings. GetCompressionInfo fills out and returns a CompressionInfo record, which<br>
contains the OSType format of the sound, samples per packet, bytes per packet, and<br>
bytes per sample. You can use these fields to convert between samples, frames, and<br>
bytes.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>For a thorough discussion</b><b>of GetCompressionInfo</b>, see the Macintosh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical Note "GetCompressionInfo()" (SD 1).*
</p>
<p>
As shown in Listing 1, the SoundSecrets application uses GetSoundHeaderOffset to find<br>
the sound header structure, and then uses a <b>case</b> statement based on the<b>encode</b> field to<br>
extract the useful information from each type of header. The SoundSecrets application<br>
calculates the number of samples in the sound using information returned by<br>
GetCompressionInfo.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1. </b>Getting information from the sound header
</p>
<pre>typedef union {
   SoundHeader         s;         // Plain sound header
   CmpSoundHeader      c;         // Compressed sound header
   ExtSoundHeader      e;         // Extended sound header
} CommonSoundHeader, *CommonSoundHeaderPtr;

OSErr ParseSnd(Handle sndH, SoundComponentData *sndInfo,
      CompressionInfo *compInfo, unsigned long *headerOffsetResult,
      unsigned long *dataOffsetResult)
{
   CommonSoundHeaderPtr      sh;
   unsigned long            headerOffset, dataOffset;
   short                     compressionID;
   OSErr                     err;

   // Use GetSoundHeaderOffset to find the offset of the sound header
   // from the beginning of the sound resource handle.
   err = GetSoundHeaderOffset((SndListHandle) sndH,
         (long *) &amp;headerOffset);
   if (err != noErr)
      return (err);
  
   // Get pointer to the sound header using this offset.
   sh = (CommonSoundHeaderPtr) (*sndH + headerOffset);
   dataOffset = headerOffset;

   // Extract the sound information based on encode type.
   switch (sh-&gt;s.encode) {
      case stdSH:      // Standard sound header
         sndInfo-&gt;sampleCount = sh-&gt;s.length;
         sndInfo-&gt;sampleRate = sh-&gt;s.sampleRate;
         sndInfo-&gt;sampleSize = 8;
         sndInfo-&gt;numChannels = 1;
         dataOffset += offsetof(SoundHeader, sampleArea);
         compressionID = notCompressed;
         break;

      case extSH:    // Extended sound header
         sndInfo-&gt;sampleCount = sh-&gt;e.numFrames;
         sndInfo-&gt;sampleRate = sh-&gt;e.sampleRate;
         sndInfo-&gt;sampleSize = sh-&gt;e.sampleSize;
         sndInfo-&gt;numChannels = sh-&gt;e.numChannels;
         dataOffset += offsetof(ExtSoundHeader, sampleArea);
         compressionID = notCompressed;
         break;

      case cmpSH:      // Compressed sound header
         sndInfo-&gt;sampleCount = sh-&gt;c.numFrames;
         sndInfo-&gt;sampleRate = sh-&gt;c.sampleRate;
         sndInfo-&gt;sampleSize = sh-&gt;c.sampleSize;
         sndInfo-&gt;numChannels = sh-&gt;c.numChannels;
         dataOffset += offsetof(CmpSoundHeader, sampleArea);
         compressionID = sh-&gt;c.compressionID;


          sndInfo-&gt;format = sh-&gt;c.format;

         break;

      default:
         return (badFormat);
         break;
   }

   // Use GetCompressionInfo to get the data format of the sound and
   // the compression information.
   compInfo-&gt;recordSize = sizeof(CompressionInfo);
   err = GetCompressionInfo(compressionID, sndInfo-&gt;format,
         sndInfo-&gt;numChannels, sndInfo-&gt;sampleSize, compInfo);
   if (err != noErr)
      return (err);

   // Store the sound data format and convert frames to samples.
   sndInfo-&gt;format = compInfo-&gt;format;
   sndInfo-&gt;sampleCount *= compInfo-&gt;samplesPerPacket;

   // Return offset of header and audio data.
   *headerOffsetResult = headerOffset;
   *dataOffsetResult = dataOffset;

   return (noErr);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CHOOSE THE RIGHT NAME</h2>
<p>
Now that you've extracted the sound settings from an 'snd ' resource, the next thing<br>
you'll want to do is display this information to the user of your application. Settings<br>
like sample rate and sample size are easy to display, but what if the sound is<br>
compressed? All you've got is an OSType to describe the compressed sound data format,<br>
and not too many users are going to get much out of seeing something like 'MAC3'<br>
displayed on their screen.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, the Sound Manager makes it easy for you to find a string to display that<br>
does make sense. Using the Component Manager, you can look up the name of the audio<br>
codec used to expand the compressed sound, and use this name to describe the<br>
compression format to the user.
</p>
<p>
This is done with the Component Manager routine FindNextComponent, which is passed<br>
a ComponentDescription record. By setting the componentType field of this record to<br>
kSoundDecompressor, the componentSubType field to the OSType of the compressed<br>
sound data format, and the remaining fields to 0, you can search for the sound<br>
component that will decompress the sound. Once you have the component, you can use<br>
GetComponentInfo to obtain the component name, which is the descriptive string that<br>
makes sense to the user. The routine from SoundSecrets shown in Listing 2 finds the<br>
name of any compressed sound format.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 2. </b>Finding the name of a compressed sound format
</p>
<pre>OSErr GetCompressionName(OSType compressionType,
           Str255 compressionName)
{
   ComponentDescription      cd;
   Component               component;
   Handle                  componentName;
   OSErr                     err;

   // Look for decompressor component.
   cd.componentType = kSoundDecompressor;
   cd.componentSubType = compressionType;
   cd.componentManufacturer = 0;
   cd.componentFlags = 0;
   cd.componentFlagsMask = 0;

   component = FindNextComponent(nil, &amp;cd);
   if (component == nil) {
      err = siInvalidCompression;
      goto FindComponentFailed;
   }

   // Create handle for name.
   componentName = NewHandle(0);     
   if (componentName == nil) {
      err = MemError();
      goto NewNameFailed;
   }

   // Get name from the Component Manager.
   err = GetComponentInfo(component, &amp;cd, componentName, nil, nil);
   if (err != noErr)
      goto GetInfoFailed;

   // Return name.
   BlockMoveData(*componentName, compressionName,
         GetHandleSize(componentName));

GetInfoFailed:
   DisposeHandle(componentName);
NewNameFailed:
FindComponentFailed:
   return (err);
}</pre>

<h2>MAXIMIZE YOUR POTENTIAL</h2>
<p>
The Sound Manager is almost always used in conjunction with other operations on the<br>
Macintosh. For example, QuickTime uses the Sound Manager to play a sound track<br>
while it's drawing the frames of a movie, and games play sound effects and background<br>
music while animating the screen. That's why the performance of the Sound Manager is<br>
of such great concern to many programmers: if the Sound Manager takes too much time<br>
to do its work, QuickTime will begin to drop video frames and games or animations will<br>
run slower.
</p>
<p>
To get the best performance out of the Sound Manager, you first need to understand a<br>
little about how it plays a sound. The Sound Manager's major function is to convert the<br>
sounds played by an application into the audio format required by the sound hardware<br>
on a particular computer. For example, the sound hardware on the Power Macintosh<br>
8100 requires a stream of 16-bit, stereo, 44.1 kHz audio samples, so the Sound<br>
Manager must convert all sounds to this format during playback.
</p>
<p>
It does this by examining the format of the sound to be played, and setting up the<br>
proper conversion steps needed to convert it to the hardware format. These steps might<br>
include decompression, sample size adjustment, sample rate conversion, volume<br>
adjustment, and mixing, all of which take time away from your application.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the best way to maximize Sound Manager performance is to simply supply<br>
it with sounds that are already in the format required by the sound hardware. This<br>
way, the Sound Manager doesn't have to spend a lot of time processing, and your<br>
application will have more time to do other operations. Fortunately, Sound Manager<br>
3.1 provides a new routine, SndGetInfo, that helps you determine the current sound<br>
hardware settings, so maximizing performance is a snap. (Of course, this technique<br>
applies only to sounds the application generates itself, since otherwise you have no<br>
control over their format.)
</p>
<p>
SndGetInfo is a selector-based routine that returns information about the sound<br>
channel. You pass in an OSType selector, and it returns a data structure of information.<br>
(This is similar to the operation of the SPBGetDeviceInfo routine in the Sound Input<br>
Manager, and in fact they use the same selectors.) Once you know the sound hardware<br>
sample rate, sample size, and number of channels, you know the kind of sounds that<br>
will be played back most efficiently.
</p>
<p>
The SoundSecrets application demonstrates how to determine the hardware settings and<br>
then find the sound with the correct format. It uses the GetHardwareSettings routine,<br>
which determines the hardware settings, and the FindMatchingSound routine, which<br>
chooses the right sound to play to maximize performance.
</p>
<p>
Listing 3 shows how to use SndGetInfo to return the current hardware settings.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 3. </b>Getting the current hardware settings
</p>
<pre>OSErr GetHardwareSettings(SndChannelPtr chan,
      SoundComponentData *hardwareInfo)
{
   OSErr   err;

   err = SndGetInfo(chan, siNumberChannels,
                    &amp;hardwareInfo-&gt;numChannels);
   if (err != noErr)
      return (err);

   err = SndGetInfo(chan, siSampleRate,
                    &amp;hardwareInfo-&gt;sampleRate);
   if (err != noErr)
      return (err);

   err = SndGetInfo(chan, siSampleSize, &amp;hardwareInfo-&gt;sampleSize);
   if (err != noErr)
      return (err);

   if (hardwareInfo-&gt;sampleSize == 8)
      hardwareInfo-&gt;format = kOffsetBinary;
   else
      hardwareInfo-&gt;format = kTwosComplement;

   return (noErr);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>PUMP UP THE VOLUME</h2>
<p>
Most sound programmers have heard (literally) about the venerable ampCmd<br>
command, which lets you scale the volume of all sounds on a channel from a minimum<br>
of 0 (silence) to 255 (full volume). However, only the truly righteous know that<br>
Sound Manager 3.0 added an even more powerful command for manipulating sound<br>
volume -- volumeCmd.
</p>
<p>
The volumeCmd command does three things. First, like ampCmd, it allows you to scale<br>
the volume from silence to full volume. However, volumeCmd doesn't stop there; like<br>
that revolutionary amplifier in the movie <i>Spinal Tap</i> that could go all the way to 11, it<br>
lets you go beyond full volume to overdrive the sound volume. And finally, it allows<br>
you to control the volume of the left and right channels independently, providing<br>
complete stereo control over your sounds.
</p>
<p>
All this is possible because the volumeCmd command represents the sound volume in<br>
16-bit fixed-point notation. By using the most significant 8 bits to represent the<br>
integer portion of the volume and the least significant 8 bits for the fractional portion,<br>
it provides very precise volume settings. And overdriving the sound is a cinch. By<br>
combining the left and right volume settings into one 32-bit quantity, volumeCmd<br>
gives you full control over how loud you can blast your speakers. Another command,<br>
getVolumeCmd, returns the current volume setting, in case you forgot what you set it<br>
to.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A new interaction</b><b>between the volumeCmd and ampCmd</b> commands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was added in Sound Manager 3.1. Previously, ampCmd would clobber the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;separate left and right settings made by volumeCmd, setting them to the same<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value. Starting with Sound Manager 3.1, volumeCmd now specifies a base<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;volume for a channel, and ampCmd scales against that base, which lets ampCmd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and volumeCmd coexist better when playing the system alert beep.*
</p>
<p>
Table 1 gives some examples of values you can pass to volumeCmd and their effect.<br>
Remember, once you've changed the volume setting with volumeCmd, the setting is<br>
applied immediately to the current sound that's playing (if any) and to every<br>
subsequent sound played on that channel.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/258.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
The SoundSecrets sample program included on the CD demonstrates the usefulness of<br>
volumeCmd by providing a slider control to adjust left and right volume separately,<br>
with volume overdrive up to two times the normal full volume.
</p>
<h2>ACHIEVE PERFECT PITCH</h2>
<p>
One of the trickiest things to do with the Sound Manager is to play a sound at just the<br>
right pitch. While the frequencyCmd command lets you trigger a sound at a given MIDI<br>
note value, and the rateCmd command gives you limited control over the pitch of the<br>
sound currently playing, before Sound Manager 3.1 there was no good way to just play<br>
a sound at an arbitrary pitch, short of generating the samples yourself. So Sound<br>
Manager 3.1 introduced the rateMultiplierCmd command, which gives you perfect<br>
pitch every time.
</p>
<p>
The concept behind rateMultiplierCmd is very simple. Using a Fixed value, you can<br>
apply a multiplier to the playback rate of all sounds played on a channel. This allows<br>
you to vary the sample rate of the sound being played, and thus control its pitch. (Of<br>
course, changing the rate also changes the duration of the sound.) You can use<br>
getRateMultiplierCmd to return the current rate multiplier setting.
</p>
<p>
Like any great concept, it's most easily understood with an example, so Table 2 gives<br>
some values you can pass to rateMultiplierCmd and their effect. Remember, as with<br>
volumeCmd, once you change the rate multiplier with this command, the setting is<br>
applied immediately to the current sound that's playing (if any) and to every<br>
subsequent sound played on that channel. Our helpful SoundSecrets application<br>
demonstrates the rateMultiplierCmd command with a slider control to adjust the<br>
playback rate of the sound from 0.0 to 2.0.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2>PLAYING SOUND THE QUICKTIME WAY</h2>
<p>
Something that vexes nearly everyone using the Sound Manager is attempting to play<br>
continuous sound. Many applications break sounds up into chunks as they're read off<br>
the disk, and most games have background music that's continuously generated and<br>
mixed with sound effects. After spelunking through <i>Inside Macintosh: Sound,</i> you'll<br>
eventually come across the SndPlayDoubleBuffer routine, which looks like the answer<br>
to your prayers. However, SndPlayDoubleBuffer has some serious limitations that you<br>
need to consider.
</p>
<p>
First of all, SndPlayDoubleBuffer ping-pongs between just two buffers, and the<br>
location of those buffers can't be changed once the sound is started, which can be really<br>
inconvenient when you're trying to piece together a lot of sound buffers off the disk. In<br>
addition, the format of the sound being played can't be changed once the sound is<br>
started, and the headers describing the sound must be attached to the sound data itself.
</p>
<p>
There has got be a better way, right? Well, QuickTime uses a strategy involving sound<br>
callbacks that's much more flexible and doesn't make you scratch your head over when<br>
to use that lastBuffer flag in SndPlayDoubleBuffer. Once you read about the QuickTime<br>
way, you'll probably want to use it too.
</p>
<p>
With the QuickTime strategy you trigger all your sounds with a plain old bufferCmd<br>
command, and set up callBackCmd to call you when that buffer is done playing. This has<br>
two big advantages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Because bufferCmd takes a pointer to a sound header as its only<br>
parameter, you can queue up a different buffer for every callback if you want,<br>
freeing you from that pesky two-buffer limit.</li>
<li>Because the sound header records contain a pointer to the audio<br>
data, you have a lot more flexibility in buffer management, and you can<br>
dynamically adjust the buffer sizes to any values that make sense to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This technique is demonstrated by Listing 4, taken from the SoundSecrets application<br>
on the CD. Basically, the interrupt routine just plays the next buffer and then queues<br>
up a callback, which keeps the sound playing continuously. The application has a slider<br>
that lets you adjust the size of the buffer dynamically.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 4. </b>Playing continuous sound
</p>
<pre>// Issue bufferCmd to play the sound, using SndDoImmediate.
sndCmd.cmd = bufferCmd;
sndCmd.param1 = 0;
sndCmd.param2 = (long) &amp;globals-&gt;sndHeader;

err = SndDoImmediate(globals-&gt;sndChannel, &amp;sndCmd);
if (err != noErr)
   return (err);

// Issue callBackCmd using SndDoCommand so that we get called back
// when the buffer is done playing.
sndCmd.cmd = callBackCmd;
sndCmd.param1 = 0;
sndCmd.param2 = (long) globals;
err = SndDoCommand(globals-&gt;sndChannel, &amp;sndCmd, true);
if (err != noErr)
   return (err);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Remember, callBackCmd calls your application at interrupt time, so it's up to you to<br>
set up your A5 world if you want to use globals. You can't call Toolbox routines like<br>
those in the Memory Manager from within the callback; however, you can call most<br>
Sound Manager routines (see <i>Inside Macintosh: Sound</i> for information on individual<br>
routines). To make things easier, you can pass an application-defined value to the<br>
callback routine in param2 of callBackCmd. Also, to ensure correct queue processing,<br>
it's very important that you use SndDoImmediate to send bufferCmd, and<br>
SndDoCommand to send callBackCmd.
</p>
<h2>COMPRESS WITH THE BEST</h2>
<p>
While Sound Manager 3.0 included an architecture for decompressing arbitrary<br>
sounds (described in the article "Make Your Own Sound Components" in <i>develop</i>Issue<br>
20), no method was provided to compress sounds. However, with the arrival of Sound<br>
Manager 3.1 and QuickTime 2.1, creating compressed sound files became as easy as<br>
opening a movie.
</p>
<p>
The compression technique demonstrated here uses the import/export facility built<br>
into QuickTime. Movie import components allow you to convert other files into<br>
QuickTime movies, while movie export components let you save QuickTime movies in<br>
other formats. QuickTime 2.1 provides an export component that works with Sound<br>
Manager 3.1 to let you save the audio in a QuickTime movie to an AIFF file in any<br>
format you please.
</p>
<p>
QuickTime does this by calling the Sound Manager to mix all the tracks together,<br>
converting them to the sample rate and size you specify, and even compressing the data<br>
with any of the compression algorithms provided by Sound Manager 3.1. The resulting<br>
AIFF file can then be played by any other Sound Manager routine, or converted back<br>
into a movie. The export component provides a dialog to let the user select the sample<br>
rate, sample size, and compression format of the AIFF file, as shown in Figure 1.

Listing 5 demonstrates the process of converting a movie to an AIFF file, displaying the<br>
Sound Export Options dialog to let the user control the conversion process. The<br>
SetMovieProgressProc routine displays a progress dialog while the movie is being<br>
converted. The code is taken from ExportAIFF on this issue's CD.
</p>

   err = OpenMovieFile(inputFile, &amp;fRef, fsRdPerm);

      goto OpenMovieFileFailed;

   err = NewMovieFromFile(&amp;theMovie, fRef, nil, nil, 0, nil);
   if (err != noErr)
      goto NewMovieFromFileFailed;
   SetMovieProgressProc(theMovie, (MovieProgressUPP) -1L, 0);

   err = ConvertMovieToFile(theMovie, nil, outputFile, 'AIFF',
             'sSnd', 0, nil, showUserSettingsDialog, nil);

   DisposeMovie(theMovie);

NewMovieFromFileFailed:
   CloseMovieFile(fRef);
OpenMovieFileFailed:
   return (err);

<h2>SOUNDING OFF</h2>
<p>
Now that this article has revealed some of the best-kept secrets of the Sound Manager,<br>
you can go out and create great applications on your own. Consider all your new skills<br>
-- parsing and displaying sound resources, improving playback performance,<br>
adjusting volume and pitch, playing continuous sounds, and compressing audio. Now<br>
that the Sound Manager is your friend, you can focus on making your applications<br>
insanely great, instead of having the Sound Manager drive you insane!
