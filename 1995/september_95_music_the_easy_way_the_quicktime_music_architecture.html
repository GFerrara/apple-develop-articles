<i>Music has become cheap and plentiful on the Macintosh, and many applications are now</i><br>
<i>making "casual" use of music. With the QuickTime Music Architecture, or QTMA,</i><br>
<i>including music in your application has never been simpler. Its API is straightforward</i><br>
<i>and easy to use, and you don't need intimate knowledge of MIDI protocols or channel and</i><br>
<i>voice numberings. Nor do you need an external MIDI device; QTMA can play music</i><br>
<i>directly out of the Macintosh's built-in speakers. And QTMA is widely available -- it's</i><br>
<i>on every Macintosh that has QuickTime 2.0 (or later) installed.</i>
</p>
<p>
The QuickTime Music Architecture is perfect for adding a little bit of music to your<br>
application. It has a set of well-supported high-level calls for playing musical notes<br>
and sequences, it deals with MIDI protocols so that your application doesn't have to, and<br>
it handles timing for entire tunes. With QTMA, you can specify musical instruments<br>
independent of device, and play music either directly out of built-in speakers or<br>
through a MIDI synthesizer.
</p>
<p>
QTMA first became available with QuickTime 2.0 and offers some new features in<br>
QuickTime 2.1, which should be available through APDA by the time you read this. The<br>
code in this article is written for version 2.1; minor changes will be required for 2.0.<br>
(Before making use of the QuickTime 2.1 features, your code should call Gestalt with<br>
the gestaltQuickTimeVersion selector and check the version number returned.)
</p>
<p>
This article shows how your application can use QTMA to play individual notes,<br>
sequences of notes composed on the fly, or prescored sequences, and how to read input<br>
from external MIDI devices. This issue's CD contains all the sample code and a THINK C<br>
project to build and run it. We'll start with a look at QTMA in relation to other ways of<br>
supporting music on the Macintosh; then we'll get down to business and play some<br>
music with QTMA.
</p>
<h2>QTMA IN CONTEXT -- A LOOK AT MUSIC AND MIDI SUPPORT<br>
ON THE MACINTOSH</h2>
<p>
Support for MIDI and musical applications on the Macintosh platform has a somewhat<br>
checkered history. Developers have been faced with such options as writing their own<br>
serial drivers, using the MIDI Manager, or using third-party operating system<br>
extensions such as the Open Music System (OMS, formerly Opcode MIDI System) and<br>
the Free MIDI System (FMS) from Mark of the Unicorn. None of these are practical for<br>
adding just a little music to your application.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing a serial driver to send MIDI output to an Apple MIDI adapter or to any<br>
third-party MIDI adapter isn't that complicated if you enjoy writing low-level code to<br>
access hardware registers on the SCC serial chip. I say this in all seriousness: that<br>
kind of code really is fun to write! But it's not the best way to do things, because<br>
changes in the OS and hardware can render your work useless. And writing the<br>
low-level serial code for MIDI input has additional complexities, primarily because of<br>
the interrupt timings in many parts of the Mac OS.
</p>
<p>
The MIDI Manager is a slightly better tool to use for MIDI input and output.<br>
Unfortunately, Apple's support for this product has been less than consistent, and the<br>
MIDI Manager itself has some inherent performance limitations, though these are less<br>
critical on faster hardware (68030 processor or better).
</p>
<p>
Both OMS and FMS are quite appropriate for professional music scoring and editing<br>
products. Among the facilities that these extensions provide is a "studio configuration";<br>
this lets the user describe to the system the various MIDI devices attached to the<br>
computer so that different applications can access them.
</p>
<p>
All of these options have drawbacks for making casual use of music: you have to access<br>
an external MIDI device, which most users don't have, and you have to use MIDI<br>
protocols to talk to that device. QTMA frees you from both of these constraints. It also<br>
frees you from needing to know a lot about MIDI itself; if you want to know anyway,<br>
check out the information in "A MIDI Primer."

<p>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A MIDI PRIMER</b>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MIDI, or Musical Instrument Digital Interface, uses a serial protocol and a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;standard 5-pin connector that you'll find on professional electronic music<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gear made after 1985 or so. The connector's relatively large size, about half<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an inch in diameter, was chosen so that it could withstand the rigors of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;road -- in other words, so that even drummers could plug it in.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because MIDI cables can carry signals in only one direction, synthesizers have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;separate connectors for MIDI input and MIDI output. (This differs from modem<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cables, which carry signals in both directions.)
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MIDI is a serial protocol running at 31250 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parity. The command structure for a MIDI stream is simple: each byte is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either a <i>status byte</i> or a <i>data byte.</i>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A status byte establishes a mode for interpreting the data bytes that follow it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high bit is set, and the next three bits indicate the type of status byte. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;low four bits are typically used to specify a <i>MIDI channel. </i>Thus MIDI can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;address up to 16 unique channels, each of which may play a different musical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instrument sound. Later extensions to MIDI let you address more channels<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through the use of escape codes and bank switching.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common status message is the Play Note message, which has a value<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of 0x90 plus the MIDI channel number. Each note is defined by a pitch and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;velocity. The pitch is an integer from 0 to 127, where 60 is musical middle C<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(61 is C sharp, 59 is B, 72 is the C above middle C, and so on). The velocity is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an integer from 0 to 127 that describes how loud to play the note; 64 is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;average loudness, 127 is very loud, 1 is nearly inaudible, and 0 means to stop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;playing the note.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to play a C-major chord on MIDI channel 0, you send the seven bytes 0x90<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0x3C 0x40 0x40 0x40 0x43 0x40 to begin the sound. After a suitable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interval, you send 0x90 0x3C 0x00 0x40 0x00 0x43 0x00 to silence it.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this is exactly the sort of stuff you don't need to know if you use the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QuickTime Music Architecture for your music-playing needs. But you just<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can't know too many useless facts, right?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;______________________________

<h2>QTMA'S BASIC COMPONENTS</h2>
<p>
QTMA is implemented in three easy pieces, as QuickTime components for playing<br>
individual notes, playing tunes (sequences of notes), and driving MIDI devices.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>note allocator component </i>is used to play individual notes. The calling<br>
application can specify which musical instrument sound to use and exactly<br>
which musical synthesizer to play the notes on. The note allocator component<br>
also includes a utility that allows the user to pick the instrument.</li>
<li>The <i>tune player component </i>can accept entire sequences of musical notes<br>
and play them from start to finish, asynchronously, with no further need for<br>
application intervention. This is handy if you'd like to play some infernally<br>
irritating little melody, or perhaps threnody, during each game level of Boom<br>
Three Dee or whenever.</li>
<li>Individual <i>music components </i>act as device drivers for each type of<br>
synthesizer attached to a particular computer. Two music components are<br>
provided with QuickTime 2.0: the software synthesizer component, to play<br>
music out of the built-in speaker, and the General MIDI component, to play<br>
music on a General MIDI device attached to a serial port. QuickTime 2.1<br>
supports a small number of other popular synthesizers as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>PLAYING NOTES WITH THE NOTE ALLOCATOR</h2>
<p>
Playing a few notes with the note allocator component is simple. To play notes that<br>
have a piano-like sound, you need to open up the note allocator component, allocate a<br>
note channel with a request for piano, and play. That's it! If you're feeling like a<br>
particularly well-behaved software engineer, you might dispose of the note channel<br>
and close the note allocator component when you're done. We'll get to the code in a<br>
moment; first we'll look at some important related data structures.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE-RELATED DATA STRUCTURES</b>
</p>
<p>
A note channel is analogous to a sound channel in that you allocate it, issue commands to<br>
it to produce sound, and close it when you're done. To specify details about the note<br>
channel, you use a data structure called a NoteRequest (see Listing 1). The<br>
NoteRequestInfo structure in the NoteRequest is new in QuickTime 2.1; it simply<br>
encapsulates the first few fields of the old NoteRequest structure and splits the first of<br>
those fields into two, <b>flags </b>and<b>reserved </b>(which are decribed in the documentation<br>
accompanying the QuickTime 2.1 release).
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1. </b>Note-related data structures
</p>
<pre>struct NoteRequest {
   NoteRequestInfo   info;      // * in post-QuickTime 2.0 only
   ToneDescription   tone;
};

struct NoteRequestInfo {
   UInt8      flags;
   UInt8      reserved;
   short      polyphony;
   Fixed      typicalPolyphony;
};

struct ToneDescription {
   OSType   synthesizerType;
   Str31      synthesizerName;
   Str31      instrumentName;
   long      instrumentNumber;
   long      gmNumber;
};</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The next two fields specify the probable polyphony that the note channel will be used<br>
for. Polyphony means, literally, many sounds. A polyphony of 5 means that five notes<br>
can be playing simultaneously. The polyphony field enables QTMA to make sure that the<br>
allocated note channel can play all the notes you'll need. The typicalPolyphony field is a<br>
fixed-point number that should be set to the average number of voices the note channel<br>
will play; it may be whole or fractional. Some music components use this field to<br>
adjust the mixing level for a good volume.
</p>
<p>
The ToneDescription structure is used throughout QTMA to specify a musical<br>
instrument sound in a device-independent fashion. This structure's synthesizerType<br>
and synthesizerName fields can request a particular synthesizer to play notes on.<br>
Usually, they're set to 0, meaning "choose the best General MIDI synthesizer." The<br>
gmNumber field indicates the General MIDI (GM) instrument or drum kit sound,<br>
which may be any of 135 such sounds that are supported by many synthesizer<br>
manufacturers. (All these sounds are available on a General MIDI Sound Module.) The<br>
GM instruments are numbered 1 through 128, and the seven drum kits are numbered<br>
16385 and higher. A complete list of instrument and drum kit numbers is provided in<br>
Table 1. For synthesizers that accept sounds outside the GM library, you can use the<br>
instrumentName and instrumentNumber fields to specify some other sound.<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>

<b>THE NOTE-PLAYING CODE</b>
</p>
<p>
The routine in Listing 2 plays notes in a piano-like sound with the note allocator<br>
component. We start by calling OpenDefaultComponent to open up the component. If<br>
this routine returns 0, the component wasn't opened, most likely because QTMA wasn't<br>
present.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 2. </b>Playing notes with the note allocator component
</p>
<pre>void PlaySomeNotes(void)
{
   NoteAllocator      na;
   NoteChannel         nc;
   NoteRequest         nr;
   ComponentResult   thisError;
   long               t, i;

   na = 0;
   nc = 0;

   // * Open up the note allocator.
   na = OpenDefaultComponent(kNoteAllocatorType, 0);
   if (!na)
      goto goHome;

   // * Fill out a NoteRequest using NAStuffToneDescription to help,
   // * and allocate a NoteChannel.
   nr.info.flags = 0;
   nr.info.reserved = 0;
   nr.info.polyphony = 2;      // simultaneous tones
   nr.info.typicalPolyphony = 0x00010000;  // usually just one note
   thisError = NAStuffToneDescription(na, 1, &amp;nr.tone); // 1 is piano
   thisError = NANewNoteChannel(na, &amp;nr, &amp;nc);
   if (thisError || !nc)
      goto goHome;

   // If we've gotten this far, OK to play some musical notes.

   for (i = 60; i &lt;= 84; i++) {
      NAPlayNote(na, nc, i, 80);   // pitch i at velocity 80

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROGER SHEPARD'S MELODY</b>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Listing 2, if you replace the code in the section labeled "Obligatory do-loop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of rising tones" with the following code, you'll receive a secret treat.
</p>
<pre>      i = 0;
      while (!Button()) {
         long   j, v;
         for (j = i % 13; j &lt; 128; j+=13) {
            v = j &lt; 64 ? j * 2 : (127 - j) * 2;
            NAPlayNote(na, nc, j, v);
         }
         Delay(13, &amp;t);
         for (j = i % 13; j &lt; 128; j+=13)
            NAPlayNote(na, nc, j, 0);
         i++;
      }</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This snappy little melody was discovered by psychologist Roger Shepard in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1960s.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;______________________________
</p>
<p>
Next we fill in the NoteRequestInfo and ToneDescription structures, calling the note<br>
allocator's NAStuffToneDescription routine and passing it the GM instrument number<br>
for piano. This routine fills in the gmNumber field and also fills in the other<br>
ToneDescription fields with sensible values, such as the instrument's name in text<br>
form in the instrumentName field. (The routine can be useful for converting a GM<br>
instrument number to its text equivalent.)
</p>
<p>
After allocating the note channel with NANewNoteChannel, we call NAPlayNote to play<br>
each note. Notice the last two parameters to NAPlayNote:
</p>
<pre>ComponentResult NAPlayNote(NoteAllocator na, NoteChannel nc,
   long pitch, long velocity);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The value of the pitch parameter is an integer from 1 to 127, where 60 is middle C,<br>
61 is C sharp, and 59 is C flat, or B. Similarly, 69 is concert A, and is played at a<br>
nominal audio frequency of 440 Hz. The velocity parameter's value is also an integer<br>
from 1 to 127, or 0. A velocity of 1 corresponds to just barely touching the musical<br>
keyboard, and 127 indicates that the key was struck as hard as possible. Different<br>
velocities produce tones of different volumes from the synthesizer. A velocity of 0<br>
means the key was released; the note stops or fades out, as appropriate to the kind of<br>
sound being played. Here we stop the notes after delaying an appropriate amount of<br>
time with a call to the Delay routine.
</p>
<p>
Finally, being well behaved, we dispose of the note channel and close the note allocator<br>
component.
</p>
<p>
<b>LETTING THE USER PICK THE INSTRUMENT</b>
</p>
<p>
Rather than specify the instrument sound itself, your application may want to let the<br>
user pick it. For this purpose, a nifty instrument picker utility is provided in the note<br>
allocator component. The instrument picker dialog, shown in Figure 1, enables users<br>
to choose musical instruments from the available synthesizers and sounds.

<b>Figure 1. The instrument picker dialog</b>
</p>
<p>
The routine in Listing 3 shows one way that your application can use the instrument<br>
picker. It's nearly identical to the code in Listing 2, except that the NAPickInstrument<br>
routine is called right after the call to NAStuffToneDescription. As in Listing 1,<br>
NAStuffToneDescription fills out a ToneDescription record for a particular GM<br>
instrument number; NAPickInstrument then invokes the instrument picker dialog and<br>
alters the passed ToneDescription to whatever instrument the user selects.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 3. </b>Using the instrument picker
</p>
<pre>void PickThenPlaySomeNotes(void)
{
   ...   // * declarations and initialization

   // * Open up the note allocator.
   ...

   // * Fill out a NoteRequest using NAStuffToneDescription to help,
   // * call NAPickInstrument, and allocate a NoteChannel.
   nr.info.flags = 0;
   nr.info.reserved = 0;
   nr.info.polyphony = 2;      // * simultaneous tones
   nr.info.typicalPolyphony = 0x00010000;
   thisError = NAStuffToneDescription(na, 1, &amp;nr.tone); // 1 is piano
   thisError = NAPickInstrument(na, nil, "\pPick An Instrument:",
                     &amp;nr.tone, 0, 0, nil, nil);
   if (thisError)
      goto goHome;
   thisError = NANewNoteChannel(na, &amp;nr, &amp;nc);
   if (thisError || !nc)
      goto goHome;

   // Play some musical notes.
   ...

   // Obligatory do-loop of rising tones
   ...

goHome:
   ...      // Dispose of the NoteChannel and close the component.

<p>
<b>ADDING EXPRESSIVENESS WITH CONTROLLERS</b>
</p>
<p>
There's much more to music than simply playing the right notes at the right times.<br>
Although your code can simulate only a scant fraction of the expressiveness of a<br>
skillfully played acoustic instrument, there are certain things the note allocator<br>
component lets you do that help make your computer-synthesized music sound more<br>
interesting.
</p>
<p>
As we've already seen, the NAPlayNote routine has parameters for specifying pitch and<br>
velocity, the latter determining the volume of the note; changes in these parameter<br>
values can affect the expressiveness of your music. You can also add expressiveness to<br>
whatever notes are being played by using QTMA's controllers. A controller is a<br>
parameter that's set independently of the notes being played, with a call to the<br>
NASetController routine:
</p>
<pre>ComponentResult NASetController(NoteAllocator na, NoteChannel nc,
   long controllerNumber, long controllerValue);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Two simple controllers are the pitch bend controller and the volume controller. The<br>
pitch bend controller alters the frequency of any notes being played. It's like the<br>
whammy-bar on an electric guitar, which tightens or loosens all the strings<br>
simultaneously. The volume controller affects the sound of all notes similarly to the<br>
way key velocity affects the sound of individual notes.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at some source code that uses the pitch bend controller (Listing 4). This<br>
routine plays a major-fifth interval for a half second, "bends" it up by three<br>
semitones, holds it a half second, and then bends it back down to its original pitch.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 4. </b>Using the pitch bend controller
</p>
<pre>void PlaySomeBentNotes(void)
{
   ...   // declarations and initialization

   // Open up the note allocator.
   ...

   // Fill out a NoteRequest using NAStuffToneDescription to help, and
   // allocate a NoteChannel.
   ...

   // If we've gotten this far, OK to play some musical notes. Lovely.
   NAPlayNote(na, nc, 60, 80);   // middle C at velocity 80
   NAPlayNote(na, nc, 67, 60);   // G at velocity 60
   Delay(30, &amp;t);

   // Loop through differing pitch bendings.
   for (i = 0; i &lt;= 0x0300; i+=10) {      // bend 3 semitones
      NASetController(na, nc, kControllerPitchBend, i);
      Delay(1, &amp;t);
   }
   Delay(30, &amp;t);
   for (i = 0x0300; i &gt;= 0; i-=10) {      // bend back to normal
      NASetController(na, nc, kControllerPitchBend, i);
      Delay(1, &amp;t);
   }
   Delay(30, &amp;t);
   NAPlayNote(na, nc, 60, 0);      // middle C off
   NAPlayNote(na, nc, 67, 0);      // G off

goHome:
   ...      // Dispose of the NoteChannel and close the component.
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Most QuickTime controller values are 16-bit signed fixed-point numbers (where the<br>
lower eight bits are fractional) and have a range of 0 to 127, with a default value of 0.<br>
However, the pitch bend controller has a range of -127 to 127, and the volume<br>
controller has a default value of 127, or maximum volume.
</p>
<p>
The pan controller has a slightly different definition from the other controllers. "Pan"<br>
refers to the position of the sound in the stereo field. Most synthesizers have audio<br>
output for left and right; on such synthesizers, the pan value is interpreted as follows:<br>
The default pan position (usually centered) is specified by a value of 0 to the pan<br>
controller. To position the sound arbitrarily, values between 1 (0x0100) and 2<br>
(0x0200) are used to range between left and right, respectively. For synthesizers<br>
with n outputs, values between 1 and n are used to pan between each adjacent pair of<br>
outputs. Note that the built-in synthesizer doesn't currently support panning.
</p>
<h2>BUILDING A TUNE</h2>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, an application can use the tune player component to play entire<br>
sequences of notes, or tunes. Applications often find it useful to play a tune that has<br>
been precomposed and stored in the application; other times, it may be useful to<br>
construct a tune at run time and then play it. In either case, the application must first<br>
build the tune. Here we'll take a look at the format of a tune and the routines and<br>
macros we use for building one.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE FORMAT OF A TUNE</b>
</p>
<p>
The format for tunes is a series of long words, subdivided into bitfields. Your<br>
application needs to build a tune header and tune sequence made up of different types of<br>
"events." The tune header contains one or more note request events, each a NoteRequest<br>
data structure with some encapsulating long words. The tune sequence is made up of<br>
note events that specify notes and durations, controller changes, and so on, as well as<br>
rest events; it's the musical score.
</p>
<p>
In the tune header, each note request event has the structure shown in Figure 2. (It's<br>
actually a general event, of the note request subtype.) Thus the first word is<br>
0xFnnn0017, where nnn is the part number, and the last word is 0xC0010017. The<br>
part number is referred to later on by note events in the tune sequence. For example,<br>
given a header than contains a note request event specifying part 3, subsequent note<br>
events that specify part 3 will play in a note channel allocated according to that<br>
NoteRequest.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/231.gif" width="537 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2. A note request event</b>
</p>
<p>
In the tune sequence, each note event includes the part, pitch, velocity, and duration of<br>
the note; a rest event specifies only a duration (see Figure 3). A note event can have<br>
either a short or an extended format. In a short note event, the pitch is limited to the<br>
range 32 to 95 (which covers most musical notes) and the part number must be less<br>
than 32. If either of these ranges is too small, or if you want to use a fixed-point pitch<br>
value or a very long duration, the extended note format may be used. Much of the time<br>
you can use the short format, to save space.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3. Note and rest events</b>
</p>
<p>
Both headers and sequences end with a marker event containing all zeroes (equivalent<br>
to 0x60000000), shown in Figure 4.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<b>Figure 4. A marker event</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>THE TUNE-BUILDING CODE</b>
</p>
<p>
Our sample code includes routines for building the tune header and tune sequence.<br>
These routines use some handy event-stuffing macros that are defined in the file<br>
QuickTimeComponents.h, and all have the form _StuffSomething(arguments).<br>
BuildTuneHeader (Listing 5) uses the following macro:
</p>
<pre>_StuffGeneralEvent(w1, w2, part, subtype, length);</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The _StuffGeneralEvent macro fills in the head and tail long words of a particular type<br>
of general event -- in our case, a note request event. Its arguments are, in order: the<br>
head and tail long words; the part number; the event subtype<br>
(kGeneralEventNoteRequest for a note request event); and the length in long words of<br>
the entire event, counting the head and tail. Note that the first two arguments are the<br>
head and tail themselves, not pointers -- the macro expands to a direct assignment of<br>
these arguments.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 5. </b>BuildTuneHeader
</p>
<pre>#define kNoteRequestHeaderEventLength \
               (sizeof(NoteRequest) /sizeof(long) + 2)   // long words
#define our_header_length \
   ((2 * kNoteRequestHeaderEventLength + 1)) * sizeof(long)   // bytes
unsigned long *BuildTuneHeader(void)
{
   unsigned long      *header, *w, *w2;
   NoteRequest         *nr;
   NoteAllocator      na;   // just for the NAStuffToneDescription
call
   ComponentResult   thisError;

   header = 0;
   na = 0;

   // Open up the note allocator.
   na = OpenDefaultComponent(kNoteAllocatorType, 0);
   if (!na)
      goto goHome;

   // Allocate space for the tune header, rather inflexibly.
   header = (unsigned long *) NewPtrClear(our_header_length);
   if (!header)
      goto goHome;
   w = header;

   // Stuff request for piano polyphony 4.
   w2 = w + kNoteRequestHeaderEventLength - 1;   // last long word of
                                                // note request event
   _StuffGeneralEvent(*w, *w2, 1, kGeneralEventNoteRequest,

       // 1 is piano
   thisError = NAStuffToneDescription(na, 1, &amp;nr-&gt;tone);
   w += kNoteRequestHeaderEventLength;

   // Stuff request for violin polyphony 3.  
   w2 = w + kNoteRequestHeaderEventLength - 1;   // last long word of
                                                // note request event
   _StuffGeneralEvent(*w, *w2, 2, kGeneralEventNoteRequest,
                           kNoteRequestHeaderEventLength);
   nr = (NoteRequest *)(w + 1);
   nr-&gt;info.flags = 0;
   nr-&gt;info.reserved = 0;
   nr-&gt;info.polyphony = 3;      // simultaneous tones

goHome:
   if (na)
      CloseComponent(na);
   return header;
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
BuildTuneSequence (Listing 6) uses the _StuffNoteEvent and _StuffRestEvent macros.
</p>
<pre>_StuffNoteEvent(w, part, pitch, volume, duration);</pre>
<p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
The _StuffNoteEvent macro fills in a note event. Its arguments are, in order: the long<br>
word to stuff; the part number; the pitch (where, as usual, 60 is middle C); the<br>
volume (velocity); and the duration (usually specified in 600ths of a second). The<br>
pitch must be between 32 and 95, and the part number must be less than 32. For<br>
values outside these ranges, a fixed-point pitch value, or a very long duration, use<br>
_StuffXNoteEvent.
</p>
<pre>_StuffXNoteEvent(w1, w2, part, pitch, volume, duration);</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The _StuffXNoteEvent macro is for extended note events. It's identical to<br>
_StuffNoteEvent except that it provides larger ranges for pitch, part, and duration,<br>
and the event itself takes two long words.
</p>
<pre>_StuffRestEvent(w, restDuration);</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The _StuffRestEvent macro fills in a rest event. It takes two arguments: the long word<br>
to stuff and the duration of the rest.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 6. </b>BuildTuneSequence
</p>
<pre>#define kNoteDuration 240      // in 600ths of a second
#define kRestDuration 300      // in 600ths -- tempo will be 120 bpm

#define our_sequence_length (22 * sizeof(long))      // bytes
#define our_sequence_duration (9 * kRestDuration)      // 600ths

unsigned long *BuildTuneSequence(void)
{
   unsigned long   *sequence, *w;

   // Allocate space for the tune sequence, rather inflexibly.
   sequence = (unsigned long *) NewPtrClear(our_sequence_length);
   if (!sequence)
      goto goHome;
   w = sequence;
   _StuffNoteEvent(*w++, 1, 60, 100, kNoteDuration);      // piano C
   _StuffRestEvent(*w++, kRestDuration);
   _StuffNoteEvent(*w++, 2, 60, 100, kNoteDuration);      // violin C
   _StuffRestEvent(*w++, kRestDuration);
   _StuffNoteEvent(*w++, 1, 63, 100, kNoteDuration);      // piano
   _StuffRestEvent(*w++, kRestDuration);
   _StuffNoteEvent(*w++, 2, 64, 100, kNoteDuration);      // violin
   _StuffRestEvent(*w++, kRestDuration);

   // Make the 5th and 6th notes much softer, just for fun.
   _StuffNoteEvent(*w++, 1, 67, 60, kNoteDuration);       // piano
   _StuffRestEvent(*w++, kRestDuration);
   _StuffNoteEvent(*w++, 2, 66, 60, kNoteDuration);       // violin
   _StuffRestEvent(*w++, kRestDuration);
   _StuffNoteEvent(*w++, 1, 72, 100, kNoteDuration);      // piano
   _StuffRestEvent(*w++, kRestDuration);
   _StuffNoteEvent(*w++, 2, 73, 100, kNoteDuration);      // violin
   _StuffRestEvent(*w++, kRestDuration);
   _StuffNoteEvent(*w++, 1, 60, 100, kNoteDuration);      // piano
   _StuffNoteEvent(*w++, 1, 67, 100, kNoteDuration);      // piano
   _StuffNoteEvent(*w++, 2, 63, 100, kNoteDuration);      // violin
   _StuffNoteEvent(*w++, 2, 72, 100, kNoteDuration);      // violin
   _StuffRestEvent(*w++, kRestDuration);
   *w++ = 0x60000000;   // end-of-sequence marker

goHome:
   return sequence;
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
It's important to understand that the duration of a sequence equals the total durations of<br>
all the rest events. The durations within the note events don't contribute to the<br>
duration of the sequence! If two note events occur in a row, each with a duration of say<br>
100, they'll both start at the same time, not 100 time units apart. If the next event is<br>
an end-of-sequence marker, the notes will immediately be stopped, having played for<br>
zero time units. If, however, a rest event is placed between the note events and the end<br>
marker, both notes will sound for the duration of the rest event, up to 100 time units.
</p>
<h2>PLAYING A TUNE WITH THE TUNE PLAYER</h2>
<p>
Playing a tune with the tune player component is ideal if for some reason your<br>
application will be constructing a tune at run time and then playing it. For prescored<br>
music, however, the best solution is to create a QuickTime movie containing only a<br>
music track and play it as a regular movie with the Movie Toolbox, as described below.
</p>
<p>
Using the tune player to play a tune without application intervention is<br>
straightforward, as illustrated in Listing 7. After building the tune with<br>
BuildTuneHeader and BuildTuneSequence, this routine opens up a connection to the tune<br>
player component, calls TuneSetHeader with a pointer to the header information, and<br>
then calls TuneQueue with a pointer to the sequence data. All the details of playback are<br>
taken care of by the tune player. The tune will stop playing when it reaches the end or<br>
when the tune player component is closed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 7. </b>Playing a tune with the tune player component
</p>
<pre>void BuildSequenceAndPlay(void)
{
   unsigned long      *header, *sequence;
   TunePlayer         tp;
   TuneStatus         ts;
   ComponentResult   thisError;

   tp = 0;
   header = BuildTuneHeader();
   sequence = BuildTuneSequence();
   if (!header || !sequence)
      goto goHome;
   tp = OpenDefaultComponent(kTunePlayerType, 0);
   if (!tp)
      goto goHome;
   thisError = TuneSetHeader(tp, header);
   thisError = TuneQueue(tp, sequence, 0x00010000, 0, 0x7FFFFFFF,
                           0, 0, 0);

   // Wait until the sequence finishes playing or the user clicks
   // the mouse.
spin:
   thisError = TuneGetStatus(tp, &amp;ts);
   if (ts.queueTime &amp;&amp; !Button())
      goto spin;      // I use gotos primarily to shock the children.

goHome:
   if (tp)
      CloseComponent(tp);
   if (header)
      DisposePtr((Ptr) header);
   if (sequence)
      DisposePtr((Ptr) sequence);
}</pre>

<h2>PLAYING PRESCORED MUSIC IN A QUICKTIME MOVIE</h2>
<p>
The best way to play prescored music is to create a QuickTime movie with just a music<br>
track and play it with the Movie Toolbox, which takes care of details like spooling<br>
multiple segments of sequence data from disk. This is currently the only way to create<br>
QuickTime music that will also play under QuickTime for Windows. There are many<br>
tools for authoring music into Standard MIDI Files, which are then easily imported as<br>
QuickTime movies -- but first let's look at the more hard-core method of creating<br>
your own sequence and header data and saving it as a QuickTime movie.
</p>
<p>
<b>CREATING A QUICKTIME MUSIC TRACK</b>
</p>
<p>
Creating a QuickTime music track is exactly the same as creating any other kind of<br>
track. You create or open the movie you're adding the track to, and then add a new track<br>
and a new media followed by a sample description and the sample data. For a music<br>
track, the sample description is the tune header information, and the data is one or<br>
more tune sequences. The routine in Listing 8 constructs a QuickTime movie with a<br>
music track and saves it to disk.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 8. </b>Creating a QuickTime music track
</p>
<pre>void BuildMusicMovie(void)
{
   ComponentResult      result;
   StandardFileReply      reply;
   short                resRefNum;
   Movie                mo;
   Track                tr;
   Media                me;
   unsigned long          *tune, *header;
   MusicDescription       **mdH, *md;

   StandardPutFile("\pMusic movie file name:", "\pMovie File",
                   &amp;reply);
   if (!reply.sfGood)
      goto goHome;
   EnterMovies();

   // Create the movie, track, and media.
   result = CreateMovieFile(&amp;reply.sfFile, 'TVOD', smCurrentScript,
      createMovieFileDeleteCurFile, &amp;resRefNum, &amp;mo);
   if (result)
      goto goHome;
   tr = NewMovieTrack(mo, 0, 0, 256);
   me = NewTrackMedia(tr, MusicMediaType, 600, nil, 0);

   // Create a music sample description.
   header = BuildTuneHeader();
   mdH = (MusicDescription **)
      NewHandleClear(sizeof(MusicDescription) - 4 +
         our_header_length);
   if (!mdH)
      goto goHome;
   md = *mdH;
   md-&gt;descSize = GetHandleSize((Handle) mdH);
   md-&gt;dataFormat = kMusicComponentType;
   BlockMove(header, md-&gt;headerData, our_header_length);
   DisposePtr((Ptr) header);

   // Get a tune, add it to the media, and then finish up.
   tune = BuildTuneSequence();
   result = BeginMediaEdits(me);
   result = AddMediaSample(me, (Handle) &amp;tune, 0,
      our_sequence_length, our_sequence_duration,
      (SampleDescriptionHandle) mdH, 1, 0, nil);
   result = EndMediaEdits(me);
   result = InsertMediaIntoTrack(tr, 0, 0, our_sequence_duration,
      (1L<<16));
   result = OpenMovieFile(&amp;reply.sfFile, &amp;resRefNum, fsRdWrPerm);
   result = AddMovieResource(mo, resRefNum, 0, 0);
   result = CloseMovieFile(resRefNum);
   DisposePtr((Ptr) tune);
   DisposeMovie(mo);

goHome:
   ExitMovies();

<p>
<b>IMPORTING A STANDARD MIDI FILE AS A MOVIE</b>
</p>
<p>
Most music content exists in a format called Standard MIDI File (SMF). All sequencing<br>
and composition programs have an option to Save As or Export files to this format.<br>
QuickTime has facilities for reading an SMF file and easily converting it into a<br>
QuickTime movie. (QuickTime 2.1 corrects some critical bugs in the 2.0 converter.)<br>
During any kind of conversion, the SMF file is assumed to be scored for a General MIDI<br>
device, and MIDI channel 10 is assumed to be a drum track.
</p>
<p>
The conversion to a QuickTime movie can happen in several ways. Because the<br>
conversion is implemented in a QuickTime 'eat ' component, it very often will happen<br>
automatically. Any application that uses the StandardGetFile routine to open a movie<br>
can also open 'Midi' files transparently, and can transparently paste Clipboard<br>
contents of type 'Midi' into a movie that's shown with the standard movie controller. To<br>
explicitly convert a file or handle into a movie, an application can use the Movie<br>
Toolbox routines ConvertFileToMovieFile and PasteHandleIntoMovie, respectively.
</p>
<p>
For those of you who are hard-core MIDI heads, the following two MIDI<br>
system-exclusive messages, new in QuickTime 2.1, may be useful for more precise<br>
control of the MIDI import process. (Note that QuickTime data is divided into media<br>
samples. Within video tracks, each video frame is considered one sample; in music<br>
tracks, each sample may contain several seconds worth of musical information.)
</p>
<ul>
<li>F0 11 00 01 xx yy zz F7 sets the maximum size of each media sample to<br>
the 21-bit number xxyyzz. (MIDI data bytes have the high bit clear, so they<br>
have only seven bits of number.) This message can occur anywhere in an SMF<br>
file.</li>
<li>F0 11 00 02 F7 marks an immediate sample break; it ends the current<br>
sample and starts a new one. All messages after a sample break message will<br>
be placed in a new media sample.

<p>
Applications can define their own system-exclusive messages of the form F0<br>
11 7F ww xx yy zz ... application-defined data ... F7, where ww xx yy zz is the<br>
application's unique signature with the high bits cleared. This is guaranteed<br>
not to interfere with Apple's or any other manufacturer's use of<br>
system-exclusive codes.*
</p></li></ul>
<h2>READING INPUT FROM A MIDI DEVICE</h2>
<p>
If the user has a MIDI keyboard attached to the computer, your application can use it as<br>
an input device by calling QTMA routines that capture each event as the user triggers<br>
it.
</p>
<p>
The default MIDI input is whichever MIDI port the user has chosen for a General MIDI<br>
device from the QuickTime Music control panel, shown in Figure 5. (The default MIDI<br>
input can also be specified with the NASetDefaultMIDIInput call in the note allocator,<br>
but this call should be made only by music-configuration software, such as the control<br>
panel.)

<b>Figure 5. The QuickTime Music control panel</b>
</p>
<p>
An application can receive MIDI events from the default MIDI input by installing a<br>
readHook routine. This routine is called at interrupt level whenever MIDI data<br>
arrives. It's installed with the NAUseDefaultMIDIInput call (and later deinstalled with<br>
NALoseDefaultMIDIInput).
</p>
<pre>pascal ComponentResult NAUseDefaultMIDIInput(NoteAllocator na,
   MusicMIDIReadHookUPP readHook, long refCon, unsigned long flags);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The readHook routine is defined as follows:
</p>
<pre>typedef pascal ComponentResult (*MusicMIDIReadHookProcPtr)
   (MusicMIDIPacket *mp, long myRefCon);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When the readHook routine is called, it's passed its refCon (installed with the routine)<br>
and a pointer to the MIDI packet. The MIDI packet structure is simply a list of bytes of<br>
a MIDI message, preceded by a length:
</p>
<pre>struct MusicMIDIPacket {
   unsigned short   length;
   unsigned long   reserved;
   UInt8            data[249];
};</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The length field is the number of bytes in the MIDI message. (If you're familiar with<br>
the MIDI Manager definition of a MIDI packet or with OMS's packet, note that their<br>
length field is different from this one: Theirs is the length of both the header and the<br>
packet data, so the minimum length would be 6; but in QuickTime's packets, the length<br>
field is only the number of bytes of MIDI data actually in the data array.)
</p>
<p>
In QuickTime 2.0, the reserved field must be set to 0, but in QuickTime 2.1, this field<br>
takes on some additional meanings (as reserved fields occasionally do). When an<br>
application is using the default MIDI input, it may occasionally lose the use of that<br>
input, such as when another application tries to use it, or if the instrument picker<br>
dialog box comes to the front. If the use of the input is lost, the reserved field will have<br>
the value kMusicPacketPortLost = 1, and the length field will be 0: no MIDI data. When<br>
the port is once again available, the readHook routine will receive a packet with the<br>
reserved field set to kMusicPacketPortFound = 2, also with no data.
</p>
<p>
The data array in the MIDI packet contains a raw MIDI message that your readHook<br>
routine will have to parse. Our example code parses only the MIDI messages for<br>
note-on events and note-off events; other messages, such as pitch-bend controls, are<br>
simply ignored.
</p>
<p>
The note-on event message has three bytes, 9c pp vv (in hexadecimal), where c is the<br>
MIDI channel that the musical keyboard is transmitting on, pp is a MIDI pitch from 0<br>
to 127 (60 is middle C), and vv is the velocity with which the key was struck, from 1<br>
to 127. If the velocity is 0, the message signifies a note-off event. Some devices,<br>
however, use a separate message type for note-off events; it has the form 8c pp vv,<br>
where c and pp are the channel and pitch, and vv is the velocity with which the key was<br>
released. Nobody in the world pays attention to the release velocity, so in our example<br>
we won't either. When an 8c message is received, we'll just set the velocity to 0 and<br>
pretend it was a 9c message.
</p>
<p>
Listing 9 shows a readHook routine and the routine that installs it. The main routine,<br>
UseMIDIInput, allocates a note channel and then calls NAUseDefaultMIDIInput,<br>
specifying a readHook routine that parses note-on or note-off event messages. These<br>
messages are expanded into a chord that's played on the note channel. Any packet that<br>
isn't of that type -- that is, doesn't contain three bytes or start with 0x8n or 0x9n --<br>
is ignored.

<h2>GIVE QTMA A TRY</h2>
<p>
Sometimes a little music can make your application easier and more fun to use. Adding<br>
music doesn't have to be a complex task; QTMA takes care of all the hard parts, like<br>
using MIDI protocols, so you can concentrate more on the music itself. So go ahead,<br>
play some tunes and enjoy the music!
