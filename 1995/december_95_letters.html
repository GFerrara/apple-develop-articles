<h2>LETTERS</h2>
<b>PROJECTDRAG IMPRESSES</b><br>
I've been working with Tim Maroney's ProjectDrag (Issue 23, "MPW Tips and Tricks:<br>
Customizing Source Control With SourceServer"), and I'm very impressed. I've never<br>
found an adequate way of using a revision control system on the Macintosh (Projector<br>
is too clumsy to use when you're developing with CodeWarrior), and I had written off<br>
SourceServer completely after I had such a miserable experience with it under<br>
Symantec C++ 7.0. But Tim's article and software have given that dog some new<br>
tricks. His&nbsp;&nbsp;programs are easy to use and powerful at the same time.<br>
<p>
Thank you very much for publishing&nbsp;&nbsp;Tim's work in this issue, and I hope to see more<br>
about ProjectDrag in the future.<br>
-- Phil Sulak
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for the feedback; we're happy to know that you find ProjectDrag useful.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>There were a few problems with the previous version of ProjectDrag, so on this</i><br>
<i>issue's CD you' ll find a new version with a few bug fixes and enhancements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the</i><br>
<i>previous version&nbsp;&nbsp;was missing the makefile; it's now on the CD.</i><br>

<b>QTMA</b><br>
I read the article on QTMA by David Van Brink in Issue 23, and have a few additional<br>
questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Director of Audio for Human Code (an Austin multimedia developer), I'm<br>
looking for a way to convey an other-worldly quality to the soundscape of a CD-ROM<br>
title we're developing.
</p>
<p>
First, is QTMA supported on the PC platform? If it only works on the Mac OS platform,<br>
I'm back to the drawing board.
</p>
<p>
Also, is it possible to seed a bank of custom-designed samples to be played using<br>
standard MIDI files with QTMA? If so, is there a developer 's guide available for<br>
programming within QTMA?<br>
-- John Malcolm Smith
</p>
<p>
<i>First of all, you've probably noticed that there were no changes to the Music </i><br>
<i>Architecture in QuickTime 2.1 after all. These changes have been delayed until the next</i><br>
<i>release of QuickT ime (which should ship by early 1996). The code on this issue's CD</i><br>
<i>has been revised so that it compiles with the 2.0 or 2.1 headers.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>On the PC side, QuickTime music tracks are supported, but only inside movies. So,</i><br>
<i>compose your score on the Macintosh, import it into a QuickTime movie using </i><br>
<i>MoviePlayer, and then save it flattened with the "Playable On Non-Apple Computers"</i><br>
<i>box checked.&nbsp;&nbsp;This movie will play through Windows' multimedia extensions, according</i><br>
<i>to its MIDI setup.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>As far as adding your own instruments,&nbsp;&nbsp;you should be able to do this in the next</i><br>
<i>QuickTime release in two ways: by dropping a component into the System Folder, to</i><br>
<i>make a sound libr ary available to all applications, or by inserting a sound into the</i><br>
<i>music track of a particular movie.</i><br>

<b>PUZZLE PAGE DOESN'T STINK</b><br>
Re Lance Drake's letter in Issue 22 entitled "Puzzle Page Stinks": I strongly disagree. <br>
The Puzzle Page is the first article I read. From it I've learned new debugging tactics,<br>
and picked up cool MacsBug tricks and how to do more than just "G" from MicroBug. <br>
The fact that the "scoring" shouldn't be taken literally is obvious; after all, KON &amp; BAL<br>
never get the answer till 10 or less. Don't let one humorless whiner ruin a good thing.<br>
Keep up the good work; develop is a great resource.<br>
-- Steve Palmen
</p>
<p>
I wanted to let you know how much I enjoy the Puzzle Page. I just graduated and was<br>
lucky enough to land a job programming on the Mac. Issue 22 is my first and I've<br>
already looked back at all of the&nbsp;&nbsp;previous Puzzles because I enjoy reading about the<br>
deepest, darkest Mac knowledge that I hope to stuff into my brain one day. It's<br>
refreshing to have a technical journal that's not afraid to crack a joke every couple of<br>
pages. I haven't felt offended or mocked by your Puzzle Page.<br>
-- Matt Glazier
</p>
<p>
I just want to let you know that there are people out here who read and enjoy the<br>
Puzzle Page. I try to&nbsp;&nbsp;follow every twist and turn in the logic that leads to the final<br>
result. I've tracked down a few bugs in my own code that were complex and obscure<br>
enough to end up on the Puzzle Page, and it's nice to see the steps someone else follows.<br>
-- David Shayer

<p>
<b>... WELL, MAYBE JUST A LITTLE</b><br>
The letter from Lance Drake in Issue 22 about the Puzzle Page was, as you wrote, a<br>
surprise to you. To me it wasn't. First I would like to state that the Puzzle Page is by<br>
far the best column in develop -- technically very interesting and also amusing. This<br>
explains the good feedback you receive on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the "scoring" tables are indeed<br>
belittling, elitist, and intellectually arrogant. Even worse, they are off ending. This is<br>
a detail, but it fully explains and justifies Mr. Drake's angry letter.<br>
-- Adriaan van Os
</p>
<p>
Many thanks for all the work you put into <i>d e v e l o p</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The production qualities are<br>
superb. I have only one complaint: get rid of KON &amp; BAL's Puzzle Page.&nbsp;&nbsp;I always feel<br>
depressed after reading it.<br>
-- Andrew Trevorrow

<b>FINGER-CODED BINARY VARIATION</b><br>
I'd like to comment on Tobias Engler's Finger-Coded Binary column in Issue 21. <br>
Although I agree with most of what he said,&nbsp;&nbsp;Tobias's approach, the 10-bit model, is<br>
far less natural than it needs to be. I find it much easier (at least more natural) to<br>
work with hands flat on the side of a table, using all fingers except thumbs -- this<br>
results in the more commonly used 8-bit model.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can then use your thumbs for<br>
other things, such as branch prediction, status registers, or even complex instruction<br>
execution.
</p>
<p>
I have one advantage over many people.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that I'm missing part of my right<br>
thumb enables me to do fractions. No other digital system I know of can do 0, 1/2, and<br>
1 digits.<br>
-- Martin-Gilles Lavoie
</p>
<p>
<i>There's much more to the 10-bit model than you seem to realize. Have you ever had</i><br>
<i>somebody tell you "You can eat as many Snickers bars as you can count on your</i><br>
<i>hands"? Probably not.&nbsp;&nbsp;You wouldn't want to stop at 256, would you?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Concerning your fractional thumb: Your technological advantage over conventional</i><br>
<i>digital systems will undoubtedly attract many copyists, which may result in a lot of</i><br>
<i>unnecessary bloodshed. My advice to you is go and get a patent!</i><br>
<i>-- Tobias Engler</i>
