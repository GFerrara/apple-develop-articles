<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>

From time to time people I know outside of Apple ask me what kind of Macintosh they<br>
should buy for home use. I in turn always ask what made them decide on a Macintosh in<br>
the first place. The answer is usually along the lines of "My kid has one at school and<br>
loves it" or "I use PCs at work but write my memos on a Macintosh, and I love my<br>
Mac." Typically they can't pinpoint the reasons for this "love." People enjoy using the<br>
Macintosh; you might say they're charmed by it.
</p>
<p>
Charm sells. I used to think my taste for older houses with all their nooks and crannies<br>
-- and yes, imperfections -- would work to my benefit in the real estate market. But<br>
in fact it seems that's what everyone wants. The houses that suit me are rarely put up<br>
for sale, their owners are so loathe to part with them; on those few occasions that they<br>
are on the market, they're sold in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newer, bigger houses that go<br>
for the same price sell much more slowly. 
</p>
<p>
So when I hear about how some new computer is expected to run infinitesimally faster<br>
than some other one, I'm not swayed. (You'd be amazed to learn the creaky model of the<br>
Macintosh I use at home for my personal tasks.) Through years of complaints about<br>
how slow and otherwise imperfect the Macintosh was, I just<i>knew</i> it would thrive. I<br>
don't think people in the home market, especially, are going to focus on performance<br>
measurements or the number of applications available. Of course they need reasonable<br>
speed and the necessary applications to do what they want to do -- but most of all they<br>
want a computer they'll enjoy using. They ask around, and they see where people's<br>
hearts lie in the computer-using world. Not that there won't be heartless millions<br>
choosing those other computers, but there will<i>always</i> be Macintosh. 
</p>
<p>
To quote from Tim Maroney's first installment of "MPW Tips and Tricks," in this<br>
issue: "I don't use my computer to run Dhrystone benchmarks: I use it to accomplish<br>
tasks."
</p>
<p>
As someone on the original Macintosh team, I'm not surprised by its appeal to the<br>
heart. We all succumbed very early to its charm. I remember the big meeting we had<br>
to decide the computer's name, "Macintosh" being a code name that we were resolved<br>
not to keep. But no other ideas for names -- what few there were -- gained headway.<br>
The reason "Macintosh" stuck wasn't because it was the name of an apple (if<br>
misspelled); it stuck because we'd all grown so fond of our little "Mac." It would have<br>
been like renaming our first born. 
</p>
<p>
Call me sentimental; I can take it. Call this my valentine to the Macintosh.

<b>CAROLINE ROSE </b>(AppleLink CROSE) started working at Apple in 1982 the first<br>
time, then again in 1991. In between, she learned what it's like to be among the first<br>
employees in a startup company run by Steve Jobs. She worked as a programmer back<br>
when any math major could pick it up pretty easily and when there were about three<br>
programming languages to choose from. Now that there are OODLs of languages out<br>
there, she's happy to be back to writing in English. Caroline stood out as an odd bird in<br>
grade school because she actually enjoyed diagramming sentences. (There are other<br>
reasons, too, but we won't go into those.) *
