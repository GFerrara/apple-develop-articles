<b>FLOATING WINDOWS AGAIN</b><br>
I'd like to use the library of functions for floating windows described in develop Issue<br>
15 by Dean&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu (updated on Issue 21's CD). I'm using CodeWarrior 5.5, and when I try<br>
to compile the sample project (or any other project that includes the<br>
WindowExtensions.h file)&nbsp;&nbsp;I get a "WindowRef redeclared" error. There&nbsp;&nbsp;seems to be a<br>
conflict with the universal headers. Before I try to get rid of this error myself (and<br>
probably make everything wrong), I thought I'd ask if you could suggest a simple and<br>
clean solution.<br>
-- Fred Klein<br>
<p>
<i>On this issue's CD is a new version of the floating windows library that fixes this</i><br>
<i>problem, and others. The problem was that Apple finally "caught up" with Dean and</i><br>
<i>defined things in the universal headers that he had defined, in his forward-looking</i><br>
<i>way, back when he first wrote the article. Also on the CD you'll find an even newer</i><br>
<i>version of the library that compiles with STRICT_WINDOWS defined. This necessitated</i><br>
<i>a complete rewrite of some portions of the code, so consider it risky. Please try it and</i><br>
<i>send me any bugs you find!</i><br>

<b>POWERPC ASSEMBLY NITS</b><br>
Great article on PowerPCTM assembly language in develop Issue 21! It was clear, and I<br>
learned a lot reading it. But I have two nitpicks. On page 27 you show glue code for a<br>
cross-TOC call.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second instruction should be
</p>
<pre>stw RTOC, 20(SP)</pre>
<p>
And the third instruction has a typo in it. It should be
</p>
<pre>lwz r0, 0(r12)</pre>
<p>
-- David Shayer
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for catching these. The interesting thing is that the second instruction appears</i><br>
<i>that (wrong) way in the PPCAsm manual. Whoops!</i><br>

<b>UP ON THE DOWNSIDE</b><br>
I just wanted to tell you that I really liked the&nbsp;&nbsp;Veteran Neophyte column in Issue 21,<br>
about the downside of programming. It struck a nerve with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that goes<br>
through my mind whenever I sit down to write some code is "There has to be a better<br>
way!"&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, by the time there is a better way, I will probably have moved on to some<br>
other profession.<br>
-- Jamie Osborne

<p>
Your Veteran Neophyte column on the pains of programming really struck a nerve (and<br>
not just because I have carpal tunnel syndrome). I often spend a while putting things<br>
on paper, only to abandon the project once I become convinced that I've figured out the<br>
solution and its implementation would just be hours and hours of typing. Sort of<br>
meta-programming.<br>
-- Tom Busey
</p>
<p>
I just finished reading the&nbsp;&nbsp;Veteran Neophyte columns in Issue 17 and&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 21, "Why<br>
We Do It" and "The Downside." They were given to me by&nbsp;&nbsp;a friend who is an avid<br>
programmer. The type of things you described sounded just like my friend; I think he<br>
showed the columns to me to explain why every time I see&nbsp;&nbsp;him he's sitting in front of<br>
the computer, and why he stays up till all hours of the morning working on programs<br>
that end up frustrating him.
</p>
<p>
I thought I should let you know that your columns were appreciated not only by those<br>
who program, but by those who are close to programmers and wonder sometimes what<br>
unseen force has gotten hold of them and sucked them into their work.<br>
-- Greta Meussling
</p>
<p>
<i>The "Downside" column seems to have hit home with many people; I got a lot of</i><br>
<i>comments about it. It's nice to be assured that I'm not the only reluctant programmer</i><br>
<i>in the world, and that I'm not the only one who thinks there ought to be a better way.</i><br>

<b>ACROBAT: PRETTY DARN FINE</b><br>
This probably isn't the first time you've heard this, but how about off ering develop in<br>
Acrobat (PDF format) as well? For me, Acrobat is more convenient than Apple<br>
DocViewer as an application and, most important, its files are a lot smaller. I<br>
routinely convert develop to PDF and then add PDF hyperlinks and bookmarks. For one<br>
issue I converted, for instance, the DocViewer version (without the index) is 2.9 meg,<br>
while the PDF version is only 770K. It's even smaller than the StuffIt version of the<br>
DocViewer document (1.2 meg). And the onscreen appearance is identical. I still like<br>
the HTML versions for their immediacy, but for true WYSIWYG, low conversion<br>
effort, and small file size, you can't beat PDF.<br>
-- Shannon Spires
</p>
<p>
<i>We agree with you. You'll notice that on this issue's CD, every issue of develop has</i><br>
<i>been converted to Acrobat -- along with all the other files on the CD that used to be in </i><br>
<i>Apple DocViewer format. Enjoy!</i><br>
<i>-- Caroline Rose</i>

<b>UP ON THE WEB</b><br>
Thanks for making both develop and&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple Directions available on the&nbsp;&nbsp;World Wide<br>
Web. We're on a very tight budget and can't afford a subscription at this time. The<br>
online versions allow us to access the infor - mation and still come out with a product<br>
on budget.<br>
-- Mattias Fornander
</p>
<p>
I'm a student who reads develop online via the Internet through UCLA's (UNIX &#174; )<br>
workstations. Your putting develop on the World Wide Web is great! Even though the<br>
comfort of reading (and printing) develop online&nbsp;&nbsp;will never equal the ease of the<br>
regular version, I don't have to fight with ftp and MS-DOS floppy disks to read your<br>
magazine. So please continue to publish develop in HTML.
</p>
<p>
IMHO, your magazine is a service to the Mac developer community, and you would help<br>
Apple by letting every possible programmer access it without hassle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for this<br>
effort.<br>
-- Eric Gouriou

<i>We've got articles from some issues of develop on the&nbsp;&nbsp;World Wide Web now (at</i><br>
<i>http://www.apple.com, in the Developer Services area) and are working on putting</i><br>
<i>more up there.&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of feedback helps make it happen -- so thanks for writing. </i><br>
<i>Readers of the online version: Don't confuse printed develop with the monthly&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple</i><br>
<i>Developer Mailing; a subscription to the monthly mailing (which includes a CD that</i><br>
<i>has develop on it) is rather costly, but it costs only $30 for four quarterly printed</i><br>
<i>issues of develop (with Bookmark CD). See the inside front cover of this issue for</i><br>
<i>ordering information. (Sorry, I couldn't resist this opportunity for a plug!)</i><br>

KEEP US ON OUR TOES! We welcome your nitpicking letters to the editors, especially<br>
regarding articles published in develop. Letters should be addressed to Caroline Rose<br>
-- or, if technical develop-related questions, to Dave Johnson -- at&nbsp;&nbsp;AppleLink CROSE<br>
or JOHNSON.DK. Or you can write to Caroline&nbsp;&nbsp;or Dave at Apple Computer, Inc., 1<br>
Infinite Loop, M/S 303-4DP, Cupertino, CA 95014. All letters should include your<br>
name and company name as well as your address and phone number. Letters may be<br>
excerpted or edited for clarity (or to make them say what we wish they did). *
