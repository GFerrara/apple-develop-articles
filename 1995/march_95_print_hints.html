</p>
<p>
One of the great features of QuickDraw GX is that it provides the printer driver<br>
developer with default implementations of commonly used routines. For example, just<br>
by specifying a few parameters in your driver's 'comm'<br>
(gxDeviceCommunicationsType) resource, your printer driver can connect to a<br>
printer either serially or through the Printer Access Protocol (PAP). You don't need<br>
to write a single line of communications code! 
</p>
<p>
Another powerful feature of QuickDraw GX is that you can ignore the default<br>
implementations of printer driver routines and write your own routines instead. This<br>
feature enables you to tailor your printer driver so that it can accommodate unique<br>
situations. The ability to modify bits and pieces of the printing system is especially<br>
useful when it comes to writing printer drivers with custom communications code or<br>
buffering routines. 
</p>
<p>
In general, to create custom communications code, youconfigure your driver's 'iobm'<br>
(gxUniversalIOPrefsType)resource, create a "not connected" 'comm' resource, and<br>
then override certain QuickDraw GX messages. For SCSI printers, however, you don't<br>
need to create the "not connected" resource, because a SCSI format of the 'comm'<br>
resource is already defined. We'll talk more about when you would want to use custom<br>
communications code, and how to write it, later in this column. 
</p>
<p>
Also covered is how to write custom buffering routines. You may want to use custom<br>
buffering if, for example, you already have code that you want to use or you want to<br>
increase printer performance by taking advantage of a hardware buffer that you have<br>
available. 
</p>
<p>
On this issue's CD, you'll find a sample printer driver called CustomWriter that<br>
illustrates how to implement "not connected" custom I/O and buffering. In addition,<br>
there's a sample LaserWriter IISC printer driver that shows how to create custom I/O<br>
code for a SCSI printer.
</p>
<p>
<b>CUSTOM I/O -- WHO NEEDS IT?</b><br>
The default communications code in QuickDraw GX handles asynchronous<br>
communications for serial and PAP printers and QuickDraw GX shared printers. Even<br>
so, you may want to override this code in some cases, such as if your printer<br>
communicates using a protocol that QuickDraw GX doesn't support (like 200<br>
Kbits/second serial), or if you have your own PAP code that you'd like to continue<br>
using. 
</p>
<p>
QuickDraw GX also supports the special cases of "not connected" printers and SCSI<br>
printers. If you're writing a driver using either of these two types of connections,<br>
you'll need to write some custom I/O code. In fact, the "not connected" communications<br>
method is provided specifically for the developer writing a driver containing custom<br>
communications code. What does this type of communications method do? In the default<br>
implementation, nothing at all. In a minute, you'll see how to use this to your<br>
advantage. 
</p>
<p>
The only SCSI support currently built into QuickDraw GX handles filling out the<br>
Chooser list with your devices' SCSI addresses and saving updated 'comm' resources for<br>
any desktop printers that are created. Otherwise, QuickDraw GX doesn't actually open<br>
connections or try to send commands, such as SCSIRead or SCSIWrite, to the printer.<br>
SCSI printers usually have unique command sets, and trying to provide a generic<br>
mechanism to support all of these devices is unrealistic. As a result, you must provide<br>
your own communications code if you're writing a SCSI driver. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, if your device is connected through a hardware interface that QuickDraw GX<br>
doesn't provide default support for (such as a NuBusTM card), you'll need to provide<br>
all of the communications code for your driver. 
</p>
<p>
<b>HOW TO GET STARTED</b><br>
The first step in writing a driver with custom communications code is to configure<br>
your driver's 'iobm' resource. This is a very easy (and very critical) exercise. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;'iobm' stands for </b>"Input/Output and Buffering preferences." So what does the "m"<br>
stand for? Great question. As it turns out, if you set up this resource incorrectly, it<br>
becomes an "I/O BooM" resource. (The system crashes.) The "m" is silent as long as<br>
the resource is set up correctly. *
</p>
<p>
The 'iobm' resource tells QuickDraw GX how your driver wants its communications and<br>
buffering environment set up. This resource has the following format:
</p>
<pre>type gxUniversalIOPrefsType {
    longint standardIO = 0x00000000,
            customIO = 0x00000001;
    longint;        // number of buffers to allocate,
                    // 0 = none
    longint;        // size of each buffer
    longint;        // number of IO requests that can
                    // be pending at any one time
    longint;        // open/close time-out in ticks
    longint;        // read/write time-out in ticks
};</pre>
<p>
The 'iobm' resource was described in the<i>develop</i> Issue 20 Print Hints column about<br>
QuickDraw GX buffering. Rather than reiterate that information here, we're going to<br>
briefly focus on the first three fields of the resource. 
</p>
<p>
The first item in the 'iobm' resource (standardIO or customIO) tells QuickDraw GX<br>
whether you want to use its built-in communications code. You must specify customIO<br>
if you want to use your own custom I/O code. When customIO is specified, QuickDraw<br>
GX won't go through the overhead of initialization and data allocation for the internal<br>
communications routines; as a result, you<i>must</i> override certain messages, as<br>
described in a following section. When you specify customIO, the last three longint<br>
fields of this resource are ignored. 
</p>
<p>
The two fields in the 'iobm' resource that follow the I/O type field indicate the number<br>
and size of the buffers your driver would like QuickDraw GX to create. Note that you<br>
can use QuickDraw GX's built-in buffering even if you're writing your own<br>
communications code. If, however, you're creating and disposing of your own buffers,<br>
you should set the "number of buffers" field to 0, so that QuickDraw GX won't waste<br>
time and memory allocating buffers that are never used. For code that communicates<br>
synchronously, multiple buffers don't improve performance, so you should set this<br>
field to 1. 
</p>
<p>
Later in this column we'll take a closer look at what's required to create and manage<br>
your own I/O buffers. 
</p>
<p>
<b>WHEN "NOT CONNECTED" MEANS "CONNECTED"</b><br>
Unless you're writing custom I/O routines to support a SCSI printer, you'll want to<br>
create a "not connected" 'comm' resource for your driver. Below is the declaration of a<br>
'comm' resource for the "not connected" case. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;For the full description </b> of a 'comm' resource, see <i>Inside Macintosh: QuickDraw</i><br>
<i>GX Printing Extensions and Drivers</i> .*
</p>
<pre>type gxDeviceCommunicationsType {
    unsigned longint = 'nops';
};</pre>
<p>
There's not a whole lot to it, is there? When you specify customIO in your 'iobm'<br>
resource, QuickDraw GX never does anything with your desktop printer's 'comm'<br>
resources other than examine the first longint. So, all sorts of possibilities become<br>
apparent. As long as that first longint is 'nops', you can extend the definition of this<br>
resource to suit your needs. Whether to change the definition of the resource in the<br>
PrintingResTypes.r interface file or not is up to you. Instead, you could just resize the<br>
resource when you update it at desktop printer creation time, as we'll discuss<br>
momentarily. 
</p>
<p>
<b>CUSTOM I/O -- THE MESSAGES</b><br>
When you supply your own I/O routines, there are several messages that you need to<br>
override. Some of these messages will always need to be<i>totally</i> overridden, meaning<br>
that your overrides for these messages should never forward the messages. Other<br>
messages should be<i>partially</i> overridden, in which case the message is forwarded at<br>
some point in your override code.
</p>
<p>
Now we'll look at the messages you need to override. (Table 1 summarizes these<br>
messages and the ones to override for custom buffering.) If you want more information<br>
on writingmessage overrides, see Sam Weiss's article, "DevelopingQuickDraw GX<br>
Printing Extensions,"&nbsp;&nbsp;in <i>develop</i> Issue 15, and<i>Inside Macintosh: QuickDraw GX</i><br>
<i>Printing Extensions and Drivers</i> .

<p>
<b>Always override (partially)</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>GXOpenConnection</li>
<li>GXCloseConnection</li>
<li>GXCleanupOpenConnection</li>
<li>GXWriteData</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you override these messages, you should first forward the message, then execute<br>
your added code. Your overrides for the first three messages should contain code to<br>
open and close a connection to your device.
</p>
<p>
GXCloseConnection is sent to close a connection if no errors occur during the device<br>
communications phase of printing; GXCleanupOpenConnection is sent if an error does<br>
occur during this time. The goal for both of these overrides is to "undo" any data<br>
allocation or initialization that occurred in the GXOpenConnection override. Often,<br>
your GXCleanupOpenConnection message override can simply execute the same code as<br>
your GXCloseConnection override. 
</p>
<p>
The GXWriteData override should forward the message(with a nil pointer and a length<br>
of 0) to flush any data that's buffered, and then send the data to the printer. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Always override (totally)</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>GXDumpBuffer</li>
</ul>
<p>
Your override for this message should execute code that sends the indicated data to your<br>
printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this message is sent, a connection to your device will already have<br>
been established through the successful execution of your GXOpenConnection override.<br>
The GXDumpBuffer message is used to send data to the printer whenever an I/O buffer<br>
becomes full.
</p>
<p>
<b>Usually override (partially)</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>GXDefaultDesktopPrinter</li>
<li>GXChooserMessage</li>
</ul>
<p>
When QuickDraw GX creates a desktop printer, it stores in it a 'comm' resource that<br>
specifies how to communicate with the printer. By default, this 'comm' resource is<br>
just a filled-in copy of one of your driver's 'comm' resources. Depending on the setting<br>
in the Chooser's "Connect via:" menu, the 'comm' resource is updated with information<br>
about the printer, such as the selected serial port, SCSI address, and network address<br>
for an AppleTalk printer. If your driver uses a "not connected" 'comm' resource (as<br>
described earlier), it will be copied verbatim, without updated information about the<br>
selected printer. As a result, you might need to step in and fill out the resource<br>
yourself. 
</p>
<p>
To update the 'comm' resource, you need to override the GXDefaultDesktopPrinter<br>
message as shown in Listing 1. Here we forward the message so that QuickDraw GX<br>
completes creation of the desktop printer; then we retrieve the 'comm' resource from<br>
the desktop printer, update it, and replace the old version with the updated version. 
</p>
<p>
When you update the 'comm' resource, you need to know which printer the user<br>
selected, as well as its addressing information and so forth. You can find this<br>
information by overriding GXChooserMessage, which is sent by the<br>
GXHandleChooserMessage API call. In this override, possibly with some help from your<br>
Chooser PACK's LDEF, you can determine the relevant information about the selected<br>
printer. 
</p>
<p>
For example, you can store this information in a column of cells that's appended to the<br>
printer list.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or you can store it in the list record's userHandle or, by using<br>
PC-relative addressing, in a data storage area following your jump table. When you<br>
retrieve this data in your GXChooserMessage override, simply store it using one of<br>
QuickDraw GX's global data functions for printing. Finally, retrieve the information<br>
from your GXDefaultDesktopPrinter override and store it in the desktop printer's<br>
'comm' resource. 
</p>
<p>
It's important to note that you can't use any of the functions<br>
GetMessageHandlerInstanceContext, SetMessageHandlerInstanceContext,<br>
GXGetJobRefCon,GXSetJobRefCon, and NewMessageGlobals for the example in Listing 1,<br>
because the GXChooserMessage and GXDefaultDesktopPrinter messages are sent to two<br>
different message handler instances. Therefore, you should use<br>
GetMessageHandlerClassContext, SetMessageHandlerClassContext, or some other<br>
method that works across message handler instances. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Sometimes override (totally)</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>GXFreeBuffer</li>
</ul>
<p>
If your communications code runs asynchronously, you must override GXFreeBuffer so<br>
that QuickDraw GX can tell when operations on a buffer have completed. The<br>
GXFreeBuffer message is sent to make sure that all the data in the buffer has been<br>
processed before the buffer is used again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When GXFreeBuffer returns, the indicated<br>
buffer is ready to accept more data. An override for this message should loop (calling<br>
GXJobIdle) until I/O on the specified buffer is complete, and then return.

<p>
<b>USING YOUR OWN BUFFERING SCHEME</b><br>
At this point, we've discussed everything that's needed to handle your own custom I/O<br>
code. Now we'll take a quick look at what's required if you want to create and maintain<br>
your own buffers, instead of using those that the default implementation provides. 
</p>
<p>
First things first. Go back to your 'iobm' resource, and set the number of buffers to 0.<br>
This tells QuickDraw GX not to waste time and memory allocating buffers that you<br>
aren't going to use. 
</p>
<p>
When you implement your own buffering scheme, you can use any sort of internal<br>
representation for your buffers that you want to. However, since some of the buffering<br>
messages take a pointer to a gxPrintingBuffer, you'll need to use that format for<br>
passing your buffers between certain messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as the actual buffer<br>
structures go, you can use a handle, a linked list, or any other configuration that's<br>
convenient or necessary to use. 
</p>
<p>
To support custom buffering code, you'll need to override the following messages. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Always override (partially)</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>GXOpenConnection</li>
<li>GXCloseConnection</li>
<li>GXCleanupOpenConnection</li>
</ul>
<p>
The partial overrides for these messages should forward the messages and then allocate<br>
or dispose of your internal buffer structures. If you're using custom I/O, you already<br>
provide overrides of these messages. In that case, simply add this new code to the<br>
existing overrides. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Always override (totally)</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>GXBufferData</li>
<li>GXWriteData</li>
</ul>
<p>
Provide an override of GXBufferData that stores the passed data in your next available<br>
buffer. If a buffer becomes full, call Send_GXDumpBuffer. Before you attempt to add<br>
data to this buffer again, call Send_GXFreeBuffer to make sure that all of the buffer's<br>
data has been sent to the printer. 
</p>
<p>
Your override for the GXWriteData message should flush all data from your buffers and<br>
then immediately send the passed data to the printer. To do this, call<br>
Send_GXDumpBuffer on all buffers, followed bySend_GXFreeBuffer on all buffers. If<br>
you're performingcustom I/O, just add this code to your existing override. 
</p>
<p>
You may wonder why you don't need to override the GXDumpBuffer message when you<br>
perform custom buffering. Unlike the messages listed above, GXDumpBuffer takes a<br>
pointer to a gxPrintingBuffer. Whenever your code calls Send_GXDumpBuffer, you<br>
must pass data in a gxPrintingBuffer structure, regardless of the internal buffer<br>
representation that you're using. Since the buffered data is passed in the format that<br>
GXDumpBuffer already expects, there's no need to override the message. 
</p>
<p>
<b>DRIVE SAFELY</b><br>
That's all there is to it. So, the next time someone asks, "Can you write QuickDraw GX<br>
printer drivers for my 200 Kbits/second serial typesetter, my SCSI copier/printer,<br>
and my NuBus-interfaced cutter plotter?" tell them, "Yoooooooou betcha!"
