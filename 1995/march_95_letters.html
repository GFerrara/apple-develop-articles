<b>BOOKMARK CD ALIAS PROBLEM</b><br>
On the <i>develop </i> Issue 19 Bookmark CD, there's an alias in the OpenDoc folder that can't<br>
be opened because it apparently thinks it's supposed to be on a disc with a different<br>
name than "Bookmark CD 19." What's the problem?<br>
-- Eric Shepherd<br>
<p>
<i>There was an alias (to "AppleScript TM 1.1") in the OpenDoc A6 folder that pointed to</i><br>
<i>the Developer CD. This slipped by us on the Issue 19 Bookmark CD; it should have</i><br>
<i>pointed to a file explaining that the software was on the Developer CD or could be</i><br>
<i>obtained through APDA. (Occasionally, we're unable to publish certain software</i><br>
<i>packages on the Bookmark CD.) Thanks for pointing this out; we're now checking more</i><br>
<i>carefully for such things.</i> -- <i>Alex Dosher</i>

<b>HOW NOT TO DO PREFERENCES?</b><br>
When I saw the article on writing preferences files in Issue 18, I thought it would be<br>
great to finally have someone explain how to do it properly. But the article didn't<br>
really do that, at least not in my opinion, and it didn't agree with what Apple software<br>
does.
</p>
<p>
For one thing, I really think preferences files should use the 'pref' file type; it keeps<br>
down the time it takes for the Finder to display the contents of the Preferences folder,<br>
it automatically gives the files the correct icon, and it avoids the foolishness of having<br>
to register two creators for every application. The Finder should be revised so that<br>
double-clicking a file of type 'pref' gives the "can't open preferences file" alert.<br>
Programmers should not need to put what is effectively a fixed string in every<br>
preferences file. Balloon Help on a file of type 'pref' should yield something sensible<br>
instead of erroneously naming the file as the Finder's preferences file, especially<br>
since many other preferences files already use the 'pref' type.
</p>
<p>
Most of the rest of the article was on target, especially the bit about not putting static<br>
data in the preferences folder. But there was no comment about where static, shared<br>
data should go. The trend seems to be to drop everything into the Extensions folder, but<br>
it would be better if a new "Data" or "Shared" folder were created in the System Folder<br>
to support these shared resources.<br>

<i>I find little to disagree with in your note. I've received other messages on this subject,</i><br>
<i>many containing the same good suggestions, among others.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I'll be the first to admit that several of the methods I describe in the article are, in</i><br>
<i>their best light, convoluted, and at worst, an unpleasant hack. The article reviewers</i><br>
<i>and I discussed the issues with Apple engineers and human interface folks, and nobody</i><br>
<i>could come up with a better solution for the system as it exists today. (Maybe the title</i><br>
<i>should have been "A Good Way to Implement Preferences Files" instead of "The Right</i><br>
<i>Way . . .") I tried to codify the current thinking at Apple on the best way&nbsp;&nbsp;to handle</i><br>
<i>preferences files in the existing system software environment, and I think I achieved</i><br>
<i>that goal.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I'm actually pleased (in a perverse sort of way) that the article has created somewhat</i><br>
<i>of a stir: it highlights the problems in this area faced by developers better than</i><br>
<i>anything I might write. Granted, in the overall scheme of things preferences files are</i><br>
<i>rather low on the totem pole, but still, this discussion may provide some impetus at</i><br>
<i>Apple to fix things in a subsequent system release. At that time, I'll be more than</i><br>
<i>happy to revisit the topic and do away with the two-creator hack forever!</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>It was also pointed out to me that the preferences library doesn't include any provision</i><br>
<i>for handling cross- platform issues, and that because it's resource-based, it precludes</i><br>
<i>the possibility of being cross-platform. What can I say? This is what happens when</i><br>
<i>your thinking is too Mac-centric. Even though I don't work at Apple any more, I'm still</i><br>
<i>a hopeless Mac fanatic!</i><br>

<b>OBJECT-ORIENTED LISTS</b><br>
The article on hierarchical lists in Issue 18 was especially interesting to me because<br>
I'm writing an object-oriented database and need to display large amounts of<br>
hierarchically organized objects. I'm using the PowerPlant library LListBox class;<br>
however, I want to be able to display icons and triangular buttons along with styled<br>
text, so I've started adding LDEF modifications to achieve that. The LDEF approach,<br>
being ultimately based on the List Manager, will have problems with large lists. Any<br>
suggestions you may have would be greatly appreciated.<br>
-- Maynard Chen
</p>
<p>
<i>You're in luck; we just happen to have a followup article with the information you</i><br>
<i>need. See "An Object- Oriented Approach to Hierarchical Lists" in this issue.</i><br>

<b>FLOATING WINDOWS UPDATE</b><br>
Recently, when I tried to use the floating windows library that was described in <br>
<i>develop </i> Issue 15, I ran into a few problems getting it to work with the universal<br>
headers (the library relies on SysEqu.h for the existence of the WindowList global<br>
variable). I'm trying to recompile this library for use with my CodeWarrior projects<br>
(MPW and I have had a falling out over speed!) but I'm having problems. Is there a<br>
more recent version of the code than the one on the June 1994 CD? If not, can you tell<br>
me how to fix it?<br>
-- David A. denBoer
</p>
<p>
<i>An updated version of the floating windows code appears on this issue's CD. The only</i><br>
<i>changes to the code were to replace SysEqu.h with LowMem.h in the includes, and to </i><br>
<i>change GetWindowList and SetWindowList to use the new low-memory accessor</i><br>
<i>routines. The sample application was also revamped slightly to compile in</i><br>
<i>CodeWarrior.</i><br>

<b>SPOTTED DICK REVEALED</b><br>
The British dessert "spotted dick" seems to have become a running joke in <i> develop</i> .<br>
You've got me curious. Can your technical staff do some research and give us the scoop<br>
on this?<br>
-- Steven C. Johnson
</p>
<p>
<i>Spotted dick is Reason #87 on the list of Why There Will Always Be an England.</i><br>
<i>(Reason #112 is "The word Worcester is pronounced Wooster.") A dick is a steamed</i><br>
<i>dessert cake, or "pudding," made of suet (or shortening), flour, and other ingredients</i><br>
<i>(like sugar) to make it taste good. It's usually served hot, with a milky syrup the</i><br>
<i>British refer to as custard. If you add currants to the recipe, the dick ends up having</i><br>
<i>spots, hence the name "spotted dick."</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>In a recent edition of The Patrick O'Brian Newsletter (he being a favorite author of</i><br>
<i>mine), I was surprised to see a reference to this dessert as Spotted Dog, along with the</i><br>
<i>variations Drowned Baby (glutinous surface), plum duff (prunes), figgy-dowdy</i><br>
<i>(raisins), and roly-poly (rolled and spread with jam).</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Surely this is more than you ever wanted to know. But for the terminally curious, I've</i><br>
<i>got an actual recipe. Douglas Norton (of -- you guessed it -- Great Britain) sent it in</i><br>
<i>"just to show that someone does read the little pieces at the bottom of the page."</i><br>
