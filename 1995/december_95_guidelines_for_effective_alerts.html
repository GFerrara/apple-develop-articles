<p>
<i>This article expands on the Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines for making</i><br>
<i>attractive, helpful alerts (and dialogs) with a standard appearance and behavior.</i><br>
<i>Standardization is important, because the more familiar an alert looks to users, the</i><br>
<i>more easily they can concentrate on the message. Using the Finder as a source of good</i><br>
<i>alerts, we provide examples of different alert types and discuss how to make alerts</i><br>
<i>user-friendly.</i>
</p>
<p>
Alerts are an in-your-face way of getting the user's attention. It's hard for a user to<br>
ignore alerts because they block all other input to the application until the user<br>
dismisses them. These little windows are powerful stuff. When used correctly, alerts<br>
are a helpful way to inform the user of a serious condition that requires immediate<br>
attention. When used incorrectly or capriciously, alerts are annoying and disruptive;<br>
since they must constantly be swatted out of the way, their content is often ignored.
</p>
<p>
This article discusses when to use alerts, describes the different types of alerts, and<br>
gives tips for designing alert boxes. It elaborates and expands on alert guidelines in the<br>
<i>Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines</i>. At the end of the article, you're encouraged to<br>
try your hand at evaluating some real-life alerts.
</p>
<p>
Though not implemented as such in the system, alert boxes are essentially a type of<br>
modal dialog box. This article focuses on alerts, but the guidelines can be applied to<br>
other dialog boxes as well. We specifically cover status dialogs here because there are<br>
guidelines that are unique to that type of dialog.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>For information on implementing</b> alerts and dialogs in your application,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see<i>Inside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox Essentials</i>.*
</p>
<h2>ALERTS IN GENERAL</h2>
<p>
Alerts provide information about error conditions and warn users about potentially<br>
hazardous situations. They should be used only when the user's participation is<br>
essential; in all other cases, try using another mechanism to get your point across. For<br>
example, consider an error or output log if the messages are something that the user<br>
may want to save.
</p>
<p>
The <i>Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines</i> haven't caught up yet with the main<br>
recommendation in this article: that alerts be movable and application modal. The<br>
current interface guidelines and system software don't allow alerts to be movable, but<br>
this may change in future versions of the Mac OS. Until then, you can implement your<br>
alerts as movable modal dialogs.
</p>
<p>
Making alerts movable is helpful in case an alert is covering information on the screen<br>
that the user would like to see before responding to the alert. Another advantage to<br>
movable alerts is that they have a title, which gives the user a context for the error.
</p>
<p>
<i>Application modal</i> means the alert is modal in the current application only: the user<br>
can't interact with this application while the alert is on the screen, but can switch to<br>
another application. This is especially useful when the user needs to get information<br>
from another application in order to respond to the alert. (<i>System modal,</i> on the other<br>
hand, means the user can't interact with the system at all except within the alert box.)
</p>
<h2>TYPES OF ALERTS</h2>
<p>
Alerts come in three varieties, each of which is geared to a different situation. This<br>
section provides a few examples of each type, and also takes a look at status dialogs.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOW HEAR THIS: NOTE ALERTS</b>
</p>
<p>
A <i>note alert</i> simply conveys information, informing the user about a situation that has<br>
no drastic effects and requires no further action. For example, if a user selects a word<br>
and executes a spell check, an alert saying that the word is spelled correctly would be a<br>
note alert. Rather than provide a smorgasbord of options, a note alert contains a single<br>
button to dismiss the alert.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't use an alert to signify completion of a task; use alerts only for situations that<br>
require the user to acknowledge what has occurred. For example, the following note<br>
alerts are inappropriate and get in the user's way:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Trash has finished emptying.</li>
<li>The 3,432 files you selected have been copied.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>WATCH OUT! CAUTION ALERTS</b>
</p>
<p>
Caution alerts warn users of potentially dangerous or unexpected situations. You<br>
should use them, for example, to be sure the user wants to proceed with a task that<br>
might have undesirable results. In this case the alert normally contains only two<br>
buttons -- one that cancels the operation and one that confirms it. Here are two<br>
caution alert messages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An item named "READ ME" already exists in this location. Do you want to<br>
replace it with the one you're moving?</li>
<li>The Trash contains 1 item. It uses 102K of disk space. Are you sure you<br>
want to permanently remove it?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Don't use alerts to confirm operations that would cause only a minor inconvenience if<br>
performed by mistake. Here are two examples of unnecessary caution alerts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you really want to eject the disk "Installer"?</li>
<li>Do you really want to duplicate the selected item?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Caution alerts are also used when an unexpected situation occurs and the user needs to<br>
decide what to do next. The following examples contain only two buttons, for canceling<br>
or confirming the operation, but such an alert may present several choices if<br>
appropriate.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The document "Calendar" is locked, so you will not be able to save any<br>
changes. Do you want to open it anyway?</li>
<li>The item "Calendar" could not be deleted, because it contains items that<br>
are in use. Do you want to continue?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before deciding to use this type of alert, double-check to see if it's really needed;<br>
superfluous alerts are a bad idea because users will get in the habit of dismissing<br>
alerts and possibly let an important one go by. It's better to have a user make choices<br>
with commands instead of alerts. For example, the Finder has separate Shut Down and<br>
Restart commands (in its Special menu) instead of having only a Shut Down command<br>
with an alert asking "Restart after shutting down?"
</p>
<p>
<b>HOLD IT: STOP ALERTS</b>
</p>
<p>
Use a <i>stop alert</i> when calling attention to a serious problem that prevents an action<br>
from being completed. They typically have only one button, to dismiss the alert. Here<br>
are two good examples of stop alerts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot copy "Calendar" onto the shared disk "Zippy" because the disk<br>
is locked.</li>
<li>The alias "Calendar" could not be opened, because the original item could<br>
not be found.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's especially important in stop alerts to give enough detail about the problem to help<br>
the user prevent it in the future. The following alert message doesn't convey much<br>
useful information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot rename the item "Zowie".</li>
</ul>
<p>
This alternative is more helpful:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The name "Zowie" is already taken. Please use a different name.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Similarly, if the chosen name is too long, it's more helpful for the message to state the<br>
maximum number of characters a filename can have.
</p>
<p>
<b>EVERYTHING IS OK: STATUS DIALOGS</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>Status dialogs</i> inform the user when an application is busy and the user cannot<br>
continue working in the application until the operation finishes. In the Finder, these<br>
operations include copying, moving, and deleting files. Status dialogs should be<br>
displayed whenever the application is busy for more than about five seconds (unless<br>
posting and updating the dialog would take most of that time). During this time the<br>
application should also change the pointer to the standard wristwatch.A status dialog<br>
differs from an alert in that the user doesn't need to explicitly dismiss the dialog; it<br>
goes away on its own once the task has completed. The dialog should contain a message<br>
that describes the status of the operation and a progress indicator to show how much of<br>
the job has been completed. A status dialog may change messages depending on the stage<br>
of operation. Figure 1 shows a status dialog at two stages of a copy operation.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/262.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1. </b>Status dialog during a copy operation
</p>
<p>
A sense of completion is important, so the application should be sure not to remove the<br>
status dialog until the progress indicator shows that the operation is done (such as by<br>
completely filling up the status bar in the example in Figure 1).
</p>
<h2>ICONS IN ALERT BOXES</h2>
<p>
Alert boxes always contain an icon that identifies the type of alert, as shown in Figure<br>
2. (Status dialogs contain no icon.) If you implement your alerts as movable modal<br>
dialogs, there's no Toolbox infrastructure set up for getting the correct icon<br>
automatically, so you'll need to remember which one to use.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2. </b>Icons for specific alert types
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A note on OpenDoc and alert icons:</b> OpenDoc part editors aren't as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visible to the user as today's applications, but at times it may be important<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for users to make the connection between a running editor and its stored<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;representation on disk. One such time is when the editor is reporting an error<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about itself, such as an incompatible version; for these errors, the alert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should contain the icon of the editor instead of a note, caution, or stop icon.
</p>
<h2>WRITING ALERT MESSAGES</h2>
<p>
The alert message is the most important component of an alert. You want users to read<br>
and respond to your alerts easily and then continue smoothly with their work. This<br>
section gives tips on structure, content, tone, and other important factors in writing<br>
effective alert messages.
</p>
<p>
<b>SITUATION, REASON, SOLUTION</b>
</p>
<p>
Every alert message should start by describing the situation that led to the alert,<br>
letting the user know what's wrong. This is usually followed by the reason the problem<br>
occurred and a proposed solution to the problem. When describing the situation that<br>
caused an alert, be as specific as possible, to help the user understand the problem.
</p>
<p>
Giving the reason the alert occurred is especially helpful when the application can't do<br>
something because it's dependent on some other operation that it can't control. For<br>
example, compare these messages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The alias "Warne" could not be opened.</li>
<li>The alias "Warne" could not be opened because the shared disk "Beatrix"<br>
could not be found on the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first message doesn't give the user any information about why the problem<br>
occurred. Is the application that created the document missing? Is the file corrupted?<br>
The second message is much better because it tells the user why the operation could not<br>
be completed.
</p>
<p>
Whenever possible, alerts should indicate a solution for the user. Users become<br>
extremely frustrated when an alert says something is wrong but doesn't offer a remedy<br>
to the problem. Even worse is an alert that tells the user something is wrong when the<br>
application could have fixed the problem itself. The following would be a bad message<br>
because the Finder is capable of quitting all the applications on its own:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You must quit all running applications before shutting down your<br>
Macintosh.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In cases where the application can perform the action itself, consider whether doing so<br>
may surprise the user; if so, presenting a caution alert may be more appropriate. For<br>
example, if the user attempts to shut down a Macintosh while other users have it<br>
mounted as a server, the Finder could just disconnect the other users automatically;<br>
however, in this case it's more helpful to present an alert confirming the shutdown.
</p>
<p>
<b>BE CONSISTENT</b>
</p>
<p>
Be sure your alert messages are consistent in tone, content, and structure with each<br>
other as well as with other messages your software presents to the user. Are your<br>
application's alerts consistent with its status messages, for example? Do all your<br>
alerts refer to the application in a consistent manner? Users pick up on small<br>
inconsistencies, and even subtle differences can cause confusion.
</p>
<p>
<b>BE BRIEF</b>
</p>
<p>
Alert messages should be brief and to the point, to keep the user's attention. If you need<br>
to give a lot of information, consider writing it to an error log or providing a brief<br>
message in the alert along with a button to get to the application's help system.
</p>
<p>
If you absolutely have to put a long message in an alert, keep in mind that many people<br>
have PowerBook computers or "classic" Macintosh computers with small screens. A<br>
good rule of thumb is that an alert message must consist of no more than 150<br>
characters to fit on a small screen. Also note that translation from English to other<br>
languages tends to expand the length of the message. Even translations into languages<br>
that use Roman characters can cause the message length to double or triple in size.
</p>
<p>
<b>BE ENCOURAGING</b>
</p>
<p>
Use a positive and constructive tone. After encountering a problem and being presented<br>
with an alert, the last thing the user wants is an overly negative response from the<br>
application. Avoid assigning blame or offending users. Don't accuse them of doing<br>
something wrong or stupid. Instead, give the reason an action cannot be performed, or<br>
offer to perform the action. Which message would you rather see?
</p>
<ul>
<li>You forgot to save your changes!</li>
<li>Save changes to access privileges for "Zippy"?</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>PHRASING AND TERMINOLOGY</b>
</p>
<p>
Don't use double negatives, such as "No items are not used." They're difficult for users<br>
to understand and just bad English. Double negatives can be especially confusing when<br>
combined with a Cancel button; the user rarely gets the expected outcome.
</p>
<p>
Keep the situation and action in the present. This is clearer and usually requires fewer<br>
words. For example, compare these two messages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An item named "READ ME" already existed in this location. Did you want to<br>
replace it with the one you moved?</li>
<li>An item named "READ ME" already exists in this location. Do you want to<br>
replace it with the one you're moving?</li>
</ul>
<p>
If there's an implied subject of a message, it should be the application. For example, if<br>
the user tries to open a document that the application can't open (as when it runs out of<br>
memory), the alert message might begin "Cannot open document." Messages in which<br>
the user or some other noun could be the implied subject are more likely to be<br>
confusing -- for example, "Have exceeded allotted network time. Try again later."
</p>
<p>
Use terms that are familiar to the user. This often means avoiding computer jargon at<br>
all costs. Remember, terms that seem common to you may be unfamiliar to many<br>
Macintosh users. It depends on what type of user will be working with your<br>
application. For example, the expression <i>establishing a connection</i> may be clearer than<br>
<i>handshaking</i> to many users.
</p>
<p>
Use <i>invalid</i> instead of <i>illegal</i>. The user hasn't broken the law, but has simply given the<br>
application some information that it can't handle.
</p>
<p>
<b>PUNCTUATION AND CAPITALIZATION</b>
</p>
<p>
Alert messages should always be complete sentences, beginning with a capital letter<br>
and ending with a period or question mark. The closing punctuation gives a sense of<br>
completion and lets the user know that the message hasn't been truncated.
</p>
<p>
Don't use colons when requesting that the user supply information; instead, use a<br>
period. This makes your alerts consistent with other dialogs and user interface<br>
elements in the system software.
</p>
<p>
Use an apostrophe ('), typed with Option-Shift-], rather than a single straight<br>
quotation mark ('), and use curly (" ") rather than straight (") double quotation<br>
marks -- that is, Option-[ and Option-Shift-[, rather than Shift-'.
</p>
<p>
Use double quotation marks around any names in the message that are variable, such as<br>
names of documents, folders, and search strings. This lets the user know exactly what<br>
part of the message is the name. Remember that Macintosh filenames can contain<br>
spaces, which can make things really confusing without the quotes. Commas, periods,<br>
and other punctuation characters should be placed outside the quotation marks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot duplicate the shared disk "Warne", because the disk is locked.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Never use an exclamation point or all uppercase letters. It makes users feel as if<br>
they're being shouted at, as in this example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Revert to the saved version of "Map"? WARNING! All changes will be lost!</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>STATUS MESSAGES</b>
</p>
<p>
In status dialogs, use an ellipsis (Option-semicolon, a character that looks like three<br>
periods) to indicate that an intermediate process is under way:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparing to copy...</li>
<li>Scanning "My Document"...</li>
</ul>
<p>
For describing the status of a task, the terms <i>canceled, failed, in progress</i>, and<br>
<i>complete</i> are good choices. Avoid computer jargon such as <i>aborted, killed, died</i>, or<br>
<i>ack'ed</i>.
</p>
<h2>ALERT TITLES</h2>
<p>
Every movable alert should have an informative title, to provide a context for the<br>
alert. Users may be working on several tasks at the same time and may not remember<br>
what action generated the alert. A well-chosen title helps the user figure out not only<br>
which application caused the alert to appear, but also which action.
</p>
<p>
The title of the alert should be the same as, or closely related to, the command or<br>
action that generated the alert. (If the command has an ellipsis in it, don't include the<br>
ellipsis in the alert title.) For example, when a user copies or duplicates an item in<br>
the Finder, the associated status dialog has the title "Copy"; when the user chooses<br>
Empty Trash, the title of the Finder's status dialog is "Trash."
</p>
<p>
Like menu commands, alert titles are capitalized like book titles. Capitalize every<br>
word except articles (<i>a, an, the</i>), coordinating conjunctions (for example, <i>and, or</i>),<br>
and prepositions of three or fewer characters (except when the preposition is part of a<br>
verb phrase, as in "Turn Off").
</p>
<h2>ALERT BUTTONS</h2>
<p>
Alerts contain buttons that dismiss the alert or allow the user to make choices<br>
regarding how to proceed. The standard button height is 20 pixels.
</p>
<p>
Try to limit the number of buttons that appear in an alert. The more buttons, the more<br>
difficult it is for the user to decide which is the "right" option. In addition, screen size<br>
often limits the number of buttons. As a general rule, about three buttons of ten or<br>
fewer characters will fit on a small screen. Button names should be simple, concise,<br>
and unambiguous.
</p>
<p>
Capitalize button names like book titles (for example, Connect to Server). Never<br>
capitalize all letters in the name (except for the OK button, which should always be<br>
named OK and never ok, Ok, Okay, okay, OKAY, or any other strange variation).
</p>
<p>
On the Macintosh, ellipses are used after command names when the user needs to<br>
provide additional information to complete the command. An ellipsis after a button<br>
name indicates that the button leads to other dialogs, a rare but occasional occurrence.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE ACTION BUTTON</b>
</p>
<p>
Alert boxes that provide the user with a choice should be worded as a short question to<br>
which there is an unambiguous, affirmative response. The button for this affirmative<br>
response is called the <i>action button</i>.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, label the action button with the action that it performs. Button<br>
names such as Save, Quit, or Erase Disk allow experienced users to click the correct<br>
button without reading the text of a familiar dialog. These labels are often clearer than<br>
words like OK or Yes. Phrase the question to match the action that the user is trying to<br>
perform.
</p>
<p>
If the action can't be condensed conveniently into a word or two, use OK. Also use OK<br>
when the alert is simply giving the user information without providing any choices.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE CANCEL BUTTON</b>
</p>
<p>
Whenever possible, caution alerts should provide a button that allows the user to back<br>
out of the operation that caused the alert. This button should be labeled "Cancel" so that<br>
users can easily identify the safe escape hatch. Cancel means "dismiss this operation<br>
with no side effects"; it doesn't mean "done with the alert," "stop no matter what," or<br>
anything else. Pressing Command-period or the Escape key should have the same effect<br>
as clicking the Cancel button.
</p>
<p>
Don't label the button Cancel when it's impossible to return to the state that existed<br>
before an operation began; instead, use Stop. Stop halts the operation before its normal<br>
completion, accepting the possible side effects. Stop may leave the results of partially<br>
completed tasks around, but Cancel never does. For example, a Cancel button would be<br>
inappropriate for a copy operation in which some of the items may have already been<br>
copied. Figure 1 (earlier in this article) illustrates using Stop in a status dialog for a<br>
copy operation.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE DEFAULT BUTTON</b>
</p>
<p>
The default button represents the action performed when the user presses the Return<br>
or Enter key. This button should perform the most likely action (if that can be<br>
determined). In most cases, this means completing the action that the user started, so<br>
the default button is usually the same as the action button.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The default button's distinctive bold outline</b> appears automatically<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around the default button in alerts, but remember that in dialog boxes you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;need to outline the button yourself.*
</p>
<p>
If the most likely action is dangerous (for example, it erases the hard disk), the<br>
default should be a safe button, typically the Cancel button. If none of the choices are<br>
dangerous and there isn't a likely choice, there should be no default button; by<br>
requiring users to select a button explicitly, you protect them from accidentally<br>
damaging their work by pressing the Return or Enter key out of habit.
</p>
<h2>POP QUIZ</h2>
<p>
Now, for a bit of fun. I've been collecting some alerts that need improvement (Figures<br>
3, 4, and 5). Based on the information in this article, can you find the flaws in each,<br>
and suggest improvements? The main problems with the alert in Figure 3 are as<br>
follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Its title isn't descriptive (and is overly alarming).</li>
<li>The implied subject of the message is the user instead of the application.</li>
<li>The word "caution" is in all uppercase letters, and the punctuation<br>
includes an exclamation point.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img src="img/264.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3. </b>Poorly designed "danger alert"
</p>
<p>
Also, the buttons are slightly shorter than the standard height. Since the audience in<br>
this case is programmers, the words <i>kernel</i> and <i>runtime</i> are acceptable, though the<br>
use of <i>runtime</i> in this context is colloquial and can be more clearly stated with a<br>
simpler word. To improve this alert, you could change the title to "Download" and the<br>
message to "The code you are downloading redefines one or more kernel definitions.<br>
Continuing the download may make the application unusable." Also, the buttons should<br>
be made 20 pixels high.
</p>
<p>
The alert in Figure 4 isn't movable, so it has no title and can't be repositioned. The<br>
message, with its "If . . ." clause, isn't direct and clear enough. Also, it's not clear<br>
which button provides a safe escape mechanism. Finally, the "Work offline" button<br>
title has incorrect capitalization. To improve the alert, you could make it movable and<br>
give it the title "Connect to Server." The message should be "The public calendar<br>
server selected in the Chooser is different from the one you used last. Connecting to the<br>
new server will cause all public event information in your document to be lost." You<br>
could add a Quit button as an escape mechanism, giving the alert three buttons -- Quit,<br>
Connect, and Work Offline (the default).
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/265.gif" width="386 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 4. </b>Poorly designed "server alert"
</p>
<p>
The alert in Figure 5 doesn't contain any title, icon, or buttons. Because there are no<br>
buttons, it's not clear how to get rid of the message without reading to the end of it.<br>
Also, its message should be stated in the present (for example, is named). But the<br>
biggest problem is that this is a nuisance alert: the success of the capture could have<br>
been confirmed in an earlier step, when the user was asked to pick the filename. The<br>
solution is to get rid of the alert altogether.

<h2>THE PAYOFF</h2>
<p>
Spending some time thinking about the design of your application's alerts makes sense<br>
because it results in a better product. If you follow the simple guidelines presented in<br>
this article, your alerts should be in really good shape. Your users will have an easier<br>
time recovering from errors, adding to their positive experience with your software.
