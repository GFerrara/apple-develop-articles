&nbsp;When it comes to the development of Artificial Intelligence systems, scientists tend to<br>
conjecture that man himself, encompassing the brain with its bazillion synapses and<br>
neurons, is the paradigmatic super-computer. "Computer?" you might ask, "Where<br>
are thebits and bytes, the binaries that make it a true computer?"Hold on; disclosure<br>
is only a paragraph away. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;On a recent camping trip, I observed a friend of mine making some strange gestures<br>
with his left hand. When I inquired about this, he asked me whether I could figure out<br>
how his raised middle finger represented a binary 4. After getting over my initial<br>
surprise at the gesture, I began to understand: it was finger-coded binary (FCB). 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;THE BASICS OF FCB</b> The single- and triple-handed excepted, the averagely handed<br>
human being is capable of producing a number range of up to 2^10 by using his or her<br>
fingers. Every finger represents a bit of information:
</p>
<p>
Left hand, thumb (L1): Bit 0, value 1<br>
Left hand, index (L2): Bit 1, value 2<br>
. . . <br>
Left hand, little (L5): Bit 4, value 16<br>
Right hand, little (R1): Bit 5, value 32<br>
. . . <br>
Right hand, middle (R3): Bit 7, value 128<br>
Right hand, index (R4): Bit 8, value 256 or carry flag<br>
Right hand, thumb (R5): Bit 9, value 512 or overflow flag
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;Though I prefer this style (palms facing in), your personal style may vary. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;To set a bit, you only have to raise the respective finger; to clear a bit, bend the<br>
finger. LSL and LSR do the same they did back in Apple II-land ("shift" your fingers<br>
left or right), as do ADD and SUB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To add, look at each bit in the number you're<br>
adding, least significant bit first. If the bit is set, set that same bit in the number<br>
you're adding to. If a bit you're trying to set is already set, clear it and set the next<br>
higher bit instead.) That's all you need for basic mathematics. 
</p>
<pre>Exercise:   (3 + 6)* 2
Solution:   Set L1, L2          --&gt; 3
            Clear L2, set L3    --&gt; + 2
            Clear L3, set L4    --&gt; + 4
            "Shift" fingers right 1 position  --&gt; * 2
Result:     L1 clear, L2 set, L3, L4 clear, L5 set      --&gt; 18</pre>
<p>
Now think up some examples for yourself. Practice hard and daily. Try to outperform<br>
your calculator. Then challenge your old Apple II. Then get really brave and challenge<br>
your Macintosh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do it every week. Do it until you excel Excel. When you've gone that<br>
far, relax. Congratulations, you're a human supercomputer! Now you can go for the<br>
real thing. 
</p>
<p>
<b>CREATING REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS</b><br>
In general, nothing is prohibited. (If you're not sure whether showing the police your<br>
raised middle finger while shouting "I have to raise four children, you @#$%&amp;!" is<br>
legally safe, consult your lawyer.)
</p>
<p>
In particular, here are some useful examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell people your age. They'll envy you for being able to count your age on<br>
one hand (you may need two, but that's still amazing). </li>
<li>Get a kick out of telling your friends your phone number. If you animate<br>
your fingers fast enough, you could even compete with QuickTime. </li>
<li>Earn some extra money. Advertise yourself in any local or national<br>
newspaper as either (a) a human binary calculator, (b) a shadow puppeteer,<br>
or (c) a lunatic. Finger food obligatory. </li>
</ul>
<p>
I'll keep my bits . . . er . . . fingers crossed for you. 
</p>
<p>
Oh, one last thing: If you want to expand your bit range, you might also use your toes<br>
(imagine a gigantic range of 2^20!) or even your ears (if you can wiggle them) or<br>
eyes (unless of course you're driving or are otherwise mobile). Good luck!

in Erlangen, Germany, where he's doing his community service (as an alternative to<br>
military service). When he's not taking care of anything, he's swimming or playing<br>
soccer or badminton, or he's on the road jamming with Rush, Dire Straits, or Bad<br>
Religion. *
