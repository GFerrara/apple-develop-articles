<h1>Macintosh Q &amp; A</h1>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>How do I determine whether a Power Macintosh has PCI expansion slots?</i><br>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;If there's a Name Registry, you can use it to determine whether a PCI bus exists.<br>
To determine whether the Name Registry exists, use the new Gestalt selector<br>
gestaltNameRegistryVersion ('nreg'). If the Name Registry exists, the value returned<br>
is the version number of the Registry; otherwise, gestaltUndefSelectorErr is<br>
returned, and you can assume that the machine doesn't have PCI slots.
</p>
<p>
If the Name Registry exists, call RegistryEntrySearch to look for an entry having a<br>
property name of device_type and a propertyValue of pci. If an entry is found, there is<br>
a PCI bus on the machine.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Our software doesn't awaken properly on a PowerBook that has come out of sleep</i><br>
<i>mode. Are there any special handling requirements to recover from sleep mode?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;The changes to the system state when a PowerBook goes to sleep include the<br>
following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>All AppleTalk connections are lost, because the AppleTalk driver is turned<br>
off.</li>
<li>The serial ports are entirely shut down to conserve power.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are two Macintosh Technical Notes that relate to your situation: "Little<br>
PowerBook in Slumberland" (HW 24), which provides a brief overview of the sleep<br>
process, and "Sleep Queue Tasks" (HW 31), which presents additional material<br>
regarding the sleep process. The second one includes sample code that demonstrates a<br>
sleep queue task implementation. The sleep queue task enables your program to save<br>
state information that otherwise might be lost. Typically, this is important for a<br>
networked process that needs to reestablish a connection upon awakening.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Can we define our own extensions to QuickTime's ImageDescription structure? In</i><br>
<i>other words, can we just attach any kind of data to the end of the ImageDescription</i><br>
<i>structure? Our codec would use this data only on the Macintosh.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;Yes, you can add any extended data you like, with the utility routines provided for<br>
this purpose (described in Inside Macintosh: QuickTime Components, starting on page<br>
4-65). You have complete control over how your codec interprets the extensions.<br>
Therefore, as long as the default image description handle remains intact (for the<br>
benefit of the various Movie Toolbox calls that depend on the documented structure<br>
being there), you can add whatever information you like. Note that Apple reserves all<br>
extension types consisting entirely of lowercase letters.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>We're trying to write a QuickTime codec, but we're having trouble because Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh: QuickTime Components was written before the universal headers, and the</i><br>
<i>sample codec source doesn't build at all with the latest headers. Where can we get a</i><br>
<i>QuickTime codec that builds for PowerPC under the current universal headers?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;Until a PowerPC-native codec example becomes available, you can get the<br>
information you need from the Macintosh Technical Note "Component Manager version<br>
3.0" (QT 5), which provides details on creating native components. Note that you have<br>
to use Resorcerer or Rez to create the component templates; ResEdit won't suffice.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Our codec needs to provide more options to the user than the normal</i><br>
<i>image-compression dialog contains. The documentation suggests that it's possible to</i><br>
<i>provide an extra Options button in the dialog, and I've seen some applications that do</i><br>
<i>provide an Options button for certain codecs. Is this a function of the application? How</i><br>
<i>does the application know to do this?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;If your codec component has an exported function named CDRequestSettings, the<br>
standard image-compression dialog will automatically provide the specific button. In<br>
other words, QuickTime checks the codec component, adds the button (provided it's<br>
available), tracks clicks in the button, and calls your CDRequestSettings routine<br>
appropriately. For further details, see the Macintosh Technical Note "QuickTime 1.6.1<br>
Features" (QT 4) where CDRequestSettings is documented.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>We have a non-Macintosh device that creates and reads QuickTime movies, and we</i><br>
<i>need to pass additional information about the images between the non-Macintosh device</i><br>
<i>and our QuickTime codec. It seems that the logical place to put this information is in an</i><br>
<i>ImageDescription extension (within the sample description atom), since this is about</i><br>
<i>all that's accessible to a codec. Is the format of this extension documented anywhere?</i><br>
<i>We've looked at the extension created by SetImageDescriptionExtension, and the format</i><br>
<i>seems simple, but it would be nice to know what the "official" format is.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;Chapter 4 of Inside Macintosh: QuickTime has a listing of the atoms and their<br>
formats. Sample description atoms are described on page 4-35. Note that each media<br>
format has its own sample description tables, which are not directly accessible.
</p>
<p>
The official guideline is to use, if possible, the provided APIs for creating sample<br>
description atoms. If you're working on a platform for which there are no Toolbox<br>
APIs, you'll have to obtain a source-code license agreement to get real source code<br>
showing how the atoms are constructed. (For details regarding licensing part or all of<br>
the QuickTime source code, contact Apple Software Licensing at AppleLink SW.LICENSE<br>
or (512)919-2645.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Our application plays QuickTime movies. Some older movies played well in System</i><br>
<i>7.1, but they don't play properly in System 7.5 or 7.5.1. We happened to find the</i><br>
<i>Apple Multimedia Tuner, and it solves the problem. What is the Apple Multimedia</i><br>
<i>Tuner, who needs it, how does a customer get it, and can we distribute it?</i></p><p><b>A</b>&nbsp;The
real solution to your problem is just to preroll the movie before playing it, which is<br>
what the Apple Multimedia Tuner is doing for you. QuickTime 2.1 incorporates all the<br>
Tuner improvements, so there's no longer any need to distribute the Tuner separately.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>We have a problem when we draw to an offscreen GWorld under low-memory</i><br>
<i>conditions (when the system heap can't grow) on a Power Macintosh. The GWorld</i><br>
<i>drawn contains digital noise. The same code works just fine in an 680x0 environment.</i><br>
<i>Any idea what's happening?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;It sounds as if the Code Fragment Manager is unable to load the code from the<br>
PowerPlug library into temporary memory. This will cause QuickTime to issue a<br>
noCodecErr error. You should always try to catch QuickTime-generated errors,<br>
checking, for instance, for playback errors after each MoviesTask call like this:
</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<pre>anErr = GetMoviesStatus(Movie theMovie, Track *problemTrack);</pre>
<p>
Here's a possible workaround to your problem: Launch a small application that has the<br>
QuickTimeLib (PowerPlug) library statically linked in, so that it's loaded. This<br>
application should launch the main application and then kill itself. The second<br>
application could try to grow to a predefined size and handle low-memory conditions in<br>
whatever way it wants, but the CFM libraries are already in memory by then.
</p>
<p>
The Code Fragment Manager will never load fragments into an application heap,<br>
because there's a global registry of CFM libraries present. If another application<br>
registers to use a CFM library that's in an application heap that subsequently goes<br>
away, this will obviously be a Bad Thing. In the 680x0 environment, the codecs are<br>
components, and the Component Manager will always try to load components into the<br>
application heap if the system heap doesn't have any available space.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I need to add print items to a QuickDraw GX dialog box. In attempting to use the</i><br>
<i>Experiment no.9 sample, I found what appears to be a bug. This example uses</i><br>
<i>GXGetMessageHandlerResFile when it calls GXSetupDialogPanel, but it should call</i><br>
<i>CurResFile.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;You're right. Applications should call CurResFile. GXGetMessageHandlerResFile is<br>
reserved for extensions and drivers.
</p>
<p>
For additional code examples that add print items to a QuickDraw GX dialog box, see the<br>
Worldwide Developers Conference 1995 Technology CD (or the Mac OS Software<br>
Developer's Kit). The Extension Shell, UserItems, and Additions samples provide the<br>
basic item adding/handling code that you require.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Where can I find some good sample code that demonstrates the techniques required for</i><br>
<i>a "panel" with QuickDraw GX printing (as an application -- not an extension)?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;There are two sample applications ("Experiment no.9" and "Banana Jr.") that<br>
show how to do this. In both of these applications, the panels appear in the Custom Page<br>
Setup dialog. However, the sample code can easily be modified to add panels to the Page<br>
Setup and Print dialogs.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>How can I draw and print hairlines with QuickDraw GX? We use a picture comment in</i><br>
<i>the normal print code, but this seems to make QuickDraw GX fail. We get a -51 error</i><br>
<i>(reference number invalid) when we call GXGetJobError after calling GXFinishJob,</i><br>
<i>and we sometimes get this error without the picture comment code.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>We also tried calling GXSetShapePen in our spool procedure. When we set it to a</i><br>
<i>fractional value, we get a wide line, but when we set it to a wide value, such as 8, it</i><br>
<i>works properly. What do we need to do to print fractional widths?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;Here are two ways to get QuickDraw GX to draw hairlines when printing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Call GXSetShapePen(myShape, 0). This sets your pen width to 0, meaning<br>
as thin as possible on the output device. QuickDraw GX always draws hairlines<br>
at the resolution of the output device -- one pixel wide.</li>
<li>Call GXSetStylePen(myStyle, 0). This also sets your pen width to 0, with<br>
the same result.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When using GXSetShapePen and GXSetStylePen, don't specify the pen width as an<br>
integer: remember that it's a fixed-point value. GXSetStylePen(myStyle, 1) sets the<br>
pen width to 1/65536; GXSetStylePen(myStyle, ff(1)) sets it to 1.0.
</p>
<p>
QuickDraw GX uses a backing store file (an invisible file within the System Folder) to<br>
send QuickDraw GX objects to disk when additional space is needed within the<br>
QuickDraw GX heap. Almost all -51 errors from within QuickDraw GX or an<br>
application using QuickDraw GX are caused by double-disposing of a QuickDraw GX<br>
object (that is, a shape, ink, style, or transform). The -51 error occurs because the<br>
double dispose causes QuickDraw GX to set the shape attributes, which indicates that it<br>
has sent the object to disk. When it needs this object, it goes to the backing store and<br>
tries to get it, but it's not there. We've found a few cases where QuickDraw GX itself<br>
was double-disposing of objects, and these were fixed in QuickDraw GX version 1.1.
</p>
<p>
Before calling GXDrawShape, call GXValidateShape on the shape or shapes you're trying<br>
to print. This ensures that a shape is valid before it's drawn or printed. It slows things<br>
down a little, but you'll be able to determine whether a shape is still available before<br>
you attempt to draw it (you might be disposing of a shape before you draw it). If you<br>
have an error handler installed, you usually receive the "shape_already_disposed"<br>
message, but you may not receive this message if something is wrong with the<br>
QuickDraw GX backing store.
</p>
<p>
It's also possible that the hairline drawing problems you're encountering are related<br>
to the translation options you're using. A translator takes your QuickDraw drawing<br>
commands and converts them to QuickDraw GX objects, based on options you provide. If<br>
you use the gxDefaultOptionsTranslation setting, a QuickDraw line turns into a<br>
six-sided filled polygon. When your object is a polygon, changing the pen width has no<br>
effect.
</p>
<p>
To avoid translation problems, call GXInstallQDTranslator with the<br>
gxSimpleGeometryTranslation or the gxReplaceLineWidthTranslation option.
</p>
<ul>
<li>gxSimpleGeometryTranslation turns on both the simple-lines and<br>
simple-scaling translation options, and it translates QuickDraw lines into<br>
QuickDraw GX lines with flat endcaps. The QuickDraw GX line shape runs along<br>
the center of the original QuickDraw line, and it covers all the pixels of the<br>
QuickDraw line and more.</li>
<li>gxReplaceLineWidthTranslation turns a QuickDraw line into a QuickDraw<br>
GX line with a width that is the average of the original pen's width and height.<br>
This option also affects the way the SetLineWidth picture comment is<br>
interpreted.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once you set the translation option, your calls to GXSetShapePen or GXSetStylePen<br>
should behave as you expect them to, because they're acting on QuickDraw GX lines, not<br>
polygons. When you've installed a translator, be sure to remove it with<br>
GXRemoveQDTranslator. To learn more about the translation options, see Chapter 1 of<br>
Inside Macintosh: QuickDraw GX Environment and Utilities.

<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'm trying to send messages from within a QuickDraw GX message override. I want to</i><br>
<i>send GXWriteData to flush the buffer so that I can send the GXGetDeviceStatus message.</i><br>
<i>I override the GXHandlePanelEvent message. In my override, sending messages causes</i><br>
<i>the system to crash. What would cause this to happen?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;The crash is occurring because there's no connection to the printer at the time<br>
you're sending the message. You have to send the GXOpenConnection, GXWriteData, and<br>
GXCloseConnection messages. Note that when you send GXOpenConnection, QuickDraw GX<br>
puts up the default job status dialog for a short time. If you don't want this dialog to<br>
appear, you can override the GXJobStatus message to prevent it from being shown. See<br>
also Dave Hersey's Print Hints column, "Writing QuickDraw GX Drivers With Custom<br>
I/O and Buffering," in develop Issue 21.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I used the sample driver showing how to do custom dialogs as the basis for the</i><br>
<i>compatibility part of our QuickDraw GX PostScript driver, and I added an Options</i><br>
<i>dialog to it for our printer-specific features. I have two problems with it when using</i><br>
<i>applications that aren't QuickDraw GX-aware. First, the paper-type always defaults to</i><br>
<i>the fifth paper-type listed in the resource file, so whichever paper-type is the fifth</i><br>
<i>one listed becomes the default paper-type in the QuickDraw GX compatibility driver.</i><br>
<i>This is, of course, reflected in the Page Setup dialog. Second, the driver always</i><br>
<i>defaults to having the "Print to File" checkbox on. What can I do about these problems?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;Both the quirks you describe (improper default paper-type and the "Print to File"<br>
checkbox defaulting to on) can be fixed by modifying the 'PREC' 0 resource in the<br>
driver.
</p>
<p>
When an application using old-style printing calls PrintDefault to request the default<br>
print record from the current printer driver, the driver gives it the contents of the<br>
'PREC' 0 resource. Then, when the application calls PrJobDialog or PrStlDialog, it<br>
passes in that print record. In its overrides, the QuickDraw GX printer driver<br>
interprets the contents of the old-style print record to set up the states of the dialog's<br>
buttons, checkboxes, and so on.
</p>
<p>
To determine which paper-type radio button to select in the Page Setup dialog,<br>
QuickDraw GX compares the page rectangle specified in the old-style print record to<br>
the rectangles of all the paper-types in the driver (or paper-type extensions, such as<br>
"3-Hole Punch"), and tries to find the best match. Because of the way that the<br>
old-style print record in the sample is defined, that best match turns out to be the<br>
fifth paper-type in your list. So, to fix this quirk, all you have to do is change the<br>
bounds setting in the 'PREC' 0 resource so that it matches the bounds of the US Letter<br>
paper-type in the driver.
</p>
<p>
To determine the state of the "Print to File" checkbox, the driver looks at the UlOffset<br>
field of the old-style print record. (You might not think to look here, but old-style<br>
print records are limited to 120 bytes, and there was no better place to store this<br>
information.) Because the 'PREC' 0 resource in this driver has this field set to 1, the<br>
checkbox defaults to on. So, to fix this, all you have to do is set the field to 0.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I want to create an extension for the Page Setup/Format dialog that performs</i><br>
<i>"flipping" functions. Is it feasible to create an extension for the Page Setup/Format</i><br>
<i>dialog rather than the Print dialog?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;There's nothing to prevent you from creating an extension that adds a panel to the<br>
Page Setup dialog. Most printing extensions add to the Print dialog because in most<br>
cases this is the proper place to add a panel that affects the entire output, and because<br>
what extensions usually do is best suited for the Print dialog. Drivers and<br>
applications, on the other hand, typically add to the Format dialog. Note that if you're<br>
trying to modify an existing sample extension so that it adds to the Page Setup dialog,<br>
you have a bit of work to do.
</p>
<p>
There's a way that you can test your flipping code without writing a new extension, by<br>
the way. Applications can override the GXJobDefaultFormatDialog or GXFormatDialog<br>
message. There are two examples ("Experiment no.9" and "Banana Jr.") that<br>
demonstrate overriding GXFormatDialog. You might try adding your flipping code to one<br>
of these.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>A car passed me the other day with one of those round white country stickers that said</i><br>
<i>WAL. Where was it from?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;Sierra Leone.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>In QuickDraw 3D, when we have the interactive renderer on and we try to turn off</i><br>
<i>the draw context's clearImageMethod (setting it to kQ3ClearMethodNone), it still</i><br>
<i>clears. This works properly with the wireframe renderer, but we need this feature in</i><br>
<i>the interactive renderer, since we're pasting in background pictures that we want to</i><br>
<i>act as a backdrop to our 3D models. The interactive renderer always obliterates the</i><br>
<i>background with the clearImageColor. What can we do?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;Unfortunately, this is a renderer-dependent feature that's supported by the<br>
wireframe renderer, but not the interactive renderer. We intend to provide a "Clear<br>
with picture" method in the next major release of QuickDraw 3D (version 1.1).
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>The interactive renderer doesn't draw flat surfaces that are parallel to the camera</i><br>
<i>view direction with the orthographic camera, but the wireframe renderer does. We</i><br>
<i>put in a "floor" of polygons, and when we look along the edge of the floor with the</i><br>
<i>orthographic camera, it totally disappears. With the wireframe renderer, we see a</i><br>
<i>line where the floor is, which is as expected. What gives?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;Filled primitives have no thickness, so when you look at them edge-on, they do not<br>
appear. Lines, however, are a mathematical abstraction, so they always appear to be<br>
one pixel thick (when you zoom in on a line, its thickness doesn't increase). While this<br>
may seem somewhat odd, it's the way many libraries work. To achieve the effect you<br>
want, make the floor a thin box, and texture-shade the top surface. If the depth of the<br>
box is nonzero, it appears to be a slab-like structure, and it won't disappear when<br>
viewed edge-on.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>If we iterate through the vertices in a mesh, will the vertices still be in the same</i><br>
<i>order as they were when they were added?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;Yes. The ordering of the vertices doesn't change until you duplicate the mesh or<br>
write it out. A duplicated mesh (or one that was written out and read back in) doesn't<br>
necessarily have the vertices in the same order as when they were added.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>When I try to render models with different types of lights, the point light and the</i><br>
<i>directional light work correctly, but the spot light doesn't. Any idea why?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;The spot light's cone of light needs to touch a number of vertices for any effect to<br>
be seen. If the light is attenuated, it may have insufficient intensity when it strikes the<br>
surface. The cone of light also needs to be wide enough to cover a significant area of the<br>
object being modeled for the renderer to draw a reasonable effect.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>What effect does the TQ3ViewObject parameter have in the bounding box calculating</i><br>
<i>routines (Q3View_StartBoundingBox and Q3View_EndBoundingBox)? The old</i><br>
<i>geometric-object routine descriptions refer to world space, but if this is so, there's</i><br>
<i>no need for a view parameter. However, if the view's camera is used, the bounding box</i><br>
<i>is returned in camera coordinates rather than view coordinates. Since both are useful,</i><br>
<i>would it be possible to have both sets of routines available? I can apply a</i><br>
<i>rotation/translation matrix to all of the items to be drawn to generate camera</i><br>
<i>coordinates from a world coordinate routine, but I need to find out if I need to do this or</i><br>
<i>if this has already been accomplished.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;The QuickDraw 3D routines return the bounding box or bounding sphere in local<br>
coordinates. Part of the reason that the API was modified to use submit calls, rather<br>
than having separate picking, rendering, and writing calls, is that the transformations<br>
that are applied matter more than the camera. Since these modifications were made,<br>
the submit calls for everything (including transformations, if they're not stored in<br>
the group) can be in one submission function that's called from inside the picking,<br>
rendering, or writing loop. If you need the bounding box for a single geometry in its<br>
own coordinate space, this is also easy to do -- you can write a simple routine that<br>
performs bounds calculations on a single object. For example:
</p>
<pre>Q3View_StartBoundingBox;
Q3xxx_Submit;
Q3View_EndBoundingBox;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Does QuickDraw 3D prefer meshes or NURB patches? Which kind of data yields</i><br>
<i>better performance?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;Meshes are convenient for editing, but they take quite a bit of memory, so the<br>
tradeoff is time versus space. NURB patches are more convenient for dealing with<br>
surfaces as a whole and for representing surfaces at different tessellations.
</p>
<p>
Although meshes exhibit better performance than NURB patches in the first version of<br>
QuickDraw 3D, later versions may have improved patch performance. In the<br>
meantime, consider experimenting with the tessellation factor for your patches, since<br>
overtessellating reduces performance.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'd like to make sure that I'm running under version 1.0.2 of QuickDraw 3D. When I</i><br>
<i>get the version from Q3GetVersion the major version is 1 and the minor version is 0,</i><br>
<i>but I can't get the revision (the third number). Is there a Gestalt selector for this?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;Starting with version 1.0.2, there is a Gestalt selector to get the version of<br>
QuickDraw 3D: gestaltQD3DVersion. The return value has two bytes for the major<br>
version, a byte for the minor version, and a byte for the revision. So for version 1.0.2<br>
Gestalt will return 0x00010002. Note that this Gestalt selector works only with<br>
QuickDraw 3D 1.0.2 and later.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>The ColorSync documentation (in the reference section of Inside Macintosh: Advanced</i><br>
<i>Color Imaging) states that each color component in the L*a*b* color space is within</i><br>
<i>the range of 0 to 65,280. Shouldn't this be 0 to 65,535, since this is the value for the</i><br>
<i>other spaces and the value in the ICC Profile Format Specification?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;No. The correct maximum value for this particular color space is 65,280<br>
(0xFF00). Note that the final documentation is now available as Advanced Color<br>
Imaging on the Mac OS, published by Addison-Wesley.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>What exactly are the internal parameters for the ColorSync quality settings?</i><i>That is,</i><br>
<i>how large a lookup table is built for "draft" versus "normal" versus "best"?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;The quality flag bits provide a place in the profile for an application to indicate the<br>
desired quality of a color match (potentially at the expense of speed and memory). In<br>
ColorSync 2.0, these bits do not mandate the use of one algorithm over another, or one<br>
lookup table size over another; they're just recommendations that a particular CMM<br>
may choose to ignore.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at how the default Apple CMM uses the quality recommendations specified in<br>
the flag bits. Other CMMs, of course, will have different implementations.
</p>
<p>
When Apple's CMM builds a color world from two or more profiles, and one or more of<br>
these profiles contain TRC curves or A2Bx tables, the CMM also builds a private,<br>
multidimensional lookup table. The quality flag bits determine the resolution of this<br>
private table. Draft quality is treated the same as Normal quality, so there are really<br>
only two effective settings, Normal/Draft and Best. In most cases, the quality is only<br>
slightly better in Best mode, so the difference is difficult to see, unless one of the<br>
profiles has a high gamma value. For high gamma values, the extra resolution in the<br>
lookup table is helpful.
</p>
<p>
Best mode typically takes twice as long to build a color world (about two seconds,<br>
versus one second in Normal/Draft mode). However, once the color world is built, the<br>
time to use it is the same for either mode (approximately 1.5 MB/second on a Power<br>
Macintosh 8100/110).
</p>
<p>
Best mode also requires significantly more memory than Normal/Draft mode. A color<br>
world typically requires 120K of heap space in Best mode versus 25K in Normal<br>
mode, and the "high-water" memory requirement while a color world is being built is<br>
typically 300K for Best mode versus 90K for Normal mode.
</p>
<p>
Note again that these guidelines apply only to the default Apple CMM. The tradeoffs<br>
between speed, quality, and resources may be quite different for other CMMs.
</p>

<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I want to go directly from an input CMYK space to an output CMYK space (without</i><br>
<i>going through an intermediate three-component space) to preserve the original</i><br>
<i>GCR/UCR settings. Can I create a "link" profile for this purpose? If I do, will I have to</i><br>
<i>write my own CMM to use it?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;You can build a CMYK-to-CMYK device-link profile for this purpose, and you can<br>
use it without writing your own CMM.

<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'm using the ColorSync call CWCheckBitMap to do gamut checking in a plug-in for</i><br>
<i>Photoshop. The result bitmap is not what I expected, and seems to be different every</i><br>
<i>time I try it. Any idea what could be going on?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;CWCheckBitMap sets each pixel in the result bitmap to black if the corresponding<br>
pixel in the source bitmap is out of the gamut. It doesn't, however, set each pixel in the<br>
result bitmap to white if the pixel in the source bitmap is in the gamut. If you aren't<br>
erasing the bitmap before calling CWCheckBitMap, that would explain what you're<br>
seeing. Always erase the result bitmap to white before calling CWCheckBitMap. (This<br>
is also true of CWCheckPixMap and CWCheckColors.)

<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>If I have a physical drive ID, how can I determine whether that drive is a network</i><br>
<i>volume? I'm not sure where to look, and I need to know whether the information is</i><br>
<i>dependable and not subject to change.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;Under the current Macintosh file system, there's no completely dependable way to<br>
determine whether a volume originates over a network or is implemented on a local<br>
disk. This is the result of the way external file systems are implemented -- a third<br>
party can build a network file system in a variety of ways.
</p>
<p>
You can, however, easily determine whether a volume uses the AFP (AppleShare) file<br>
system, which in many cases is adequate. To make this determination, compare the<br>
driver refNum in the drive queue entry to the AppleShare client's refNum.
</p>
<p>
The following code enumerates the drive queue and displays the relevant information:
</p>
<pre>main()
{
   QHdrPtr      drvQHdr = GetDrvQHdr();
   DrvQElPtr   dqeP;
   short         afpRefNum = 0;
   OSErr         errNo;

   // Get the driver refNum for AFP.
   errNo = OpenDriver("\p.AFPTranslator", &amp;afpRefNum);
   if (errNo != noErr)
      return

   // Scan each drive in the drive table.
   dqeP = (DrvQElPtr) drvQHdr-&gt;qHead;
   do {
      // Is it an AFP volume or SCSI device?
      if (dqeP-&gt;dQRefNum == afpRefNum) printf("AFP");
   } while (dqeP =(DrvQElPtr) dqeP-&gt;qLink);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
For other third-party file systems, such as DECNET and NFS, you have to determine<br>
the name of the driver and then compare it to the AppleShare client's refNum.

<b>Q</b>&nbsp;I need to get a list of files in a particular directory. Should I use PBCatSearch, or<br>
should I use indexed PBGetCatInfo or PBGetFInfo requests?
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;The "Cat" in PBCatSearch stands for "Catalog" and that's what PBCatSearch<br>
searches: the whole volume catalog. You can specify that matches found by PBCatSearch<br>
be limited to a specific directory by setting the fsSBFlParID bit in the ioSearchBits<br>
field of the parameter block, and then specify the directory to match on by setting<br>
ioFlParID in ioSearchInfo1 and ioSearchInfo2 to the directory ID you're interested in.<br>
However, PBCatSearch may not be what you want to use, for a couple of reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The matches PBCatSearch finds by matching based on ioFlParID are only<br>
in that one directory, not in any of that directory's subdirectories.</li>
<li>Because the whole catalog file is searched, this is usually not the fastest<br>
way to look through a specific directory's contents.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you need matches in both the directory and its subdirectories and you don't want to<br>
search the whole volume, there's a routine in the MoreFiles sample code named<br>
IndexedSearch that's compatible with PBCatSearch's parameter blocks, except that<br>
IndexedSearch lets you specify what directory you want to search. It uses indexed<br>
PBGetCatInfo calls to search a directory and its subdirectories.
</p>
<p>
If you need matches from only a single directory (and not from that directory's<br>
subdirectories), you can use the MoreFiles routine named GetDirItems. This routine<br>
uses PBGetCatInfo to index through a directory's entries and returns FSSpecs to the<br>
entries found. In this case, making indexed PBGetCatInfo calls is much faster than<br>
searching the whole catalog with PBCatSearch.

<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I need to nest two CustomGetFile dialogs, but I'm running into trouble. Under some</i><br>
<i>circumstances after the user dismisses the second dialog (usually via the Cancel</i><br>
<i>button), I lose all of the custom controls in the first dialog. What's happening?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;The Standard File Package is not reentrant, so there really isn't a way to nest<br>
standard file dialogs that will work right. The real problem is in the resources that the<br>
Standard File Package uses for the dialog items. When the second, nested dialog closes,<br>
it releases resources that the first dialog is still using; that's why your items are<br>
getting messed up.
</p>
<p>
There's a kludgy workaround, but it will break under future systems. You could,<br>
however, use sequential calls to the Standard File Package instead of nesting them. This<br>
is a bit of a pain, but should accomplish what you want. Here's how: Put up the first<br>
dialog. In your filter routine, when the user clicks the control that is to bring up the<br>
nested dialog, set a flag in your application signifying "bring up other," and tell the<br>
Standard File Package that you're done with the first dialog by passing item 1 or 2<br>
back. After you put up the second dialog and process it, bring the original dialog back.<br>
This will be a little messy cosmetically as the dialogs open and close, but it's the only<br>
way to do it in a manner that will remain compatible.

<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>What's the best way to remove an attached leech?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;The best way we know of is to rub a freshly cut lemon or lime on it. Most leeches<br>
will detach immediately, and die a writhing, horrible death shortly afterward. Fire<br>
and salt are also said to be effective.
