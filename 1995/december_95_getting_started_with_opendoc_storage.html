<h1>Getting Started With OpenDoc Storage</h1>
<h2>Vincent Lo</h2>

<p>
<i>OpenDoc's structured storage model is an innovative departure from the traditional</i><br>
<i>storage scheme. As you make the move into OpenDoc development, you need to</i><br>
<i>understand the new storage model and its implications for the way data is stored and</i><br>
<i>retrieved. This article introduces the new concepts and policies you'll need to know in</i><br>
<i>order to use OpenDoc storage effectively.</i>
</p>
<p>
In the traditional Macintosh user model, each application creates and maintains its own<br>
documents, storing each document in a separate file. A file has one creator signature<br>
and one file type, identifying the application it belongs to and the kind of document it<br>
contains. In OpenDoc, by contrast, a document can have multiple parts, created and<br>
maintained by different part editors (called part handlers in earlier versions of<br>
OpenDoc), which are analogous to the standalone applications of the traditional model.<br>
Because all of a document's parts are stored together in the same container (usually<br>
corresponding to a file), there has to be a way for separate part editors to share access<br>
to the same container without interfering with each other.
</p>
<p>
OpenDoc meets this need by providing a structured model for persistent storage (that<br>
is, for storing data from one session to the next). Each part is given its own storage<br>
unit in which to store and retrieve data. The part can thus operate as a standalone<br>
entity, independent of other parts and their storage. OpenDoc maintains all of the<br>
storage units and notifies each part when to read or write its data.
</p>
<p>
The same techniques that are used in dealing with persistent storage also apply to the<br>
various forms of data interchange between part editors, such as the Clipboard, drag<br>
and drop, and linking. Because all of these mechanisms use the same data storage<br>
medium (the storage unit), they all work essentially the same way from the part<br>
editor's point of view. For example, a part uses the same API calls to copy data to the<br>
Clipboard that it would use in writing the data to a file container. The same is true for<br>
drag and drop and for linking. Thus, once you learn how to work with OpenDoc storage<br>
units for file storage, you can use the same techniques to implement data interchange<br>
as well.
</p>
<p>
This article assumes that you're already familiar with basic OpenDoc concepts and<br>
terminology. If you need a quick introduction or refresher, see the article "The<br>
OpenDoc User Experience" in <i>develop</i> Issue 22. You can find additional information on<br>
some of OpenDoc's technical basics in the articles "Building an OpenDoc Part Handler"<br>
in Issue 19 and "Getting Started With OpenDoc Graphics" in Issue 21. Developer<br>
releases of OpenDoc include the definitive documentation, the <i>OpenDoc Programmer's</i><br>
<i>Guide</i> and <i>OpenDoc Class Reference</i>. Developer releases are available through a number<br>
of different sources, or you can request the latest release at AppleLink OPENDOC or at<br>
opendoc@applelink.apple.com on the Internet. The source code in this article is<br>
excerpted from a sample part included with the developer release.
</p>
<p>
Because OpenDoc was developed jointly by a consortium of companies including Apple,<br>
IBM, and Novell, its interfaces are designed for cross-platform compatibility, using<br>
IBM's platform-independent Standard Object Model (SOM). OpenDoc method<br>
definitions, including the ones in this article, are commonly written in a<br>
language-neutral Interface Definition Language (IDL). The SOM compiler converts<br>
these into equivalent language-specific declarations for whatever source language you<br>
happen to be using. The method definitions shown in this article, for instance, are<br>
taken from the OpenDoc interface file StorageU.idl. To use these methods in your<br>
program, you must include the corresponding language-specific <i>binding file</i> (such as<br>
StorageU.xh for a C++ program).
</p>
<h2>DRAFTS, DOCUMENTS, AND CONTAINERS</h2>
<p>
The OpenDoc classes responsible for providing storage capabilities are ODContainer,<br>
ODDocument, ODDraft, and ODStorageUnit. Collectively, a set of subclasses derived<br>
from these four is known as a <i>container suite.</i> A <i>container</i>represents the physical<br>
storage medium in which a document is stored, such as a disk file. Different container<br>
suites share the same API, but may use different low-level storage mechanisms and<br>
operate on different physical storage media. For example, the Bento container suite,<br>
which will be shipped with OpenDoc 1.0, supports both file containers and in-memory<br>
containers. A part editor can thus use the same code to store a part's data either to a<br>
file or in memory.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A single container may contain one or more documents, each of which in turn can<br>
include one or more <i>drafts</i>. A part ordinarily works with a draft, rather than directly<br>
with a document or its container. Each draft is a "snapshot" representing the state of<br>
the document at a particular point in its development. Together, the drafts embody the<br>
history of the document over time.
</p>
<p>
A part may need to interact with its draft for a variety of reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent objects -- Every persistent object (such as a part, a frame,<br>
or a link) is created by a draft.</li>
<li>Data interchange -- A part asks its draft to copy transferred objects to<br>
and from a data-interchange container, such as the Clipboard or a<br>
drag-and-drop container.</li>
<li>Linking -- A part uses its draft to create link specifications and copy data<br>
to and from link objects.</li>
<li>Permissions -- A part may need to find out whether it's allowed to write<br>
to the draft.</li>
<li>Scripting -- A part gets its scripting-specific identifier through its<br>
draft.</li>
</ul>
<h2>STORAGE UNITS</h2>
<p>
The basic entity of a container suite is the storage unit. Every persistent OpenDoc<br>
object has a storage unit in which to store and retrieve its data. Figure 1 shows a<br>
typical example.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/248.gif" width="309 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1. Structure of a storage unit</b>
</p>
<p>
A storage unit consists of one or more properties, each of which in turn is associated<br>
with one or more values containing the data itself. The storage unit shown in Figure 1,<br>
for instance, has properties named kODPropContents, kODPropPreferredKind, and<br>
kODPropDisplayFrames; the kODPropContents property has values of types<br>
kTextEditorKind and kODMacIText.
</p>
<p>
Using multiple values allows a property to represent the same data in different forms.<br>
For example, a property holding a drawing may have three values representing the<br>
same data: one as a Macintosh PICT, one as a Windows metafile, and one in TIFF format.<br>
Although OpenDoc cannot enforce the principle, part developers are urged to use<br>
multiple values within a property only for multiple representations of the same data,<br>
not for storing unrelated data items.
</p>
<p>
The property names and value types shown in Figure 1 represent string constants of<br>
type ODPropertyName and ODValueType, respectively. For cross-platform<br>
extensibility, both of these types are defined as equivalent to an ISO string instead of a<br>
traditional Macintosh OSType: that is, they're 7-bit ASCII null-terminated strings, as<br>
specified by the International Standards Organization (ISO). The string values<br>
themselves are expected to follow a standard naming convention: for instance, the<br>
constants kODPropDisplayFrames and kODWeakStorageUnitRefs stand for the strings<br>
"OpenDoc:Property:DisplayFrames" and "OpenDoc:Type:StorageUnitRefs",<br>
respectively. The OpenDoc interface files StdProps.idl and StdTypes.idl define name<br>
constants for standard properties and value types; any property and type names that<br>
you define for yourself should follow the same naming conventions.
</p>
<p>
<b>FOCUSING A STORAGE UNIT</b>
</p>
<p>
The OpenDoc operations for manipulating values don't explicitly identify the value to<br>
operate on. Instead, you have to focus the storage unit on the desired property or value<br>
before invoking the operation. The method for setting the focus is defined in class<br>
ODStorageUnit as follows:
</p>
<pre>ODStorageUnit Focus(in ODPropertyName propertyName,
                     in ODPositionCode propertyPosCode,
                     in ODValueType valueType,
                     in ODValueIndex valueIndex,
                     in ODPositionCode valuePosCode);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This allows you to set the storage unit's focus in a variety of ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>to a property by name</li>
<li>to a property by position relative to the current property</li>
<li>to a value by type within a property</li>
<li>to a value by position within a property</li>
<li>to a value by position relative to the current value</li>
</ul>
<p>
Properties and values are ordered within the storage unit according to the sequence in<br>
which they were added. Values within a property are indexed from 1: that is, the first<br>
value has index 1, the second index 2, and so on. Positions relative to the current focus<br>
are specified with a position code. The same position code can refer to either a<br>
property or a value, depending on the current focus. For instance, if the storage unit is<br>
currently focused on a property, the position code kODPosNextSib designates the next<br>
property; if the current focus is on a value, kODPosNextSib designates the next value.
</p>
<p>
Another way to set the focus of a storage unit is with a storage unit cursor:
</p>
<pre>ODStorageUnit FocusWithCursor(in ODStorageUnitCursor cursor);</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The cursor identifies a property by name or a value by its property name and its index<br>
or value type. Once created (with method CreateCursor or CreateCursorWithFocus of<br>
class ODStorageUnit), the same cursor can be reused multiple times to refer to<br>
properties or values within the storage unit.
</p>
<p>
Once you've focused a storage unit, you can create a <i>storage unit view</i> to refer to the<br>
same property or value again later without having to reset the focus:
</p>
<pre>ODStorageUnitView CreateView();</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The view responds to all the same access methods as the storage unit itself, but applies<br>
them to the property or value that had the focus at the time the view was created,<br>
rather than at the time the method is invoked. It does this by automatically resetting<br>
the underlying storage unit to the original focus, then forwarding the method call to<br>
the storage unit for processing.
</p>
<p>
<b>MANIPULATING VALUE DATA</b>
</p>
<p>
The operations for manipulating data within a storage value are stream-based, very<br>
much like reading or writing to a sequential file. Each value has a current offset<br>
position that controls where the next operation will take place, similar to the file<br>
mark in the Macintosh file system. In addition to reading and writing data sequentially,<br>
you can also insert or delete data at the current offset position.
</p>
<p>
Class ODStorageUnit defines the following methods for manipulating value data:
</p>
<pre>void SetOffset(in ODULong offset);
ODULong GetOffset();
void SetValue(in ODByteArray value);
ODULong GetValue(in ODULong length, out ODByteArray value);
void InsertValue(in ODByteArray value);
void DeleteValue(in ODULong length);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The ODByteArray structure is used to pass data to or from a storage unit.
</p>
<pre>typdef struct {
   unsigned long  _maximum; /* size of buffer */
   unsigned long  _length;  /* number of bytes of actual data */
   octet*         _buffer;  /* pointer to buffer containing the */
                            /* data */
} _IDL_SEQUENCE_octet;

typedef _IDL_SEQUENCE_octet ODByteArray;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
(An<b>octet</b> is simply the SOM term for an 8-bit byte.) Listing 1 shows how to<br>
manipulate one of the values shown in Figure 1.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1. </b>Adding data to a value
</p>
<pre>/* Focus the storage unit, using property name and value type. */
storageUnit-&gt;Focus(ev, kODPropContents, kODPosUndefined,
                  kTextEditorKind, 0, kODPosUndefined);

/* Set up the byte array. */
ODByteArray ba;
ba._length = size;
ba._maximum = size;
ba._buffer = buffer;

/* Set the offset. (This step isn't really needed here, since the
   Focus operation automatically sets the offset to 0. It's included
   for illustrative purposes only.) */
storageUnit-&gt;SetOffset(ev, 0);

/* Add the value. */
storageUnit-&gt;SetValue(ev, &amp;ba);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>STORAGE UNIT REFERENCES</b>
</p>
<p>
Storage unit references allow one storage unit to refer persistently to another. A part<br>
can use this mechanism to access information stored in a storage unit (which may or<br>
may not belong to it) across multiple sessions. A draft thus consists essentially of a<br>
network of storage units connected to each other with persistent references.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When a storage unit is cloned (copied to a data-interchange container), any other<br>
storage units it references are cloned along with it. Since all storage units in a draft<br>
are interconnected, cloning any one of them may cause the whole draft to be cloned.<br>
Because this may be an expensive and unnecessary operation, OpenDoc provides two<br>
levels of storage unit reference: strong and weak. Only strongly referenced storage<br>
units are copied when the unit that refers to them is cloned.
</p>
<p>
In Figure 2, frame A refers strongly to part A, which refers strongly to frame B,<br>
which refers strongly to part B. Thus if frame A's storage unit is cloned, all four<br>
storage units will be copied. On the other hand, cloning frame B's storage unit will<br>
copy those for frame B and part B only, since frame B's reference to frame A is weak<br>
rather than strong.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/249.gif" width="239 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2. </b>Strong and weak storage unit references
</p>
<p>
An object can use strong storage unit references to refer to other objects that are<br>
essential to its functioning, such as embedded frames. Weak references are mainly for<br>
informational or secondary purposes: a part might use them, for instance, to refer to<br>
its display frames.
</p>
<h2>LIFE CYCLE OF A PART</h2>
<p>
Figure 3 shows the life cycle of a part and its associated storage unit. Because the<br>
part's lifetime may span multiple editing sessions, it must be able to <i>externalize</i> its<br>
internal state (save it to persistent storage) in order to reconstruct itself from one<br>
session to the next. The part's InitPart method, called when the part is first created,<br>
receives a storage unit as a parameter. The Externalize method can then use this<br>
storage unit to save the part's state. Once externalized, the part can be released from<br>
memory and later reconstituted from external storage by a method named<br>
InitPartFromStorage. Unlike InitPart, InitPartFromStorage can be called multiple<br>
times during a part's lifetime, whenever the part needs to be reconstructed from<br>
external storage.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/250.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3. </b>Life cycle of a part
</p>
<p>
Notice that externalizing a part is not the same as cloning it. Externalizing means<br>
writing the part's data to persistent storage, using a storage unit associated with the<br>
draft in which the part resides; cloning is transferring the part's data to a<br>
data-interchange container such as the Clipboard, using a storage unit associated with<br>
the container. Although the two operations are different, they're both based on the<br>
same ODStorageUnit API and can share much of the same code.
</p>
<p>
Another related operation is <i>purging</i>, which reclaims memory space by eliminating<br>
unnecessary runtime data structures such as caches. Because such structures can<br>
usually be reconstructed from persistent data, many OpenDoc programmers believe<br>
that a part's Purge method should always begin by externalizing the part's data before<br>
deleting unused or unnecessary memory. While this might sound plausible in<br>
principle, the externalization operation itself requires additional memory -- the very<br>
thing that's in short supply during purging. As a general rule, the Purge method should<br>
avoid invoking externalization unless it's absolutely necessary.
</p>
<p>
All persistent objects carry a reference count, enabling OpenDoc to identify unused<br>
objects and reclaim the memory they occupy. The Acquire method, which creates a<br>
reference to a specified object, increments the object's reference count; the Release<br>
method destroys a reference and decrements the reference count. When the reference<br>
count goes down to 0, OpenDoc can safely delete the object from memory.
</p>
<p>
<b>INITIALIZATION</b>
</p>
<p>
The initialization method InitPart is called only once, to set up a part's initial state. It<br>
should take the following actions:
</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Call the parent class's InitPart method to perform any initialization<br>
required at the parent level.</li>


<li>Save the incoming part wrapper object (discussed below) in an internal<br>
field.</li>


<li>Set up an internal permissions field to indicate that writing to the draft is<br>
allowed.</li>


<li>Set up the part's runtime data structures.</li>


<li>Set the part's internal dirty flag to true.</li></ol>
</p>
<p>
Listing 2 shows an example. Notice that the SOM compiler, in translating the method<br>
declaration from language-independent IDL into a specific source language, adds two<br>
additional parameters at the beginning of the parameter list: a pointer to the object<br>
executing the method (somSelf) and an environment pointer (ev) used for error<br>
reporting. All of our example method definitions in this article begin with these two<br>
parameters.
</p>
<p>

      // Set a flag showing that this draft is not read-only.
      _fReadOnlyStorage = kODFalse;
     
      // Call common initialization code to set up our initial state.
      somSelf-&gt;Initialize(ev);
     
      // Set the dirty flag to true.

      // the destructor, which is called automatically when an error
      // is thrown.
  
   SOM_ENDTRY
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Parent initialization.</b> It's important for a part's initialization method to call that<br>
of its parent class. The parent's initialization method will in turn call that of its<br>
parent and so on up the inheritance chain, ensuring that all of the part's inherited<br>
properties are properly initialized. Inherited properties set up by ODPart and its<br>
parents, such as ODPersistentObject, include the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>kODPropCreateDate contains the part's creation date.</li>
<li>kODPropModDate tells when the part's storage unit was last externalized.</li>
<li>kODPropModUser contains the name of the last user who modified the<br>
part.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Part wrapper. </b>Every part is <i>wrapped</i> by another object, called its <i>part</i><br>
<i>wrapper.</i>Clients of the part object deal with it indirectly, through the part wrapper,<br>
instead of holding a direct pointer to the part object itself. The part wrapper receives<br>
all method invocations and delegates them to the actual part. This insulation of the part<br>
object allows the part editor to be changed at run time without affecting its clients.
</p>
<p>
The InitPart method should save the part wrapper object in an internal field. Then,<br>
whenever the part needs to pass an object representing itself as a parameter, it should<br>
pass the part wrapper in place of itself.
</p>
<p>
<b>Draft permissions. </b>A part editor needs to know whether a part is in a read-only<br>
draft. If so, its functionality may be restricted: for example, the part may not allow<br>
the user to change its contents, either through keyboard input or through menu<br>
operations such as Cut and Paste. Also, if the draft is read-only, its Externalize method<br>
need never be called on its parts or any persistent objects. When a part is created for<br>
the first time, its draft is guaranteed to be writable, so it should initialize its<br>
read-only flag to false.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dirty flag.</b> The purpose of a dirty flag is to let the part's Externalize method know<br>
whether it needs to write out the part's state to external storage. Externalization<br>
(especially to disk) can be a time-consuming and expensive operation; using a dirty<br>
flag can greatly improve performance by avoiding it whenever possible.
</p>
<p>
When a part is first created, its storage unit is empty. Since the state has not yet been<br>
written out, the part should initialize its dirty flag to true; the flag should also be set<br>
to true whenever the contents of the part are changed. After saving the state and<br>
content data to external storage, the Externalize method should clear the flag to false,<br>
indicating that the state need not be saved again unless the part's contents are changed.
</p>
<p>
<b>EXTERNALIZATION</b>
</p>
<p>
A part's Externalize method can be called at any time. Typically, it's called by the draft<br>
when the user chooses to save the document. Since a part has no idea when this may<br>
happen, it should always be ready to externalize itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Externalize method should<br>
do the following:
</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Call the parent class's Externalize method.</li>


<li>Check that all required properties exist; if not, add them to the storage unit.</li>

<p class="spacer">&nbsp;

<li>Clean up the part's contents if necessary.</li>


<li>Write out the part's state information and contents.</li>


<li>Clear the part's internal dirty flag to false.</li></ol>
</p>
<p>

      // Clear dirty flag.
      _fDirty = kODFalse;
   }
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The contents of a part must be written out to a special content property named<br>
kODPropContents. Like other properties, the content property can contain multiple<br>
values representing the same data in different forms. A value type used for content data<br>
is referred to as a part kind. To facilitate data interchange, part editors are encouraged<br>
to include one or more standard part kinds in their content property, much the way<br>
traditional Macintosh applications use common data formats like 'TEXT' or 'PICT' when<br>
writing to the Clipboard.
</p>
<p>
Each value in the content property should be a complete representation of the content<br>
data. A value may contain references to other storage units, but cannot depend on other<br>
values in the content property or on other properties in the part's storage unit. Even<br>
if every other property and value were deleted from the storage unit, the part editor<br>
should still be able to reconstruct the part using just that one content value.
</p>
<p>
The ordering of values within the content property is completely determined by the<br>
part editor. An important principle, however, is that values that represent the<br>
underlying contents with greater fidelity should precede those of lesser fidelity:<br>
formatted text, for instance, should precede plain (unformatted) text. The first value<br>
should be the one that represents the content most faithfully.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>When a part editor reconstructs a part</b> from an external storage unit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there's a chance that the storage unit may have originally been written by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some other part editor. As a result, the content property may contain part<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kinds that the current part editor doesn't support, or the values may appear in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wrong fidelity order. In this case, the part's Externalize method should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove all existing values from the content property so that it can write out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its own content data in proper fidelity order.*
</p>
<p>
A standard property named kODPropPreferredKind identifies the part kind that the<br>
user chooses to represent the data. If this property already exists, the part editor<br>
shouldn't tamper with it; if it doesn't exist, the part editor may create it and give it a<br>
value of type kODISOStr containing the name of the highest-fidelity part kind. When<br>
writing out the content data, the part editor should be sure to include a value in the<br>
format specified by this property.
</p>
<p>
<b>RECONSTRUCTION</b>
</p>
<p>
The InitPartFromStorage method is called whenever a part object needs to be<br>
reconstructed from external storage. This method should do the following:
</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Call the parent class's InitPartFromStorage method.</li>


<li>Save the incoming part wrapper object in an internal field.</li>


<li>Set up an internal permissions field to indicate whether writing to the draft<br>
is allowed.</li>


<li>Set up the part's runtime data structures.</li>


<li>Read the content data from the storage unit into the runtime data structures.</li>

<p class="spacer">&nbsp;

<li>Clear the part's internal dirty flag to false.</li></ol>
</p>
<p>
Notice that these are essentially the same steps we listed earlier for the InitPart<br>
method, except that the contents of the part's runtime data structures are read in from<br>
the storage unit instead of being initialized to standard values, and that the dirty flag is<br>
cleared to false instead of true to show that the part's contents agree with those in the<br>
external storage unit. Listing 4 shows an example of an InitPartFromStorage method.

As we've already noted, the storage unit from which a part is reconstructed may have<br>
been created by a part editor other than the one reading it in. The OpenDoc binding<br>
subsystem uses the part kinds found in the storage unit's content property to<br>
determine which part editor to invoke. If the original part editor cannot be found, the<br>
binding subsystem will look for another editor capable of reading the available part<br>
kinds. The contents of the storage unit may thus be very different from what the<br>
current part editor expects. Here are a few points to note:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the storage unit identifies a preferred part kind (that is, if it contains<br>
the property kODPropPreferredKind), the part editor should read its content<br>
data from the indicated value of the content property. If no preferred kind is<br>
specified (or if the part editor cannot handle a value of the specified kind), it<br>
should iterate through the available values looking for one it can handle. When<br>
it finds such a value, it should read the content data from that value into its<br>
runtime data structures.</li>
<li>The InitPartFromStorage method should not add its own properties to the<br>
part's storage unit, but should leave that task to the Externalize method<br>
instead. This is because the user may close the document without modifying<br>
any of its contents. If the InitPartFromStorage method modifies the storage<br>
unit, the user will be prompted to save the document before closing it, even<br>
though the document has not been modified.</li>
<li>The part editor should not alter the part's preferred-kind property<br>
(kODPropPreferredKind).</li>
</ul>

Needless to say, the only real way to get familiar with OpenDoc programming is to<br>
jump in and develop a part editor of your own. The techniques discussed in this article<br>
will help you manage your storage needs effectively. The rest is up to you and your<br>
imagination.
