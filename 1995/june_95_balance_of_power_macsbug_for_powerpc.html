<p>
<i>Where would we be without our venerable friend MacsBug? Those long debugging</i><br>
<i>sessions, with soda cans piling up, would be so lonely. Like a trusted buddy, only a key</i><br>
<i>press away, MacsBug has helped us solve the toughest problems and has taken us into</i><br>
<i>the very core of the Macintosh.</i>
</p>
<p>
Yet now the core has changed. The Macintosh has transmuted into a RISC powerhouse,<br>
and its new runtime environment is a foreign place to the old MacsBug. But instead of<br>
leaving our friend in the past, Apple is developing a next-generation MacsBug. The<br>
next MacsBug, version 6.5, supports PowerPC debugging with the same commands that<br>
you already know. An early release of the new MacsBug is provided on this issue's CD.
</p>
<p>
<b>A QUICK LOOK</b>
</p>
<p>
When we're confronted with a MacsBug display that heralds the beginning of a new<br>
debugging challenge, our first questions are "Where are we?" and "How did we get<br>
here?" MacsBug has always provided tools and information to help us quickly answer<br>
these questions. The stack crawl commands, for example, show not only what code<br>
you're executing but also how you got there. On a Power Macintosh, however, the old<br>
MacsBug often failed at tasks like the stack crawl. The PowerPC architecture changes<br>
fundamental structures -- such as stack frame formats -- and introduces new hurdles<br>
like mixed-mode switches and native code. The key goal of the new MacsBug is to<br>
restore the functionality you need in order to debug on a Power Macintosh.
</p>
<p>
The new MacsBug adds many features to satisfy this goal. It lets you disassemble,<br>
trace, and step through PowerPC code. You can set breakpoints in PowerPC code, and<br>
easily find out what code fragment you've interrupted and what native symbol is<br>
closest. And you can display a stack crawl that includes both PowerPC and 680x0 stack<br>
frames. Let's take a closer look at these and other new features.
</p>
<p>
<b>DISASSEMBLING POWERPC CODE</b>
</p>
<p>
The new MacsBug will disassemble both PowerPC and 680x0 code. Some commands are<br>
now sensitive to which type of code is executing. The td (total display) command will<br>
show the PowerPC register set during execution of native code, and the 680x0<br>
emulated registers during execution of 680x0 code. When used without an address, the<br>
il and ip commands will disassemble the code currently being executed, whether<br>
PowerPC or 680x0; however, when an address is specified with il and ip, MacsBug<br>
will disassemble 680x0 code at the specified address.
</p>
<p>
We've introduced a few new commands to force disassembly of PowerPC native code.<br>
They include the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>    ilp: Instruction list of PowerPC code</li>
<li> ipp: Instruction half-page list of PowerPC code</li>
<li> idp: Instruction display one word as PowerPC code</li>
<li> dhp: Disassemble hex as PowerPC code</li>
<li> brp: Set breakpoint in PowerPC code</li>
</ul>
<p>
To demonstrate, we'll set a native breakpoint in the Memory Manager with <b>brp</b><br>
<b>__SetHandleSize. </b>After we type g and wait for a second, MacsBug interrupts with<br>
this display:
</p>
<pre>PowerPC breakpoint at 000A06C4 __SetHandleSize</pre>
<p>
We type the <b>il</b> command and see the following (notice the familiar breakpoint bullet<br>
and the asterisk showing the current program counter location):
</p>
<pre>Disassembling PowerPC code from 000A06C4
  __SetHandleSize
     +00000 000A06C4 **mflr    r0
     +00004 000A06C8   stmw    r26,-0x0018(SP)
     +00008 000A06CC   stw     r0,0x0008(SP)
     +0000C 000A06D0   stwu    SP,-0x0170(SP)
     +00010 000A06D4   lwz     r30,0x0000(RTOC)
     +00014 000A06D8   addic   r7,SP,72
     +00018 000A06DC   lwz     r26,0x0000(r30)
     +0001C 000A06E0   ori     r31,r4,0x0000
     +00020 000A06E4   stw     r7,0x0000(r30)
     +00024 000A06E8   ori     r29,r5,0x0000
     +00028 000A06EC   lwz     r3,0x0004(RTOC)
     +0002C 000A06F0   bl      __HSetStateQ+013C
     +00030 000A06F4   lwz     RTOC,0x0014(SP)
     +00034 000A06F8   ori     r28,r3,0x0000
     +00038 000A06FC   addic   r3,SP,72</pre>
<p>
From here we can display any PowerPC register, step or trace through the code, or ask<br>
for our location using the improved <b>wh</b> command. The <b>wh</b> command now lists which<br>
code fragment contains the address, using the code fragment export symbols to display<br>
the nearest earlier symbol. In this example, we interrupted at __SetHandleSize in the<br>
MemoryMgr code fragment,&nbsp;&nbsp;so w<b>wh</b> produces this:
</p>
<pre>Address 000A06C4 is in the System heap at
    00002800 at __SetHandleSize
This address is within the code fragment
    named "MemoryMgr".
It is 000021D4 bytes into this heap block:
  Start    Length       Tag  Mstr Ptr  Lock
* 0009E4F0 00009050+04   R   00002BF0   L      </pre>
<p>
<b>CRAWLING AROUND TOGETHER</b>
</p>
<p>
MacsBug version 6.5 distinguishes between PowerPC and 680x0 stack frames but will<br>
display them as a unified stack crawl. This makes it very easy to determine where you<br>
are and where you've been. Since the PowerPC version of the Mac OS still contains a<br>
substantial amount of 680x0 code, you'll often see references to 680x0 callers in the<br>
stack crawl. Otherwise, expect to see the nearest earlier code fragment symbol to each<br>
caller. A sample stack crawl, displayed with the sc command, would look like this:
</p>
<pre>Frame     Caller    ISA
01D87FB2  00013CA0  PPC  'MyApp'+1A0
01D87F4A  00043050  PPC  'MyApp'+2F450
01D87EF0  4085FF06  68K  ComponentDispatch+26
01D87EC8  4085FFE6  68K  ComponentDispatch+106
01D87E50  00063144  PPC  'NativeComponent'+40</pre>
<p>
Here you can see that we're executing a native application with the exported main<br>
symbol MyApp. The application calls a subroutine at MyApp+1A0, leaving the first<br>
stack frame that we see here. Then at MyApp+2F450 the subroutine appears to call<br>
the 680x0-based Component Manager. We assume this because the next two stack<br>
frames are marked "68K" and appear within the ComponentDispatch code. The<br>
Component Manager then calls native code with the symbol NativeComponent. The last<br>
frame is generated when NativeComponent calls a subroutine.
</p>
<p>
<b>EVEN MORE NEW FEATURES</b>
</p>
<p>
Besides support for native Power Macintosh debugging, the new MacsBug adds other<br>
exciting new features, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>    multiple debugger preferences files</li>
<li> better ROM symbols using ROM map files</li>
<li> an improved dcmd format</li>
<li> significant performance improvements on 68040-based Macintosh<br>
computers</li>
</ul>
<p>
We once used ResEdit to construct a single MacsBug preferences file with all our<br>
favorite dcmds and templates. Those days are over: the new MacsBug version will load<br>
up to 32 preferences files that you provide. And if you haven't discarded the ROM list<br>
files provided with MPW, you can build them and use the resulting ROM map files with<br>
the new MacsBug. Put the map files in the new MacsBug preferences folder to use the<br>
map's symbol information. When disassembling or displaying addresses in the ROM,<br>
MacsBug will then display better symbols.
</p>
<p>
The improved dcmd format adds new action calls and an expanded parameter block<br>
structure, which provides full access to the PowerPC register set and machine state.<br>
Although this doesn't give you special support for developing PowerPC-native dcmds,<br>
you now have access to valuable internal state information. With this new information,<br>
your dcmds can do things that were previously reserved for Apple dcmds, such as tdp<br>
(total dump PowerPC), which was introduced in the article "Debugging on PowerPC"<br>
in <i>develop</i> Issue 17. This dcmd, among others from Apple, has intimate knowledge of<br>
how the PowerPC system software works. With the new dcmd format, this intimate<br>
knowledge is no longer necessary since MacsBug provides access to everything you'll<br>
need.
</p>
<p>
The new dcmd format has been designed with maximum flexibility in mind. Your dcmds<br>
can check at run time for the availability of MacsBug features. When new callbacks are<br>
defined, you can check whether MacsBug supports the calls, rather than being tied to a<br>
specific MacsBug version.
</p>
<p>
On 68040-based Macintosh computers, MacsBug will perform most tasks much<br>
faster, and with an important side effect. The new MacsBug doesn't flush the 68040<br>
processor cache nearly as often, greatly improving performance for most commands.<br>
The key side effect is for bugs related to cache flushing: in the past, MacsBug would<br>
flush the cache frequently enough to make these bugs hard to reproduce when you're<br>
stepping or using breakpoints; the new MacsBug, with its selective flushing, should<br>
allow you to more readily reproduce this type of problem.
</p>
<p>
<b>IT'S LOG, LOG, LOG!</b>
</p>
<p>
Here at Apple, bugs are usually found by test engineers using automated scripts and<br>
manual testing. When they find a bug in our code, we're rarely nearby to analyze it<br>
immediately. Therefore, they collect key information so that we can later reproduce<br>
the problem. One useful piece of information they collect is called a <i>standard log.</i>
</p>
<p>
The standard log is a sequence of MacsBug commands that are run after a crash or<br>
interrupt -- for example, a register display and stack crawl. These commands are<br>
logged in a text file, and the result is copied into a report that describes the problem.<br>
Having this information in the problem report saves significant time and sometimes<br>
provides enough detail to resolve the problem immediately. MacsBug version 6.5<br>
makes this log useful on the Power Macintosh. Its improved stack crawl, native<br>
disassembly, and PowerPC register display provide key information for later analysis.<br>
We recommend that you incorporate a standard log into your testing process; you'll<br>
find ours included as the StdLog macro.
</p>
<p>
<b>DON'T HESITATE</b>
</p>
<p>
You can read the release notes provided on the CD for detailed descriptions of these and<br>
other improvements. We hope you'll install the new version of MacsBug without delay!

<b>DAVE EVANS </b>denies rumors that he modeled for the Mac OS logo. Although he works<br>
in the Mac OS team at Apple and does perpetually smile -- and his favorite color is<br>
blue -- Dave could never sit still long enough for the pose. You're more likely to spot<br>
him racing off in his hunter green Jeep Sahara. He'll probably be late, after fitting too<br>
many activities into his day, and he'll certainly be en route to some new adventure.
</p>
<p>
<b>JIM MURPHY </b>(AppleLink MURPH, Internet murph@apple.com) dislikes one thing<br>
more than the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey club without superstar center Mario<br>
Lemieux, and that's a Macintosh without MacsBug. When he's not dodging a tedious<br>
meeting at Apple, blearily staring at a logic analyzer, or hacking the Mac OS boot<br>
process, he can be found plying the backroads of the Santa Cruz mountains in his<br>
trusty Miata.
