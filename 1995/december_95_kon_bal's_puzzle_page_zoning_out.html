</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got a small problem I'd like you to help me with.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who's paying the airfare this time?
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing like that. It's really quite straightforward, and surprisingly<br>
reproducible. The problem is that sometimes when I'm using Microsoft Word 5.1a and<br>
I pull down a menu, when I let go of the menu there's garbage on the screen where the<br>
menu was.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a problem they were having in the beta release, but I think it's fixed<br>
in the final version of Windows 95.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, this is on a Power Macintosh 6100, and I haven't yet installed<br>
Windows 95 on top of my SoftPC, which runs on my 68000, which is being emulated<br>
by Gary's emulator.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft is still in the loop.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it's not just a Microsoft problem. I can't seem to make it happen with<br>
Word by itself. It only seems to happen if I run and quit cc:Mail before running Word.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That darn Justice Department! Without them you could just be running<br>
Microsoft mail, and you probably wouldn't have this problem.
</p>
<p>
Try running Word; then launch and quit cc:Mail. Does it still happen?
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Word is working fine. In fact, Word works in every case -- at least as far<br>
as this problem is concerned -- unless I launch and quit cc:Mail before launching and<br>
quitting Word. And the interesting thing is that it only happens with the Modern<br>
Memory Manager on.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just run your machine with the classic Memory Manager. I have problems<br>
running THINK C's debugger when I use the Thread Manager and the Modern Memory<br>
Manager. There's just too many of these kinds of bugs to deal with!
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so fast, QuickDraw. The Modern Memory Manager gives you lots of great<br>
new features. First of all, your machine will run faster. In addition to being ported<br>
native, it also uses much more efficient algorithms. It keeps track of free blocks in a<br>
separate list, keeps track of heap zones to make RecoverHandle work better, and has a<br>
back pointer so that blocks can be walked either way, drastically decreasing<br>
heap-walking time and making things much more efficient -- especially when virtual<br>
memory is on. Also, the Modern Memory Manager was designed to be bus error proof,<br>
in that it returns from any internally generated exception by returning an error to its<br>
caller (though this was changed in the latest version of the Modern Memory Manager,<br>
as you may have read in the Balance of Power column in develop Issue 23). Finally, in<br>
the old Memory Manager moving the partition between the system and Process<br>
Manager heaps was a total nightmare; this problem was solved in the Modern Memory<br>
Manager.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anytime you port something native you have two choices: rewrite the code<br>
directly, preserving internal algorithms and data structures, or rethink and<br>
reimplement, preserving only the top-level application interface. The first choice<br>
virtually guarantees compatibility but makes it difficult to maintain in the future,<br>
while the second gives you slightly less compatibility but a much better upgrade path,<br>
better maintainability, and a much more efficient system. It sounds like they went<br>
with the second choice, but at the obvious expense of some short-term compatibility<br>
problems. And it seems like that's what we're dealing with here.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the philosophy lesson. Are you going to solve the problem?
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK. Launch and quit cc:Mail and check all the heaps. Look for orphaned<br>
memory, locked blocks being left around, or any other signs of an application not<br>
properly cleaning up after itself.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to install MacsBug to do that. I'll install version 6.5d11 because it has<br>
some new PowerPC features in case we need them.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm afraid we will.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after we quit cc:Mail, the system heap grew some, but all the heaps seem<br>
fine. We have an extra 128-byte pointer, and we have five extra handles for a total of<br>
almost 32K, but three of those (25K) are purgeable.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this extra stuff lying around certainly explains why I have to reboot every<br>
couple of hours.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and those OS engineers really worked on that problem. On System 7.5<br>
you get a pretty picture and a nice thermometer bar!
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So try the patch dcmd. It will tell you what traps have been patched. Before you<br>
run cc:Mail, type
</p>
<pre>patch s</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
to grab a snapshot of all the traps. When you're in cc:Mail, just type
</p>
<pre>patch</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
and you'll get a list of all the traps that have been patched. It's a great way to find<br>
random skankiness.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only OS trap that they patch is _Rename, and they patch the Toolbox traps<br>
_Pack8, _UserDelay, _SysErr, _LoadSeg, _UnloadSeg, and _ExitToShell.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, and what's still patched after the application quits?
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing. It seems to totally clean up.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonderful. What does Word patch?
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OS traps _Rename and _CompactMem, and the Toolbox traps _Pack8,<br>
_UserDelay, _HiliteWindow, _FrontWindow, _SysError, _LoadSeg, and _ExitToShell.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a lot of overlap. We should check a do-nothing generic<br>
application. I bet the system is magically patching some stuff when it runs an<br>
application.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that all those traps except _HiliteWindow, _FrontWindow,<br>
_CompactMem, and _UnloadSeg are always getting patched.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It figures. Word is augmenting parts of the Memory Manager and getting in on<br>
some Window Manager action, and cc:Mail is playing games with the Segment Loader.<br>
Where's that book on Macintosh programming guidelines?
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think they read that in Redmond. By the way, even though menu code is<br>
fairly boilerplate, this one's a mixed bag. Netscape, SimpleText, and FindFile work<br>
fine, but Word and THINK Reference fail consistently.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy, times have changed. I remember when you used to just dive right into<br>
MacsBug, disassemble a bunch of code, and get to the bottom of these problems. Now<br>
you're looking at what SimpleText does compared to Word!
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not the one who's doing it. I don't even touch the computer anymore. It's one<br>
of my henchmen, Paul Young.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, there are two ways the bits behind the menus get redrawn. If plenty<br>
of memory is available, they get back-buffered and restored with CopyBits. If there's<br>
not much memory, an update event is generated.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Word is the only application running at the time, we have plenty of<br>
memory.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set a breakpoint on CopyBits and pull a menu down. The first break will be<br>
when the bits are being saved. Let's look at the address, step over the call, and make<br>
sure the right data was put there. When you let the menu up, you'll break on CopyBits<br>
again. Is the source data correct -- that is, is the source our previous destination?
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The base address when the bits are restored isn't the same as the base address<br>
when they get saved.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the base address? Is it part of a handle that moved?
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The base address for the restore is $40810000.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is dereferencing zero! It sounds like the bits are getting saved in a<br>
handle, and somehow the handle is getting trashed. Let's follow the handle from the save<br>
and see what happens to it.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bits are being saved, the base address is part of a handle in<br>
MultiFinder temporary memory. The handle is $438 bytes long.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens to that memory on the restore?
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory still exists, and the data is fine. It's just that the PixMap doesn't<br>
point there anymore.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we need to figure out where the Menu Manager is storing the PixMap and<br>
why that location is getting trashed.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Menu Manager uses SaveBits and RestoreBits, which allocate memory for<br>
the pixels using the offscreen buffer calls that return PixMaps. The PixMap base<br>
address does double duty: when it's unlocked it's a handle; when it's locked it's a<br>
pointer. There's a flag in rowBytes to indicate what state it's in. To go from the locked<br>
state to the unlocked state, the GWorld routines call RecoverHandle.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's break on RecoverHandle and see what we get back.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It returns 0. But why?
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's kind of weird that this happens only with the Modern Memory Manager. In<br>
the old Memory Manager, you had to set the heap zone before calling RecoverHandle.<br>
The Modern Memory Manager&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relaxed this restriction and keeps a tree of valid heaps.<br>
When you call RecoverHandle, it walks the heap tree. If cc:Mail is somehow corrupting<br>
the tree, RecoverHandle will fail.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice theory. How are you going to test that?
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.T.O. 17 has a debugging version of the native Memory Manager that will<br>
print out diagnostics anytime weird stuff happens. Let's install it and reboot.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you boot, you drop into MacsBug with the message "Bad pointer being<br>
passed to RecoverHandle 00030020." It looks like "PC Exchange" was loading.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's try booting with the extensions off. Use the Extensions Manager so that<br>
you can keep MacsBug, the Memory control panel (so that we're sure we're in the<br>
Modern Memory Manager), and the Debugging Memory Manager.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I run the Extensions Manager, I break into MacsBug with the message<br>
"Bad handle; are you unlocking a fake handle?"
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A complete treatise on all the memory crimes committed in the Macintosh is<br>
beyond the scope of this column.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without superfluous extensions, the problem at boot time goes away, but we<br>
still have the problem in Word.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let's look at the zones and see if everything looks OK. Let's do an hz to list<br>
all the heap zones.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK. But hz doesn't use the heap tree, so if you want to check the heap tree you'll<br>
have to do it manually.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. I'll use the SmartFriends debugging trick and call Jeff to figure out how<br>
to do that.
</p>
<p>
<b>Jeff</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heap tree is part of the zone header. The system zone starts at $2800, and<br>
a pointer to the next zone starts at offset $20. $2820 contains $1672DF0.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should be the Process Manager zone. But that number is really big. How<br>
could that be? How many fonts do you have installed?!
</p>
<p>
<b>Jeff</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the system heap can grow, we put the Process Manager zone header at the<br>
end of the block, so we don't have to move the header every time the heap size changes.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next zone in the Process Manager is nil, since at the top level there are<br>
only two zones: the system zone and the Process Manager zone.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's look at the child zones inside the Process Manager.
</p>
<p>
<b>Jeff </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child zones are pointed to by offset $24 in the zone header.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first child zone is the Word zone, which corresponds to what we got from<br>
hz. And the Word zone header has no child zones.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the world makes sense so far. Does the next zone pointer make sense?
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's kind of wacky. It points inside the Word heap!
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a problem. Does that zone header look reasonable, at least?
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. It's trash. It looks like Word code.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens if you don't run cc:Mail before running Word? And how does the<br>
Memory Manager know how to update the zone headers? There's no call to explicitly<br>
destroy zones, only create&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll take the second question first. Zones are created by InitZone, and they're<br>
never explicitly destroyed. In the Modern Memory Manager, there's new logic in<br>
DisposeHandle that checks to see if the handle is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a zone; if so, it assumes the zone is<br>
destroyed and updates the heap tree.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the skankiness ever end?
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I run Word without first running cc:Mail, the heap tree is OK.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we just need to figure out why the heap tree is getting trashed. Even<br>
though the tree update algorithm is implicit, it seems pretty good at first blush. Let's<br>
go through the failing scenario and compare the heap zones to the tree and figure out<br>
when they diverge.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we run cc:Mail, hz doesn't agree with the zone structure we get by<br>
walking the heap tree. Here's what the two structures look like:
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/268.gif" width="447 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the cc:Mail zone is smaller than the handle of the memory it's in. Someone<br>
limited the size of the application zone. In the heap tree view, it's clear why: another<br>
zone is being allocated; 32K is left between the zones, and that space is being used for<br>
the stack.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason hz can't find the second zone is that before the Modern Memory<br>
Manager, no one kept explicit track of the zones. Basically, the hz command has to<br>
search for the zones. It does this by starting from the system zone, which is always<br>
pointed to by low memory (and is usually located after the trap tables at $2800).<br>
From the system heap zone header, it can find the zone trailer. Right after that block is<br>
the Process Manager zone header. It walks all the blocks in a zone and finds all the<br>
handles that look like other zones. It starts by assuming that the handle contains a<br>
zone, and then checks to see if the zone header points to a block that looks like a trailer<br>
and if the trailer points back to the zone header. When it looks for zones inside other<br>
zones, it assumes that they begin either at the start of the handle or right after another<br>
zone. Since cc:Mail has its stack space between the two zones, the hz command can't<br>
find it.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK. Unfortunately we're not debugging the hz command. But that probably gives<br>
us a clue as to why the Modern Memory Manager is getting confused. It seems to keep<br>
pretty good track of the zones that are getting created, since that's easy by just<br>
watching InitZone. But it gets confused when the zones are being disposed of, since it<br>
does that by watching DisposeHandle.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. The heap tree gets trashed when cc:Mail quits, since the Modern<br>
Memory Manager assumes that there's only one zone (and perhaps its children) in any<br>
handle. So when it sees the dispose, it throws away the first zone and all its children,<br>
but it doesn't throw away the second zone. It works fine with the old Memory Manager<br>
since no one ever explicitly keeps track of all the zones. But the Modern Memory<br>
Manager uses the heap tree for RecoverHandle, and the tree is trashed, so either the<br>
machine crashes or you get garbage.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's pretty interesting. In this case, neither cc:Mail nor Word did anything<br>
wrong. The way cc:Mail used the Memory Manager was nonstandard, and when the<br>
algorithms in the Modern Memory Manager changed, there were some interesting cases<br>
that fell through the cracks. I think the newer version of cc:Mail no longer allocates<br>
zones this way. And the Memory Manager will undoubtedly soon be smarter.
</p>
<p>
<b>BAL </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasty.
</p>
<p>
<b>KON&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.
