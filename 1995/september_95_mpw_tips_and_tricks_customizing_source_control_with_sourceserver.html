<h1>MPW Tips and Tricks: Customizing Source Control<br>
With SourceServer</h1>

</p>
<p>
When two engineers on a team edit the same source file at the same time, the resulting<br>
chaos can be terrible to behold. Source control was invented to mitigate the problem.<br>
Most Macintosh programmers are familiar with the MPW Shell's Check In and Check<br>
Out dialogs, and with its Projector commands. The next frontier of custom source<br>
control involves SourceServer, a nearly faceless application that implements most of<br>
the Projector commands. MPW scripts are easy to write, but they're no match for the<br>
power, speed, and friendliness of compiled software. SourceServer exports Projector<br>
commands as Apple events, allowing source control from compiled software without<br>
launching the MPW Shell in all its pomp and splendor.
</p>
<p>
Popular third-party development environments often send Apple events to<br>
SourceServer for integrated source control. You can also use SourceServer to<br>
customize Projector beyond what you might have thought possible. For instance, you<br>
can drag source control, kicking and screaming, into the modern world of user<br>
experience with drop-on applications. In this column, I'll show you how to check a file<br>
in or out with a simple drag and drop, and how to use SourceServer for other things as<br>
well. The sample code is provided on this issue's CD; SourceServer is distributed, with<br>
documentation, on the MPW Pro and E.T.O. CDs (available from Apple Developer<br>
Catalog) and with third-party development systems.
</p>
<h2>APPLE EVENTS FOR SOURCESERVER</h2>
<p>
Apple events have many faces, but they're primarily a way of communicating between<br>
different applications.
</p>
<p>
Each Apple event encapsulates a message as a command with any number of input<br>
parameters; the receiver of the message may return any number of result parameters<br>
to the sender. The most basic unit of data is the Apple event descriptor, which consists<br>
of a type code and a data handle. Apple events are built out of descriptors and are<br>
themselves special kinds of complex descriptors.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>For an excellent introduction to Apple events, </b>see "Scripting the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finder From Your Application" by&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg Anderson in <i>develop</i> Issue 20.*
</p>
<p>
SourceServer's commands are represented as descriptor lists. Its Apple events are<br>
exact duplicates of the MPW Shell's Projector commands, but to avoid the overhead of a<br>
full command parser, both the command name and each argument are descriptors in<br>
the descriptor list. This saves you the trouble of putting quotes and escapes into<br>
arguments that might contain spaces or other special characters. The downside is that<br>
you have to expand arguments yourself: you can't pass in MPW wildcard characters,<br>
backquoted commands for expansion, or other special constructs.
</p>
<p>
Creating descriptor lists may sound harder than writing MPW scripts, but that's only<br>
because it is. I've provided some utility routines to ease the way, though. Listing 1<br>
shows the utilities and illustrates how to make a command to check out a file for<br>
modification. As illustrated in the CheckOut routine in this listing, you call the<br>
CreateCommand routine first and then use the AddXArg routines to add arguments.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1. </b>Creating SourceServer commands
</p>
<pre>OSErr CreateCommand(AEDesc *command, CString commandText)
// Begin a new SourceServer command; name of command is in
// commandText.
{
   OSErr err = AECreateList(NULL, 0, false, command);
   if (err != noErr) return err;
   err = AddCStringArg(command, commandText);
   if (err != noErr) (void) AEDisposeDesc(command);
   return err;
}

OSErr AddCommentArg(AEDesc *command, StringPtr comment)
/* Add a "-cs comment" argument to a SourceServer command. */
{
   OSErr err;
   if (comment[0] == 0) return noErr;
   err = AddCStringArg(command, "-cs");
   if (err != noErr) return err;
   err = AddPStringArg(command, comment);
   return err;
}

/* Other SourceServer argument utilities */
OSErr AddDirArg(AEDesc *command, short vRefNum, long folderID);
OSErr AddProjectArg(AEDesc *command, StringPtr projectName);
OSErr AddUserArg(AEDesc *command, StringPtr userName);
OSErr AddFullNameArg(AEDesc *command, FSSpec *file);
OSErr AddPStringArg(AEDesc *command, StringPtr string);
OSErr AddCStringArg(AEDesc *command, CString string);

OSErr CheckOut(FSSpec *file, StringPtr userName,
               StringPtr projectName, StringPtr comment)
/* Create a "Check Out Modifiable" command for SourceServer: */
/* CheckOut -m -cs &lt;comment&gt; -d &lt;dir&gt; -project &lt; */
/*           project&gt; -u &lt;user&gt; &lt;file&gt; */
{
   OSErr             err;
   AEDesc          command;
   CStringHandle    output = NULL, diagnostic = NULL;

   err = CreateCommand(&amp;command, "CheckOut");
   if (err != noErr) return err;
   err = AddCStringArg(&amp;command, "-m");
   if (err == noErr) err = AddCommentArg(&amp;command, comment);
   if (err == noErr)
     err = AddDirArg(&amp;command, file-&gt;vRefNum, file-&gt;parID);
   if (err == noErr) err = AddProjectArg(&amp;command, projectName);
   if (err == noErr) err = AddUserArg(&amp;command, userName);
   if (err == noErr) err = AddPStringArg(&amp;command, file-&gt;name);
   if (err == noErr)
     err = SourceServerCommand(&amp;command, &amp;output, &amp;diagnostic);
   (void) AEDisposeDesc(&amp;command);
   /* Display output or diagnostic text as desired. */
   if (output != NULL) DisposeHandle((Handle) output);
   if (diagnostic != NULL) DisposeHandle((Handle) diagnostic);
   return err;
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Some of the utilities take Pascal strings, while others take C strings, which could well<br>
be considered bad programming practice. I chose this dubious method not because I'm<br>
on drugs, but because Pascal strings and C strings are used in different ways.<br>
SourceServer's text descriptors are C strings; when passed to these utilities as string<br>
constants, they shouldn't be converted from Pascal format in place, since some<br>
compilers put constants in read-only areas. If you're internationally savvy, you may<br>
have another objection: string constants themselves are bad practice. However, for<br>
better or worse, MPW scripts and tools are not internationalized. Just like aliens in<br>
<i>Star Trek</i>, all MPW programmers are assumed to speak English.
</p>
<p>
While on the subject of programming practice, I must gently reprimand SourceServer<br>
for its approach to Apple events, in which script commands are simulated through a<br>
single 'cmnd' event. SourceServer's idiosyncratic convention dates from the earliest<br>
days of Apple events, and modern guidelines discourage this type of design. An<br>
application implementing its own Apple events should designate a different command<br>
code for each operation, treating arguments as keyword parameters.
</p>
<p>
Listing 2 shows how to send an Apple event to SourceServer. It's first necessary to find<br>
and perhaps launch the SourceServer application. The snippet called SignatureToApp<br>
(by Jens Alfke) on this issue's CD accomplishes this with a single function call.<br>
Simply pass in the creator code of SourceServer, which is 'MPSP'.
</p>

   /* Create and send the SourceServer Apple event. */
   err = AECreateAppleEvent('MPSP', 'cmnd', &amp;sourceServerAddress,
                           kAutoGenerateReturnID, kAnyTransactionID,

<p>
The event must be created before it can be sent. For SourceServer, there's a single<br>
parameter, named keyDirectObject, which is the descriptor list containing the<br>
command. After sending the event, you must extract the results. The results of an<br>
Apple event are returned as keyword parameters in a reply descriptor. First there's<br>
the standard keyErrorNumber parameter, which returns an error code if delivery<br>
failed. SourceServer returns three other parameters: The 'stat' parameter contains a<br>
second error code; if it's nonzero, SourceServer tried to execute the command and<br>
failed. When there's an error, there will be diagnostic output in the 'diag' parameter, a<br>
handle containing text from the MPW diagnostic (error) channel. Finally, there's<br>
standard output -- a handle specified by keyDirectObject -- which contains<br>
explanatory text.

<h2>PROJECTDRAG -- DRAG AND DROP SOURCE CONTROL</h2>
<p>
The Macintosh has always had a drag and drop user experience, but the true power and<br>
generality of dragging has been widely recognized only recently. The drag paradigm can<br>
even be used for source control. To turn Projector into a drag-savvy system, I've<br>
written a set of utilities called ProjectDrag (source code and documentation are<br>
provided on this issue's CD). You simply drag and drop icons onto the following<br>
miniapplications that make up ProjectDrag, and the corresponding function is<br>
performed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Check In and Check Out, for checking files in and out</li>
<li>ModifyReadOnly, for editing a file without checking it out</li>
<li>Update, for bringing a file or folder up to date, as well as canceling<br>
checkouts and modify-read-only changes</li>
<li>ProjectDrag Setup, for configuring the system</li>
</ul>
<p>
These utilities are based on a drop-on application framework called DropShell<br>
(written by Leonard Rosenthol and Stephan Somogyi), also on the CD. When a file is<br>
dropped onto an application, the application receives an Open Documents ('odoc')<br>
event. DropShell takes care of the rigmarole of receiving this and other required Apple<br>
events. The ProjectDrag miniapplications pull the file specifications out of 'odoc'<br>
events and create SourceServer commands that operate on the files and folders that<br>
were dropped on their icons.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>DropShell is also available on the Internet </b>at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ftp://ftp.hawaii.edu/pub/mac/info-mac/Development/src/ and at other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Info-Mac mirror sites.*
</p>
<p>
Some setup is required. ProjectDrag needs to know the locations of Projector<br>
databases. It maps between project names and Projector database files by keeping<br>
aliases to database folders in its Preferences folder. To start using a project, simply<br>
drag its ProjectorDB file or the enclosing folder onto ProjectDrag Setup. Projector<br>
also needs to know your user name, and your initials or a nickname are used in change<br>
comments at the start of files. These are stored in a text file in the Preferences folder.<br>
ProjectDrag asks you for this information if it can't find it, or you can launch<br>
ProjectDrag Setup and give the Set User Name command.
</p>
<p>
ProjectDrag is scriptable, unlike SourceServer and the MPW Shell. The<br>
miniapplications have an Apple event terminology resource ('aete') to advertise their<br>
events to scripting systems. This allows you to add source control commands to any<br>
application that lets you add AppleScript scripts to its menus.
</p>
<p>
ProjectDrag is able to run remotely over a network. This circumvents a limitation of<br>
SourceServer, which can only be driven locally. ProjectDrag can receive remote Apple<br>
events and then drive a copy of SourceServer that's local to it. Among other uses, this<br>
could support an accelerator for Apple Remote Access. Checking a file in or out over<br>
ARA takes a few minutes, which is fine, especially for those who find tedium<br>
particularly enjoyable. Copying files is faster. With local AppleScript front ends for<br>
remote ProjectDrag miniapplications, you could copy files to and from a remote<br>
"shadow folder" and initiate SourceServer commands at the remote location, where<br>
they would execute over a fast network such as Ethernet.
</p>
<p>
I like to think that I can solve user interface problems in my sleep. When I was<br>
writing ProjectDrag, I had a dream of a better user experience. Instead of<br>
miniapplications, ProjectDrag would be a magical system extension that would put a<br>
single small icon at some convenient place on the screen. When you dragged a file onto<br>
this icon, it would pop open into a temporary window and show you icons for the<br>
various options. Dreams are great for creativity, but it's easier to weigh alternatives<br>
when you're awake. After I woke up, I realized that miniapplications will be able to do<br>
the same thing.
</p>
<p>
Here's how: In Copland, the next generation of the Mac OS, the Finder will spring-load<br>
folders so that they open automatically when you drag onto them. It will also let you<br>
stash commonly used folders at the bottom of the screen, where they appear as short<br>
title bars. Drag the ProjectDrag folder to the bottom of the screen and you're set! Since<br>
the Finder will be providing my dream interface, there's no point in a lot of trap<br>
patching and extensibility infrastructure to accomplish the same thing.
</p>
<p>
Copland will bring another user experience benefit to ProjectDrag: it's planned that<br>
document windows will have a draggable file icon in their title bar, so you'll be able to<br>
use ProjectDrag on an open document by dragging the icon from its window.
</p>
<h2>YOU TAKE IT FROM HERE</h2>
<p>
You can create programs that use SourceServer for many other tasks. On<br>
cross-platform projects, Projector is sometimes used to control both platforms'<br>
source folders. This can lead to baroque and error-prone processes. With<br>
SourceServer, you can create front ends that do the right thing. They could copy to<br>
remote folders over a network, or lock read-only files since the other platform doesn't<br>
see Projector's 'ckid' resources.
</p>
<p>
Quality is an interesting area for source control applications. A quality tool could<br>
query Projector databases for the frequency and scope of changes at various stages of<br>
the project, correlating them with bug tracking to develop project metrics. Along<br>
similar lines, a tool could measure the change rate of various files to assist in what the<br>
quality gods refer to as root-cause analysis.
</p>
<p>
SourceServer is much more than a way for development systems to provide integrated<br>
source control. It's great for structuring your internal development process as well!
