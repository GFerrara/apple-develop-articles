<i>One of the things the Finder does best is maintain the illusion that an icon and its</i><br>
<i>window represent a single object. Using the routines described in this article, your</i><br>
<i>application can help maintain that illusion. You can ensure that when the user renames</i><br>
<i>an open document, the change is reflected in the document window's title. You can also</i><br>
<i>gracefully handle problems that may arise if the document file is moved. Other</i><br>
<i>improvements that make your application's interface more consistent with the</i><br>
<i>Finder's include preventing a second window from opening when an open document's</i><br>
<i>icon is double-clicked and adding a pop-up navigation menu to the document window's</i><br>
<i>title bar.</i>
</p>
<p>
To rename a folder or file in the Finder, you click the icon name, type a new name, and<br>
press Return. For folders, if the window is open, the change is reflected right away in<br>
the window's title bar. But for files, if the document is open in your application, its<br>
window may not reflect the name change. Try this little experiment: Create a document<br>
in your application and save it. Switch to the Finder, find your document, and change<br>
its name. What did your application do? If it's like most applications, nothing<br>
happened: the document window has the same name as before. Go ahead and try to use<br>
Save As to give the file the same name you gave it in the Finder. You probably get an<br>
error message. Now try to save the document under the original name. Do you still get<br>
an error message? Quit your application and read on for a way out of this frustration.
</p>
<p>
The only convenient way for a user to rename a document is with the Finder. (The Save<br>
As command doesn't rename a document; it creates a copy of the document with a new<br>
name.) As you've just seen, name changes made in the Finder aren't automatically<br>
reflected in an open document window. Another change that's often not picked up by the<br>
application is when the user moves the document to a different folder. The code in this<br>
article helps synchronize your application's documents with their corresponding files,<br>
so that a document will respond to changes made outside the application to its file's<br>
name or location.
</p>
<p>
This article also describes how to prevent a duplicate window from being opened if the<br>
user opens an already open document in the Finder and how to add a pop-up menu to the<br>
document title bar to help the user determine where the file is stored. All the code for<br>
implementing these features is provided on this issue's CD, along with a sample<br>
application that illustrates its use.
</p>
<h2>DOCUMENT SYNCHRONIZATION</h2>
<p>
The <i>Electronic Guide to Macintosh Human Interface Design</i> says that applications<br>
should "match the window title to the filename." Specifically, when a user changes the<br>
document name in the Finder, you should update all references to the title. The guide<br>
also refers to the <i>Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines,</i>page 143, where it says, "The<br>
document and its corresponding window name must match at all times."
</p>
<p>
When I first started looking at the problem of document synchronization, I assumed<br>
that the animated example in the Electronic Guide to Macintosh Human Interface Design<br>
was the way to go. In this animation, the application checks for a name change when it<br>
receives a resume event. However, I became uncomfortable with this approach,<br>
because it would cause a delay between the user's changing the name of the document in<br>
the Finder and the application's updating the window title. Using a resume event relies<br>
on a separate action by the user, namely, bringing the application to the foreground.<br>
This seemed nonintuitive and didn't support the illusion that a window and its icon<br>
represent a single object. Also, it's possible that with Apple events and AppleScript an<br>
application could be launched, do some work, and quit without ever being frontmost --<br>
that is, without ever receiving a resume event.
</p>
<p>
The truth is that these days, with multiple applications running at the same time, with<br>
networked, shared disks everywhere, and with applications and scripts pulling the<br>
puppet strings as often as users, a file's name or location may change at any time,<br>
whether the application is in the foreground or the background. A script might move or<br>
rename a file or, if the file is on a shared volume, another user on the network could<br>
move or rename it or even put the file in the Trash -- all behind the application's<br>
back. The only solution I found under the current system software was to regularly<br>
look at the file to see if its name or location has changed. In other words, the<br>
application has to poll for changes.
</p>
<p>
Polling is generally a bad idea, but there are cases when it's the only reasonable way to<br>
accomplish a task, and this is one of them. However, I tried to keep the polling very<br>
"lightweight" and low impact by using the following guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An application shouldn't poll any more often than it absolutely needs to.<br>
Waking up an application causes a context switch, and context switches take a<br>
significant amount of time. Forcing the system to wake up an application every<br>
few ticks just so that it can look for file changes would be a bad idea,<br>
especially when the application is in the background. Instead, the application<br>
should poll only when an event has already been received -- that is, when the<br>
application is awake. Set your WaitNextEvent sleep time appropriately, and<br>
wait at least a second or two between "peeks." (The Finder, for instance, polls<br>
for disk changes every five seconds or so.)</li>
<li>Avoid any polling that causes disk or network access; if at all possible,<br>
examine only information that's in RAM on the local machine. Network access<br>
in particular can be a real drain on performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The sample code follows this advice, doing everything it can to be unobtrusive. It polls<br>
for file changes only once every second while in the foreground. In the background, the<br>
application's WaitNextEvent sleep time is set to ten seconds, so it only wakes up --<br>
and thus polls -- every ten seconds if nothing else is going on. To detect changes to<br>
files, I chose to examine the volume modification date of the volume containing the file,<br>
since this information is always available in local RAM, even for a shared volume. If<br>
that date changes, I look deeper to see if the change is one I'm interested in. As you dip<br>
into the code, you'll see the details.<b>I use the file reference number</b> to track files<br>
because it survives changes in the name and parent directory. However, this requires<br>
that the files be kept open. If&nbsp;&nbsp;you can't keep your files open, you might want to look at<br>
John Norstad's excellent NewsWatcher application, which uses alias records to<br>
synchronize files. NewsWatcher is on this issue's CD; its official source can be found<br>
at ftp://ftp.acns.nwu.edu/pub/newswatcher/.*
</p>
<p>
Friendly as it is, this polling solution is appropriate only for the current system<br>
software; future system software versions (such as Copland, the next generation of the<br>
Mac OS) will provide a much better way to detect changes. Your application will be<br>
able to subscribe to notification of changes that it's interested in. In fact, polling the<br>
current file system structures will be unfriendly behavior under Copland, which will<br>
have demand-paged virtual memory and a completely new file system. For this reason,<br>
the sample code is designed to work only under System 7. You'll be able to easily<br>
retrofit the code to run under Copland once the details of the correct way to detect file<br>
changes have been worked out.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE HEART OF THE MATTER</b>
</p>
<p>
Every Macintosh programmer eventually comes to grips with how to keep track of all<br>
the information associated with a document. I use a structure called a document list and<br>
I have a set of routines that support it. The document list reverses some common<br>
assumptions used by developers. Developers often use the window list to track their<br>
windows and attach their document data to it, but this limits Apple's ability to redefine<br>
the window list. My recommendation is to create a document list (almost identical to<br>
the window list) containing the document data and attach the windows to it. In this way,<br>
the actual structure of the window list is not a concern. You'll find my implementation<br>
of the document list and its supporting routines on this issue's CD.
</p>
<p>
While the code presented here is specific to my implementation, you can easily<br>
generalize it as needed. The code below shows how your application might call<br>
DSSyncWindowsWithFiles, a routine that keeps your documents synchronized with the<br>
Finder by checking for and handling changes made outside the application to file names<br>
or locations. Call the routine from within your main event loop when you receive an<br>
event (including null events). Note that error checking has been removed from the<br>
code shown in the article, but it does appear on the CD.
</p>
<pre>while (!done) {
   gotEvent = WaitNextEvent(everyEvent, &amp;theEvent, gSleepTime,
      theCursorRegion);
   if (gotEvent)
      DoEvent(&amp;theEvent);
   DSSyncWindowsWithFiles(kDontForceSynchronization);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This minor change does most of the work for your application. The machinery that<br>
makes it happen lies within DSSyncWindowsWithFiles (see Listing 1). This routine<br>
first checks to make sure that enough time has passed since the last check for changes.<br>
If so, or if the caller requested immediate synchronization, it iterates through each of<br>
the windows registered in the document list, calling DSSyncWindowWithFile to<br>
process each of these windows.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1. </b>DSSyncWindowsWithFiles
</p>
<pre>#define kCheckTicks 60

pascal void DSSyncWindowsWithFiles(Boolean forceSync)
{
   WindowPtr        theWindow;
   static long      theTicksOfLastCheck = 0;
   long             theTicks;
  
   theTicks = TickCount();
   if (theTicks &gt; (theTicksOfLastCheck + kCheckTicks) || forceSync){
      theTicksOfLastCheck = theTicks;
      for (theWindow = DSFirstWindow(); theWindow != nil;
           theWindow = DSNextWindow(theWindow)) {
         DSSyncWindowWithFile(theWindow);
      }
   }
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
DSSyncWindowWithFile, shown in Listing 2, begins by getting the file reference<br>
number for the window from the document list. If it's appropriate to continue<br>
(DoSyncChecks returns true), DSSyncWindowWithFile calls three other routines to<br>
handle name changes, changes that move the file to a different folder, and changes that<br>
move the file to the Trash.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 2. </b>DSSyncWindowWithFile
</p>
<pre>pascal void DSSyncWindowWithFile(WindowPtr aWindow)
{
   short theFRefNum;

   DSGetWindowDFRefNum(aWindow, &amp;theFRefNum);
   if (DoSyncChecks(theFRefNum, aWindow)) {
      HandleNameChange(theFRefNum, aWindow);
      HandleDirectoryChange(theFRefNum, aWindow);
      HandleMoveToTrash(theFRefNum, aWindow);
   }
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>THE CHECKPOINT</b>
</p>
<p>
The DoSyncChecks routine (Listing 3) checks for changes to the volume that the file is<br>
on. If the volume has been modified, DoSyncChecks returns true to<br>
DSSyncWindowWithFile, which consequently calls the next three routines --<br>
HandleNameChange, HandleDirectoryChange, and HandleMoveToTrash.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 3. </b>DoSyncChecks
</p>
<pre>static Boolean DoSyncChecks(short aRefNum, WindowPtr aWindow)
{
   Boolean         doCheck = false;
   unsigned long   theLastDate, theDate;
   short          theVRefNum;
  
   if (aRefNum != 0) {
      DSGetWindowFileVRefNum(aWindow, &amp;theVRefNum);
      GetVolumeModDate(theVRefNum, &amp;theDate);
      DSGetWindowVLsBkUp(aWindow, &amp;theLastDate);
      if (theLastDate != theDate) {
         DSSetWindowVLsBkUp(aWindow, theDate);
         doCheck = true;
      }
    }
   return doCheck;
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>A FILE BY ANY OTHER NAME</b>
</p>
<p>
After determining that the volume containing the file has been modified,<br>
DSSyncWindowWithFile calls HandleNameChange (Listing 4). This simple routine<br>
compares the names of the window and the file; if they're not exactly the same, it<br>
updates the window to reflect the new filename. A minimal implementation of document<br>
synchronization might include only this routine.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you been wondering where the magical file management calls that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DoSyncChecks and HandleNameChange use come from -- for example,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetVolumeModDate and GetNameOfReferencedFile? See the file EvenMoreFiles.c<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the CD for details. This is my tribute to Jim Luther's excellent MoreFiles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collection. Whenever I need a routine that's not in the standard header, I write<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it and add it to the collection. Someday we'll be up to SonOfMoreFiles and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NightOfTheLivingMoreFiles.*
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 4. </b>HandleNameChange
</p>
<pre>void HandleNameChange(short aFRefNum, WindowPtr aWindow)
{
   Str255    theTitle, theName;
  
   GetWTitle(aWindow, theTitle);
   GetNameOfReferencedFile(aFRefNum, theName);
   if (!EqualString(theTitle, theName, true, true))
      SetWTitle(aWindow, theName);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>MOVING TO A NEW NEIGHBORHOOD</b>
</p>
<p>
After checking, and possibly synchronizing, the filename, DSSyncWindowWithFile<br>
calls HandleDirectoryChange (Listing 5) to see whether the file has been moved. This<br>
routine starts out by comparing the old parent directory to the new parent directory.<br>
If they're not the same, the file has been moved and the routine stores the file's new<br>
parent directory for later use by the application. It's possible that the file was moved<br>
to a parent for which the user doesn't have access privileges. In that case, a later Save<br>
will fail and revert to a Save As.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 5. </b>HandleDirectoryChange
</p>
<pre>void HandleDirectoryChange(short aFRefNum, WindowPtr aWindow)
{
   long       theOldParID, theNewParID;

   DSGetWindowFileParID(aWindow, &amp;theOldParID);
   GetFileParID(aFRefNum, &amp;theNewParID);
   if (theOldParID != theNewParID)
      DSSetWindowFileParID(aWindow, theNewParID);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>GETTING TRASHED</b>
</p>
<p>
Finally, DSSyncWindowWithFile calls HandleMoveToTrash (Listing 6) to see if the file<br>
is in the Trash. If it is, HandleMoveToTrash gets the FSSpec corresponding to the file<br>
reference number, which will be needed later. If the application is running in the<br>
background, and there are unsaved changes to the document, the routine notifies the<br>
user (with the Notification Manager) that the application needs assistance. While<br>
waiting for the user to respond to the request for assistance, HandleMoveToTrash<br>
handles events normally and also checks to see whether the user has moved the<br>
document back out of the Trash. After all, there's no sense in asking the user what to do<br>
about a file in the Trash if it's no longer there. If the user responds to the request, or<br>
moves the file out of the Trash while the application is still in the background,<br>
HandleMoveToTrash removes the notification. If the file is still in the Trash when the<br>
application becomes frontmost, an alert appears asking the user what to do.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 6.</b> HandleMoveToTrash
</p>
<pre>static void HandleMoveToTrash(short aFRefNum, WindowPtr aWindow,
      Boolean *inTrashCan)
{
   FSSpec         theFile;
   Boolean         inBackground;
   short            theResponse;
   EventRecord      theEvent;
  
   FileInTrashCan(aFRefNum, inTrashCan);
   if (*inTrashCan)
      GetFileSpec(aFRefNum, &amp;theFile);
   if ((aFRefNum != 0) &amp;&amp; *inTrashCan) {
      if (DSIsWindowDirty(aWindow)) {
         InBackground(&amp;inBackground);
         if (inBackground) {
            DSNotify();
            do {
               InBackground(&amp;inBackground);
               if ( WaitNextEvent(everyEvent, &amp;theEvent,
                      gSleepTime, nil))
                  DoEvent(&amp;theEvent);
               FileInTrashCan(aFRefNum, inTrashCan);
            } while (inBackground &amp;&amp; *inTrashCan);
            DSRemoveNotice();
         }
         if (*inTrashCan) {
            ParamText(theFile.name, "\p", "\p", "\p");
            theResponse = Alert(rCloseAlert, nil);
            switch (theResponse) {

               case kSave:
                  DoSave(aWindow);
                  /* Fall through */

               case kDontSave:
                  ZoomWindowToTrash(aWindow);
                  DoCloseCommand(aWindow);
                  break;
               case kPutAway:
                  DSAESendFinderFS(kAEFinderSuite, kAEPutAway,
                    &amp;theFile);
                  *inTrashCan = false;
                  break;
            }
         }
      } else    /* Window is clean; just close it */
         DoCloseCommand(aWindow);
   }
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Now if this were the Finder, there would be no question of what to do in this situation.<br>
When the user drags the icon for a folder to the Trash, the folder is essentially gone, so<br>
the associated window doesn't remain on the desktop. In the application world, life is a<br>
little more problematic. What happens if there are unsaved changes in the document?<br>
If the application blindly closes the document when the user drags the icon to the<br>
Trash, data could be lost. This would be a Bad Thing.
</p>
<p>
My mother always told me, "When in doubt, ask." So if there are unsaved changes to<br>
the file, an alert gives the user three choices: Don't Save, Remove From Trash, and<br>
Save. The Save and Don't Save options are simple: each closes the window as expected.<br>
Remove From Trash is a little tricky and takes advantage of the Scriptable Finder and<br>
Apple events.
</p>
<p>
The Remove From Trash case is similar to the Finder situation in which the user<br>
decides not to throw the document in the Trash and chooses Put Away from the File<br>
menu. HandleMoveToTrash handles this change of mind the same way the Finder handles<br>
it with Put Away: it sends the Finder a Put Away Apple event specifying the file in<br>
question as the target. (If the Scriptable Finder isn't available, the same action can be<br>
simulated manually; see the code on the CD for details.)
</p>
<h2>HOW CAN YOU BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE?</h2>
<p>
That's all there is to document synchronization. Now let's take a look at some other<br>
ways you can make your application's interface more consistent with the Finder's.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Many applications create a new window when an already open document is opened<br>
again in the Finder. But if the Finder were to open a second copy of a folder when you<br>
double-click the icon of a folder that's already open, wouldn't you be surprised? One of<br>
the guiding principles of human interface design is consistency; if your application<br>
doesn't perform the same action as the Finder (in this case, bring an already open<br>
window to the front), the user must learn and remember what will happen in each<br>
particular situation. This detracts from the user's happiness with your application.
</p>
<p>
Making your application notice that the document is already open is easy if you're<br>
using the document list. The following code would appear where you normally call your<br>
open-file routine. When the application receives an event to open a file, it checks to<br>
see if the file is already registered in the document list. If it's registered, the<br>
application simply brings it to the front instead of opening it again.
</p>
<pre>if (DSFileInDocumentList(aFile, &amp;theWindow))
   SelectWindow(theWindow);
else
   DoOpenFile(aFile);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>POP-UP NAVIGATION</h2>
<p>
A nifty feature introduced with the System 7 Finder is the pop-up menu in the title<br>
bar that allows the user to determine the location of an open folder and to navigate the<br>
file system without having to resort to browsing (see Figure 1). The user simply<br>
holds down the Command key and presses on the window title to see the menu. The<br>
computer knows where your document is; it just needs a good way to present the<br>
information. If you have Metrowerks CodeWarrior, you'll find that it does something<br>
similar to the System 7 Finder. Your application can provide the same interface.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/205.gif" width="338 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1. The Finder's pop-up navigation menu</b>
</p>
<p>
To provide a pop-up navigation menu for your document windows, replace the existing<br>
call to FindWindow in your mouse-down event handler with a call to the<br>
DSFindWindow routine. DSFindWindow is simply a wrapper for the Window Manager's<br>
FindWindow routine. If FindWindow returns inDrag, DSFindWindow does some<br>
additional checking to determine whether the window is frontmost, the Command key is<br>
down, and the mouse is in the window title area. If the mouse-down event meets these<br>
conditions, DSFindWindow calls DSPopUpNavigation, which implements the menu and<br>
returns inDesk as the window part, telling the application to ignore the click.
</p>
<p>
Note that DSPopUpNavigation makes an assumption about the location of the window's<br>
title that may not be true for nonstandard window types or in future versions of the<br>
system software. In such cases the pop-up menu will still work fine, though it may not<br>
be cosmetically correct. This is another area of the code that should be revisited when<br>
Copland becomes available.
</p>
<h2>CONSISTENCY PAYS OFF</h2>
<p>
Consistency is one of the key principles that make using the Macintosh the wonderful<br>
experience that it is. If your program responds to the user's actions in the same way<br>
that the Finder does -- in particular, maintaining the illusion that an icon and its<br>
window represent a single object -- your users can explore your application with<br>
skills they've already acquired. The techniques presented here show how to provide<br>
that extra measure of consistency with the Finder that keeps the Macintosh interface<br>
clean, consistent, and seamless. They're not too hard to implement, they're fun, and<br>
they just happen to be useful!
