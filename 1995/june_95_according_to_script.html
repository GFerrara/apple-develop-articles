<p>
The world of scripting is heating up. More and more developers are getting hip to<br>
scriptability, but they're discovering it's not a simple matter -- implementing<br>
scripting support in an application involves many complex issues. That's where this<br>
column comes in. 
</p>
<p>
My article, "Designing a Scripting Implementation," in the last issue of<i>develop</i> (Issue<br>
21) offered approaches you'll want to consider when designing your scripting<br>
implementation (your object model hierarchy and your human vocabulary), as well as<br>
some basic tips and guidelines for making your application scriptable. This column<br>
picks up where that article left off, elaborating on many of the same issues and<br>
providing further tips, tricks, and standards for scriptability. In this first<br>
installment of the column, I'll clarify a couple of points that some developers found<br>
confusing in the article; then I'll give some new guidelines.
</p>
<p>
<b>STARTING WITH MENU COMMANDS</b><br>
In my previous article, I suggested that one place to start your scripting<br>
implementation is to implement your menu commands. Permit me to clarify. Looking<br>
at menu commands is useful because they can suggest functionality that users should be<br>
able to script. But to maintain consistency with other object model-based applications,<br>
you should<i>not</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;implement scripting commands that simply mimic the menu commands.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Resist the temptation to fill up your dictionary with all your menu items, even though<br>
it might be easier to write your event handlers this way. Instead, implement the object<br>
model (discussed at length in "Apple Event Objects and You" in <i>develop</i> Issue 10 and<br>
"Better Apple Event Coding Through Objects" in Issue 12). Keep the number of verbs<br>
small, implement standard verbs wherever applicable, and let the script writer apply<br>
those verbs (especially <b>make</b>,<b> get</b>, and<b> set</b>) to a large number of objects. 
</p>
<p>
<b>LOWERCASING VERBS, TOO</b><br>
I mentioned in the last issue that you should begin all the terms in your dictionary<br>
(except for proper names) with lowercase letters. This applies not only to object<br>
names but to verbs as well. There are two reasons for this rule. First, AppleScript<br>
allows commands to be embedded within commands (particularly when the embedded<br>
command is from a scripting addition such as<b>choose file</b>), and these complex<br>
command statements read better when all the verbs are in lowercase. For example:
</p>
<pre>set myFile to choose file with prompt "Pick it!"</pre>
<p>
Second, if you were to include an entire suite (such as the Required or Core suite)<br>
from the system dictionary and then add your own verbs starting with uppercase,<br>
you'd end up having a mixture of verbs beginning withuppercase and those beginning<br>
with lowercase displayedin your dictionary, not a pretty picture.
</p>
<p>
<b>HANDLING REQUESTS TO GET AN OBJECT</b><br>
Developers are sometimes confused about how to handle a request from an Apple event<br>
or a script to get an object. In the early days, especially when programs were<br>
communicating directly with other programs, developers thought that getting an object<br>
meant returning the internal data structure of the object, such as a WindowRecord or<br>
other C structure. In today's scripting world, you&nbsp;&nbsp;should <i>never</i> return raw internal<br>
data structures. What you should return depends on the object or property requested. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Applications, windows, documents, and interface elements. </b> In most cases,<br>
when the object requested is an application, a window, a document, or an interface<br>
element (such as a button), you should return an error since you can't really bring<br>
these types of objects into your script. For example, <b>get window 1</b>should result in<br>
an error. One exception is that if your application is a script-controlled interface<br>
builder, you might want to return references to the windows, documents, and interface<br>
elements. 
</p>
<p>
You should provide a<b> contents</b> property for objects such as windows and documents.<br>
When this property is requested (as in <b>get the contents of window 1</b>), you should<br>
return the entire contents of the object specified,if appropriate. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Text elements. </b>When the object requested is a text element, such as a word or a<br>
character (as in <b>get word 4 of paragraph 3 of document "Sales"</b>), you should<br>
return the contents of the object itself as a string, such as "Fred" (word) or "x"<br>
(character).
</p>
<p>
<b>Graphics objects. </b>When the object requested is a simple graphics object where a<br>
standard format is in widespread use, you should return the contents of the object<br>
itself, just as for text elements. For example, for a PICT you would return the<br>
picture's data; for a point or a rectangle you would return a list of integers.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the<br>
object requested is a compound graphics object, such as a grouped graphic, you should<br>
return a reference to the object, in the form of an object specifier. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Cells, fields, and form elements. </b>You should provide a<b> value</b> property for<br>
objects such as cells in a spreadsheet, fields in a database, or elements of a form. (In<br>
essence, this property is the same thing as the <b>contents</b> property, but in natural<br>
language, people usually refer to the value of a cell or field and the contents of a<br>
window. Making a distinction between these two kinds of properties thus preserves a<br>
natural language style.) When this property is requested (for instance,<b>get the value</b><br>
<b>of cell 3 of row 7</b>), you should provide the content data for the object specified. If<br>
you want script writers to be able to get the value in more than one form, provide the<br>
<b>as</b> parameter (for example,<b>get the value of . . . as styled text</b>). 
</p>
<p>
<b>Rows, records, and entire forms. </b>When a row or column in a spreadsheet or<br>
table, a record in a database, or an entire form is requested, you can return a list of<br>
the data values in each field (for example,<b>get record 43 of database</b><br>
<b>"Employees"</b>might return {"Fred", 45.00}). However, it might be more appropriate<br>
to return a reference to the object, since the list might be too large or might contain<br>
large data. By the same token, either a list or a reference should be returned when the<br>
<b>current record</b> property that some developers have implemented is requested. 
</p>
<p>
<b>An object's internal data. </b>Rather than dealing with raw internal data structures,<br>
script writers should be able to get any piece of attribute data for an object through<br>
the object's properties, by using the <b>get &lt;property&gt;</b> construct. If you want to let<br>
them get all the attribute data at once with a single<b>get</b> command, provide a<br>
<b>properties</b> property (as, for example, QuarkXPress does), return a record with the<br>
values for all the properties, and provide a definition for the record as a new abstract<br>
class in the Type Definitions suite (discussed in my article in Issue 21).
</p>
<p>
As you can see, it's not always clear how to respond to an object request. While not a<br>
hard rule, the basic guideline is this: If an object is an elementary piece of data, such<br>
as a word or a rectangle, return its value directly; if it's a structure, such as a record<br>
or a row, return a list of its values or a reference to the structure; and if it's a<br>
complex or abstract object (especially part of the user interface like a window or a<br>
button), return either an error or a reference to the object. What you decide to return<br>
will often depend on the way you want script sentences to read.

<b>THE APPLICATION AS CONTAINER</b><br>
How to create and extract object specifiers from Apple events is explained in<i>Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh: Interapplication Communication</i> . The outermost container for an object<br>
specifier is always the application itself, represented by a container of type typeNull.<br>
A null container is the only proper way to specify the application level of the<br>
containment; do not include a cApplication object specifier as a container. Figure 1<br>
illustrates the rightway to specify the application as a container.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrong way in<br>
this case would be to have a third container level labeled cApplication between<br>
cDocument and cNull.

<b>I'M OUTTA SPACE</b><br>
Remember, everything you do in your event handlers, your object accessor functions,<br>
your error messages, and your dictionary will significantly affect the experience your<br>
users have in writing scripts. In future columns, I'll be discussing how to organize<br>
your dictionary; the increasingly crowded naming space for terms; how to organize and<br>
propose a new standard suite, event, or object definition; recording; and, as always,<br>
more tips, tricks, and conventions.
