&nbsp;This is a very forward-looking issue of <i> develop</i> .&nbsp;&nbsp;The cover article is on QuickDraw<br>
3D, whose final release won't have shipped by the time you read this (though it should<br>
be soon). We've also got articles on Copland and OpenDoc, which aren't due for final<br>
release for a while yet. You'll learn how Copland will take the Mac OS into the future<br>
and how OpenDoc will affect the way users work with documents. There's an article on<br>
creating PCI device drivers that will be -- as far as we can tell as of this writing --<br>
forward compatible with Copland. And we've got an article on the very subject of<br>
futures, a convenient way of implementing asynchronous interapplication<br>
communication, which will be especially valuable as more applications become<br>
scriptable and as component-oriented systems like OpenDoc become more prevalent.<br>
All in all, we're looking <i> ahead</i> .
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Having articles on technology that hasn't shipped yet makes it tough for us to give you<br>
solid information and code that we know will withstand the test of time and not change<br>
in the future. QuickDraw 3D is shipping soon enough that we know <i> that </i> article and its<br>
code are reasonably solid -- but the software is "beta" as of this writing, so changes<br>
can still happen. The Copland and OpenDoc articles provide only background<br>
information that should prove helpful as you consider how to use those technologies in<br>
your work; these articles provide no code, but only a context for the respective<br>
technologies. And although the PCI article does its best to tell you what may or may not<br>
work with Copland, there are limits to how far it can see into the future.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;While it's certainly atypical to have <i> develop </i> articles that aren't based on good, solid<br>
code, we felt these articles would nonetheless be of interest to you. We'd really like to<br>
know whether you agree with our decision. Our Review Board meetings are driven by<br>
what we think you want; we periodically need a reality check from you.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;There's yet another way that we're giving you a glimpse into the future: this issue's<br>
CD contains a Preliminary Drafts folder containing articles that we expect to<br>
publishin a future issue of<i>develop</i> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we didn't want to keep you from getting<br>
informationthat you might find useful. This time we've got an article on implementing<br>
multipane dialogs and another on performing timing operations. Look in this folder<br>
from now on for "extra" articles. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;So please, take a moment to give us your feedback on all of this (see the inside front<br>
cover to find out how to contact us). Why not stop by for a chat if you're at this year's<br>
Worldwide Developers Conference? Help us help you do a better job; that's why we're<br>
here. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Looking<i> forward</i> to hearing from you,

<b>CAROLINE ROSE </b>(AppleLink CROSE) has been writing and editing for so long that she<br>
can do it in her sleep. In fact, she sometimes lies awake at night trying to solve writing<br>
problems -- as she used to do for code bugs back when she was a programmer. To help<br>
get her mind off work, Caroline does Tai Chi and Ch'i Kung and curls up with her<br>
longtime feline companion, Cleo. But even then she can't get away from playing with<br>
words, as she continually adds to the long list of Cleo's nicknames; current favorites<br>
include Fuzz Bucket and The Purrmeister. Caroline agrees with Albert Schweitzer that<br>
there are two means of refuge from the miseries of life: music and cats. *
