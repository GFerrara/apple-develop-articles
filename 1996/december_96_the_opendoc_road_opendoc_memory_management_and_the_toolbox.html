<p>
OpenDoc has its own memory management system, but OpenDoc part editors also need<br>
to interact with the Macintosh Toolbox, which often does memory management using its<br>
own system. This column will point out potential pitfalls resulting from the<br>
interaction of these two systems, and suggest strategies to avoid them.
</p>
<p>
OpenDoc has adopted the well-tested Memory Manager from the MacApp and Bedrock<br>
frameworks for its own use. This memory manager was designed to provide fast and<br>
efficient memory allocation to the framework, and since OpenDoc's memory<br>
requirements are similar to those of a framework, it's natural for OpenDoc to reuse<br>
the code that has served the framework so well. The OpenDoc Memory Manager (as<br>
we'll call it here) is installed with OpenDoc as a shared library and handles most of the<br>
memory allocation and deallocation in an OpenDoc process.
</p>
<p>
There are several reasons for OpenDoc to have its own memory manager:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The OpenDoc Memory Manager can improve upon the memory manager of<br>
the underlying platform. On Macintosh 7.x systems, for instance, a faster and<br>
more space-efficient memory allocation algorithm replaces the one provided<br>
by the Macintosh Toolbox. In general, having a separate memory manager for<br>
OpenDoc allows the platform implementer to fine-tune OpenDoc performance.</li>
<li>The OpenDoc Memory Manager provides a cross-platform API for both<br>
platform implementers and part developers, covering both nonrelocatable and<br>
relocatable blocks. For platforms with no built-in relocatable blocks,<br>
platform implementers could provide relocatable blocks through the OpenDoc<br>
Memory Manager API without changing the underlying operating system.</li>
<li>The OpenDoc Memory Manager is packaged as a CFM shared library, so it<br>
can easily be replaced if a new version is required for improved performance<br>
or feature enhancements. Also, as Apple evolves the Mac OS and its memory<br>
manager, OpenDoc will adopt this new technology. Developers using the<br>
OpenDoc Memory Manager API will reap the benefits of the new system<br>
memory manager without modifying or even recompiling their part editors.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The OpenDoc Memory Manager defines a low-level procedural API, which is described<br>
in the "Memory Management" section of Appendix A in the <i>OpenDoc Cookbook</i>. An<br>
OpenDoc utility library named ODMemory (provided as source code) organizes the<br>
low-level API into high-level functions. The major difference between the underlying<br>
API and the "wrapper" ODMemory API is that the latter signals an exception when an<br>
error condition is encountered. For more on exception handling in OpenDoc, see<br>
"OpenDoc Exception Handling."

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OPENDOC EXCEPTION HANDLING</b>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handling exceptions in OpenDoc is a large topic, which will only be touched on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here. Readers should refer to the "Exception Handling" section of Appendix A in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the <i>OpenDoc Cookbook</i> for more details.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, OpenDoc allows developers to choose their own exception<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mechanisms while providing a convenient utility to enable these exception<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mechanisms to work with SOMobjects(TM) for Mac OS (the Apple<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementation of the IBM SOM(TM) technology), which underlies OpenDoc.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOM propagates exceptions through the environment parameter (commonly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known as the ev parameter). It's illegal to throw an exception out of a SOM<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;method. Instead, the exception code should be stuffed into the ev parameter and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returned to the caller. The caller should examine the ev parameter to see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether an error has been signaled in the called function. Since this checking<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needs to be done after every SOM method invocation, OpenDoc provides a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;utility to automatically check the ev parameter. If an error has been signaled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the utility will use the chosen exception mechanism (through the use of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;macros) to propagate the exception.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The macros for the SOM exception handlers are prefixed with "SOM_":<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOM_TRY, SOM_CATCH_ALL, and SOM_ENDTRY. These macros should not be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confused with TRY, CATCH_ALL, and ENDTRY. The non-SOM exception handler<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;macros do not propagate the exception automatically unless RERAISE is called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explicitly in the catch block, and they can't be used to propagate an exception<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;across a SOM boundary.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;______________________________
</p>
<p>
To ensure optimum usage of memory, part developers should use the OpenDoc Memory<br>
Manager API or the ODMemory utility library to satisfy their memory needs. The only<br>
exception is when the part editor is interacting with a Toolbox manager that requires<br>
memory to be allocated in a certain memory heap. We'll go into more detail about this<br>
in a moment.
</p>


<h2>HOW THE OPENDOC MEMORY MANAGER WORKS</h2>
<p>
The OpenDoc Memory Manager allocates fixed-sized, nonrelocatable blocks of memory<br>
and organizes them into heaps. The memory allocated for these heaps may come from<br>
the application heap, temporary memory, or the system heap. These memory blocks<br>
(called <i>allocation segments</i>) are subdivided into smaller memory blocks as memory<br>
requests are made by OpenDoc objects and part editors. When MMAllocate or ODNewPtr<br>
is called to allocate a block of memory, the OpenDoc Memory Manager returns a<br>
pointer to one of these memory blocks in an allocation segment.
</p>
<p>
When an OpenDoc process is started up, the OpenDoc Memory Manager allocates a<br>
small amount of memory for a heap, which becomes the default heap. Clients of the<br>
OpenDoc Memory Manager can create extra heaps and make any of these the default<br>
heap.
</p>
<p>
If a new block is requested and no allocation segments have enough free space to satisfy<br>
the request, the OpenDoc Memory Manager will trigger the creation of another<br>
allocation segment, which has the effect of growing the heap. Similarly, when all<br>
blocks in an allocation segment are freed, the segment is freed as well, shrinking the<br>
heap.
</p>
<p>
The OpenDoc Memory Manager and ODMemory utility also provide a way to allocate<br>
relocatable blocks. These blocks are not suballocated from the allocation segments;<br>
instead, the OpenDoc Memory Manager allocates them directly from the same operating<br>
system heap zone that the OpenDoc heap allocates segments from.
</p>


<h2>MEMORY PARTITION</h2>
<p>
Typically, several OpenDoc part editors run in the single process associated with a<br>
document. There's no way to determine how many part editors are going to be used in a<br>
document and how much memory each part editor requires. Therefore, it's impossible<br>
to know how big the memory partition of the process should be before opening the<br>
OpenDoc document. As described above, the OpenDoc Memory Manager has its own<br>
allocation scheme, which is not limited by the application partition, so the memory<br>
partition becomes less significant. (Currently the default heap is allocated from<br>
temporary memory, but this may change in the future.) The elimination of the need<br>
for the end user to understand the concept of application heap and adjust the memory<br>
partition is one of the design goals of OpenDoc.
</p>
<p>
However, users familiar with OpenDoc might remember that the Document Info dialog<br>
allows them to change the partition size of the process. You might ask, "If the OpenDoc<br>
Memory Manager does what it claims to, why do I need to adjust the memory<br>
partition?"
</p>
<p>
Even though most of the memory allocation is done through the OpenDoc Memory<br>
Manager, Toolbox managers do allocate memory in the application heap, and the amount<br>
required varies considerably depending on the size of the data manipulated and the<br>
operations performed. Changing the memory partition is needed to accommodate these<br>
cases.
</p>
<p>
When a document is created, it's opened into a process of a default size. Users can<br>
change the default size for the document by using the Document Info dialog. There's also<br>
a desktop utility called Infinity OpenDoc Sizer that's capable of changing either the<br>
partition size of a particular document (without first having to open it) or the default<br>
partition size used by all documents that don't already have custom partitions. It's<br>
available in the Developer Release area of the OpenDoc Web site<br>
(http://www.opendoc.apple.com) and accompanies this column on this issue's CD and<br>
<i>develop</i>'s Web site.
</p>


<h2>MANAGING TOOLBOX MEMORY ALLOCATIONS</h2>
<p>
As your code makes calls into the Macintosh Toolbox, you'll find several places where<br>
the Toolbox allocates memory for you. Generally, this memory is allocated out of the<br>
current heap, which is usually the application heap. Since the size of an OpenDoc<br>
document's application heap is limited (the default heap size leaves only about 100K of<br>
space free after OpenDoc itself is loaded), you need to be careful when calling Toolbox<br>
routines that allocate in that heap. With some care, you can control your allocations so<br>
that your users won't have to increase your document's heap size in order to use your<br>
part.
</p>
<p>
When you're dealing with resources in particular, there are a few techniques you can<br>
use to handle memory allocations. Standard resource access routines such as<br>
GetResource will generally cause the associated memory to be allocated in the<br>
application heap. If you're using a resource for only a short period of time and it's<br>
fairly small, you can continue to use these routines to access it and load it into the<br>
application heap.
</p>
<p>
For larger resources, however, this won't work. Luckily, OpenDoc provides the utility<br>
library UseRsrcM to help, as described in the "Resource Handling" section of Appendix<br>
A in the <i>OpenDoc Cookbook</i>. The utility routine ODReadResource allows you to load<br>
resources from your part's shared library file into temporary memory. This works<br>
by determining the size of the resource, allocating a relocatable block of this size in<br>
temporary memory, and using ReadPartialResource to load the resource directly into<br>
that block. (Note, however, that resources read in by ODReadResource are detached;<br>
you cannot, for instance, call ChangedResource to write out modifications to them.<br>
Also, each call to ODReadResource will return a new copy of the resource.) If you need<br>
to access large resources from files other than your part -- for instance, for a<br>
sound-editing part that needs to load an 'snd ' resource from another file -- you can<br>
use this same technique yourself. A part editor must also ensure that its resource file<br>
is in the resource chain before accessing its resources (see "Resource File Access").
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;______________________________
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESOURCE FILE ACCESS</b>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an OpenDoc environment, parts must share access to system services that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applications normally own exclusively. This adds some complications to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;programming model you're probably used to.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such shared service is the resource chain. Since there are potentially<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many parts all working in the active document, the resource chain must be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shared between them. Also, because OpenDoc parts are shared libraries, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resources in your part's file aren't automatically available like those in an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The utility library UseRsrcM facilitates making your resource file available<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and accessing resources from it. To open and initialize access to your shared<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;library's resource file, you call InitLibraryResources from your CFM<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initialization routine. You also call CloseLibraryResources from your CFM<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;termination routine to close the resource file when you're done with it.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To access a resource from your part's shared library, you must first call<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BeginUsingLibraryResources. This adds the part's resource file to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resource chain and sets the top of the chain to that file (so that calls such as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get1Resource will retrieve resources from the correct file). After reading or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writing the necessary resource, you call EndUsingLibraryResources to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the file from the resource chain. For C++ users, a stack-based class<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;named CUsingLibraryResources is provided to do this for you automatically.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple of implications about using this mechanism for handling the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resource chain. Because Resource Manager routines are available only inside a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin.../End... block, you must make sure your code and the Toolbox aren't<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trying to manipulate resources at other times. You also have to be careful that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LoadResource isn't called on a purged resource from a file that's not in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chain.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other things, such as icons or Balloon Help in menus (which are loaded while<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the menu is pulled down and the part isn't in control), can also cause<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problems. If you understand the relationship between your resource file and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the resource chain, however, you can work around these potential pitfalls.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;______________________________
</p>
<p>
There are times when the Toolbox loads resources for you. In these cases, you<br>
generally can't get them to be loaded into temporary memory. In several cases, the<br>
resources are small or are allocated for only a short time, so there isn't much to<br>
worry about. For instance, when accessing resources such as string lists ('STR#'),<br>
cursors, and icon families, you can continue to use the normal Toolbox routines. In<br>
these cases, the resource is often accessed once and left around in memory. Therefore,<br>
you'll want to make sure these resources are marked as purgeable so that they can be<br>
deallocated automatically when more space is needed.
</p>
<p>
There are other times when larger resources (such as pictures) are being accessed<br>
and problems can crop up where you might not expect them. For instance, if you have a<br>
large picture that's referenced by a dialog item (like that 24-bit rendered image for<br>
the background of your About box) and there isn't sufficient memory available when<br>
the dialog is displayed, the picture won't be shown. One solution to this is to create<br>
your own heap zone, as discussed later. Another is to create a user item procedure for<br>
the picture, handling the memory allocation and spooling in of the picture yourself.
</p>
<p>
For resources such as menus and definition procedures (WDEFs, CDEFs, and MDEFs),<br>
there is little you can safely do. Most of these types of resources, although they persist<br>
for a long time, are fairly small, so having them allocated in the application heap isn't<br>
terrible.
</p>
<p>
Another commonly used piece of memory allocated by the Toolbox, but in this case not<br>
resource-based, is a region. If you're doing many region operations and the regions<br>
aren't being kept around, you can continue to use NewRgn to allocate them in the<br>
application heap. However, if you're keeping regions around for long periods of time,<br>
there's an ODMemory utility routine, ODNewRgn, that you can call to allocate your<br>
regions from the OpenDoc heap.
</p>


<h2>OTHER TECHNIQUES TO KEEP ALLOCATIONS OUT OF THE<br>
APPLICATION HEAP</h2>
<p>
In some cases, the Toolbox allows you to specify that a memory allocation come from<br>
temporary memory rather than the application heap. Probably the most common<br>
example of this is a GWorld. Passing the useTempMem flag to NewGWorld or<br>
UpdateGWorld will cause it to allocate the PixMap's buffer in temporary memory<br>
rather than in the application heap. Use these opportunities when they present<br>
themselves.
</p>
<p>
Also, if you're allowed to specify the location of memory used by the Toolbox, such as<br>
for the WindowRecord in calls to NewWindow and the sound channel in SndNewChannel,<br>
you should take these opportunities to allocate the memory with ODNewPtr rather than<br>
allowing the Toolbox to do the allocation.
</p>
<p>
Another technique that you might consider for dealing with large or long-term<br>
resources is loading them into the system heap. This can be done by setting the "system<br>
heap" flag in the resources' attributes. This has the advantage of being easy to do and<br>
working even for resources allocated by the Toolbox. The disadvantage is that<br>
increasing the system heap's size can be bad for performance if virtual memory is<br>
enabled. Since the system heap is always paged into real memory space in System 7, a<br>
large system heap means there isn't much space in RAM available for paging in the<br>
rest of memory.
</p>
<p>
Yet another technique that can sometimes be useful is to create your own heap zone. To<br>
do this, create a block in temporary memory using ODNewHandle, lock it, and create a<br>
heap inside it by calling InitZone. This technique shouldn't be used for just any<br>
allocation, but only if other methods don't work and if the allocation is ephemeral. One<br>
example we mentioned before where this might be useful is for a dialog box with large<br>
picture items. Note that you'll have to make sure the heap is large enough to hold not<br>
only the pictures but also the other dialog-related resources, and you'll want to leave<br>
some room to spare. Also, you probably wouldn't want to have more than one of these<br>
heaps allocated at a time. When locking <i>any</i> handle in temporary memory, make sure<br>
you unlock it again as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
Other parts of the Mac OS, such as QuickTime, will require you to use these and other<br>
techniques to deal effectively with memory. (In the case of QuickTime, you can use<br>
SetZone to switch to the system heap.) In such cases, it's a good idea to use a tool such<br>
as Metrowerks' ZoneRanger to examine memory allocated in the application heap and,<br>
if problems are found, look for ways to move allocations elsewhere.
</p>


<h2>MEMORY MATTERS</h2>
<p>
In the future, a new system memory manager will allow for heaps that can grow. When<br>
this becomes available, many of these contortions will become unnecessary. In the<br>
meantime, however, it's important to remember that you're sharing the application<br>
heap with other clients and to act accordingly.
