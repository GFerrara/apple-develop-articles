<h1>GRAPHICAL TRUFFLES: The Display Manager</h1>

<p>
A major change is taking place on the screen, which your application might not even<br>
know about! With the help of the Display Manager, the user can use the Monitors<br>
control panel to rearrange displays, make resolution switches, add or remove a<br>
display, and move the menu bar from one display to another -- all without rebooting.<br>
However, the ease of changing a display for the user poses new challenges for the<br>
developer if an application relies on a graphics device's bounding rectangle to position,<br>
zoom, and grow its windows.
</p>
<p>
To meet this challenge, the Display Manager provides several new functions that make<br>
it easier to gather information about the display environment and implement changes.<br>
I'll describe some of the more commonly used functions in this column. I'll also discuss<br>
how to use a notification event to find out when a display has changed (an example is<br>
included on this issue's CD).
</p>
<p>
Two versions of the Display Manager are currently implemented in the system<br>
software. The information in this column applies to both versions. Display Manager<br>
version 1.0 is available on all PowerPC(TM) processor-based Macintosh computers<br>
and Color QuickDraw-capable Macintosh computers running System 7.5. Display<br>
Manager 2.0 is available on PCI-based computers running System 7.5.2. To determine<br>
whether the Display Manager is available, call Gestalt with the selector<br>
gestaltDisplayMgrAttr and check the gestaltDisplayMgrPresent bit of the response. To<br>
determine which version you have, call Gestalt with the selector<br>
gestaltDisplayMgrVers.
</p>
<h2>MORE FUNCTIONS, LESS CODE</h2>
<p>
The Display Manager includes several new functions that greatly simplify tasks that<br>
used to take a lot of code. For example, many applications need to query screen devices<br>
for bounding rectangles, pixel depths, and a variety of other things. Prior to the<br>
Display Manager, an application could use the GetDeviceList function to retrieve the<br>
first graphics device record in the device list and call GetNextDevice for subsequent<br>
devices in the list. The application would then need to use the Device Manager to<br>
determine whether the device was a screen device and whether it was active. With the<br>
Display Manager, you can do all this with two functions: DMGetFirstScreenDevice and<br>
DMGetNextScreenDevice.
</p>
<pre>GDHandle      aDevice;

aDevice =
   DMGetFirstScreenDevice(dmOnlyActiveDisplays);
while (aDevice != nil) {
   // Do something with the device.
   ...
   // Get the next device in the list.
   aDevice = DMGetNextScreenDevice(aDevice,
                        dmOnlyActiveDisplays);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The Display Manager also introduces two functions that make it easier to retrieve<br>
information about the attached displays and to change their characteristics:<br>
DMCheckDisplayMode and DMSetDisplayMode.
</p>
<p>
DMCheckDisplayMode determines whether a specific display mode and pixel depth are<br>
supported by the supplied graphics device. (A display mode is a combination of several<br>
interrelated display characteristics, such as resolution and scan timing.) This<br>
function has two output parameters: modeOk and switchFlags. If the Boolean modeOk<br>
parameter is true, the screen device supports the requested display mode. The<br>
switchFlags parameter contains two flag bits that should be checked with the constants<br>
kNoSwitchConfirmBit and kDepthNotAvailableBit.
</p>
<ul>
<li>    If kNoSwitchConfirmBit isn't set, the requested mode is an optional<br>
mode and is only shown in the mode list of the Monitors control panel when the<br>
Option key is pressed (an optional mode requires confirmation from the user<br>
before it's allowed).</li>
<li> kDepthNotAvailableBit indicates whether the requested pixel depth is<br>
available with the requested display mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once your application knows that the requested display mode and pixel depth are<br>
available, you can use the DMSetDisplayMode function to reconfigure the video display.<br>
If you pass 0 for the mode parameter, the Display Manager uses the device's current<br>
display mode.
</p>
<p>
If you like to change the display mode and pixel depth often, you can save the<br>
configuration and retrieve it at startup with the DMSaveScreenPrefs function. This<br>
function requires three parameters, which all take the value of NULL since they're<br>
private to the Display Manager. (Go figure.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Identifying displays.</b> Many of the Display Manager functions require a display ID<br>
(type DisplayIDType) as a parameter. A display ID is a long integer that uniquely<br>
identifies a screen display. Affiliating a display ID with a graphics device can be useful<br>
in cases where the graphics device might change or isn't available. You can obtain a<br>
display ID with the function DMGetDisplayIDByGDevice, which requires a graphics<br>
device as a parameter. Or you can retrieve the graphics device corresponding to a<br>
given display ID by calling DMGetGDeviceByDisplayID. Both functions require the<br>
Boolean parameter failToMain.
</p>
<ul>
<li>    If you set failToMain to true and the routine can't find what it's looking<br>
for (either the graphics device or the display ID), the routine returns<br>
information about the main graphics device rather than returning an error.</li>
<li> If you set failToMain to false and the routine can't find what it's looking<br>
for, it will return kDMDisplayNotFoundErr. (For example, when a PowerBook<br>
goes to sleep, the display might be removed.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>KEEPING UP WITH THE CHANGES</h2>
<p>
Now that the user is able to change a screen display without restarting, your<br>
application may want to reposition and resize its windows, update internal<br>
display-related data structures, or update nonstandard window definitions on the fly.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If desired, the Display Manager can automatically adjust the positions of the windows<br>
that were onscreen before the change to keep them onscreen after the change, but it<br>
may not put them in the best possible positions. However, if you want to reposition and<br>
resize your windows yourself, you need to set the isDisplayManagerAware flag in your<br>
application's SIZE resource and install a callback procedure or an Apple event handler<br>
in your application so that you'll know when a display has changed.
</p>
<p>
Your application registers a callback procedure with the Display Manager function<br>
DMRegisterNotifyProc. The display notification procedure takes a Display Notice Apple<br>
event parameter describing the changes that were made to the display. The notification<br>
callback is especially useful for control panels and other instances where high-level<br>
event handling in an event loop isn't possible. Another benefit of the notification<br>
callback is that your application is informed on a more timely basis than through a<br>
high-level event, thus giving the appearance of seamless integration with the Display<br>
Manager.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>If you're using Display Manager 1.0,</b> you're not notified about depth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changes, and A5 isn't restored when you receive the notification callback.*
</p>
<p>
You can also receive and process Display Notice events through an Apple event handler.<br>
Display Notice event handlers are installed like any other Apple event handlers, with<br>
the AEInstallEventHandler function:
</p>
<pre>err = AEInstallEventHandler(kCoreEventClass,
   kAESystemConfigNotice,
   NewAEEventHandlerProc(DoAEDisplayConfigChange),
   0, false);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To enable high-level events in your application, you need to set the<br>
isHighLevelEventAware flag in the SIZE resource. (You'll also need to support the<br>
required Apple events described in <i>Inside Macintosh: Interapplication</i><br>
<i>Communication.</i>)
</p>
<p>
Whether your application uses a notification callback or a high-level event handler, a<br>
Display Notice Apple event is passed to your routine. You can obtain a list of descriptor<br>
records (an AEDescList) from the Display Notice event with the AEGetParamDesc<br>
function. Each descriptor record holds two additional keyword-specific descriptor<br>
records:
</p>
<ul>
<li>    keyDisplayOldConfig, which is a record of the display's previous state</li>
<li> keyDisplayNewConfig, which is a record of the display's current state</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can obtain these records one at a time with the function AEGetNthDesc.
</p>
<p>
To move and resize your application's windows, you need to know which graphics<br>
device was affected, the old and new bounding rectangles of the device, and possibly the<br>
pixel depth. All the information about the affected graphics device can be obtained from<br>
the descriptor list with keyword-specific descriptor constants, which are defined in<br>
the Displays.h universal header file. You call AEGetKeyPtr with the various descriptor<br>
constants to extract the information you need. In particular, the constant<br>
keyDeviceRect extracts the bounding rectangle, and keyDisplayID extracts the display<br>
ID. As previously mentioned, you can convert a display ID to a graphics device with the<br>
function DMGetGDeviceByDisplayID.
</p>
<p>
Listing 1 shows an example of what to do after receiving a Display Notice event from a<br>
notification callback or a high-level event handler.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1.</b> Handling the Display Notice event
</p>
<pre>OSErr HandleNotification(AppleEvent *event)
{
   OSErr           err;
   GrafPtr         oldPort;
   AEDescList      displayList, aDisplay;
   AERecord        oldConfig, newConfig;
   AEKeyword       tempWord;
   DisplayIDType   displayID;
   unsigned long   returnType;
   long            count;
   Rect            oldRect, newRect;

   GetPort(&amp;oldPort);

   // Get a list of the displays from the Display Notice Apple event.
   err = AEGetParamDesc(event, kAEDisplayNotice, typeWildCard,
             &amp;DisplayList);

   // How many items in the list?
   err = AECountItems(&amp;displayList, &amp;count);

   while (count &gt; 0) {
      // Loop through the list.
      err = AEGetNthDesc(&amp;displayList, count, typeWildCard,
               &amp;tempWord, &amp;aDisplay);

      // Get the old rect.
      err = AEGetNthDesc(&amp;aDisplay, 1, typeWildCard, &amp;tempWord,
               &amp;oldConfig);
      err = AEGetKeyPtr(&amp;oldConfig, keyDeviceRect, typeWildCard,
               &amp;returnType, &amp;oldRect, 8, nil);

      // Get the display ID so that we can get the GDevice later.
      err = AEGetKeyPtr(&amp;oldConfig, keyDisplayID, typeWildCard,
               &amp;returnType, &amp;displayID, 8, nil);

      // Get the new rect.
      err = AEGetNthDesc(&amp;aDisplay, 2, typeWildCard, &amp;tempWord,
               &amp;newConfig);
      err = AEGetKeyPtr(&amp;newConfig, keyDeviceRect, typeWildCard,
               &amp;returnType, &amp;newRect, 8, nil);

      // If the new and old rects are not the same, we can assume
      // that the GDevice has changed, and the windows need to be
      // rearranged.
      if (err == noErr &amp;&amp; !EqualRect(&amp;newRect, &amp;oldRect))
         HandleDeviceChange(displayID, &amp;newRect);

      count--;
      err = AEDisposeDesc(&amp;aDisplay);
      err = AEDisposeDesc(&amp;oldConfig);
      err = AEDisposeDesc(&amp;newConfig);
   }

   err = AEDisposeDesc(&amp;displayList);
   SetPort(oldPort);

   return err;

<h2>WHAT TO DO NOW</h2>
<p>
The sample code on this issue's CD should provide a starting point for how to handle<br>
display notification events in your application. Additional documentation and sample<br>
code for the Display Manager are provided in the Display Manager Development Kit,<br>
which is also on the CD.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Mac OS Software Developer's Kit</b> incudes the Display Manager<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development Kit along with a lot of other development software. The Mac<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSSDK is now part of the Developer CD Series (included in the Apple<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developer Mailing, which is available through the Apple Developer Catalog).*
</p>
<p>
To learn more about what the Display Manager can do for you, you should also take a<br>
look at the Displays.h universal header file.
</p>
<p>
Now there's no excuse for your application to be in the dark about changes taking place<br>
on the screen. So why not keep your users happy and take advantage of the help that the<br>
Display Manager can give you?
