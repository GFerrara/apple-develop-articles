<i style="font-size:125%;">You've helped create an Apple Guide guide for your standalone</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">application. Now your company is writing an OpenDoc part editor,</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">but it's not obvious how Apple Guide can be used in the context of</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">parts and compound documents. The answer is Apple Guide 2.1,</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">which extends the original version to allow easy use of Apple</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">Guide features, including Help menu management, coachmarks, and</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">context checks, in the world of OpenDoc. This article introduces</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">the new features of Apple Guide 2.1 and explains in detail how to</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">use them with OpenDoc.</i>
</p>
<p>
The world of OpenDoc isn't like the world of the standalone "behemoth" application --<br>
a fact that hasn't escaped the notice of developers who want to provide online help. An<br>
application developer can easily provide complete online help since the application is a<br>
single self-contained unit that will run in its own window. On the other hand, the<br>
developer of an OpenDoc part editor never knows what other part editors will be<br>
running along with it during an OpenDoc session. Users can have any number of part<br>
editors running in any number of windows at the same time. All the editors might<br>
belong to a package written by one company, or, more likely, it might be a<br>
conglomeration written by a number of different companies. Under these<br>
circumstances, providing help gets a little more complicated.
</p>
<p>
Since Apple Guide is such a powerful help system, wouldn't it be nice if it could be<br>
applied to the new world of OpenDoc? Enter Apple Guide 2.1 (released right on the<br>
heels of Cyberdog, Apple's new integrated suite of OpenDoc part editors for the<br>
Internet). The raison d'&amp;ecirc;tre of Apple Guide 2.1 is to support Apple Guide for<br>
OpenDoc, with particular emphasis on Cyberdog. This version includes a number of<br>
new features, some of which are specific to OpenDoc and some of which aren't. Among<br>
these new features are the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a combined Full Access window (known as a Merged Access window) that<br>
contains all the guide topic areas and index terms for OpenDoc part editors<br>
currently running</li>
<li>a similar ability to merge guides in conventional applications</li>
<li>the ability to specify a list of applications for which a particular guide is<br>
intended</li>
<li>support for a whole new series of OpenDoc-related context checks</li>
</ul>
<p>
In this article, I'll describe how Apple Guide behavior has changed in the world of<br>
OpenDoc, and I'll also tell you about some new features of Apple Guide 2.1 that you can<br>
use in conventional applications. I'll go over the simple steps you must take to add a<br>
guide to an OpenDoc part editor, and then I'll cover some of the things you could do,<br>
depending on the kinds of help you want to provide for your part editor. You'll find<br>
samples of the resources mentioned in the article on this issue's CD.
</p>
<p>
If you haven't worked with Apple Guide before, you might want to read "Giving Users<br>
Help With Apple Guide" in develop Issue 18 before tackling the new concepts presented<br>
here. Apple Guide Complete is the definitive reference, though the current (1995)<br>
edition doesn't cover Apple Guide 2.1.

<h2>HOW APPLE GUIDE BUILDS THE HELP MENU</h2>
<p>
From the beginning, one of the strengths of Apple Guide has been that it enables guide<br>
authors to create guides without requiring modification of the application being guided.<br>
While most other new Toolbox managers were saying, "To support me, just add a<br>
NewManagerIdle call in your main event loop," Apple Guide said simply, "I work just<br>
fine without any modifications to your application at all!" One of the key elements<br>
enabling Apple Guide to work without requiring changes to any code is Apple Guide's<br>
automatic population of the Help menu.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Help menu has also been called the Guide menu at certain times in its<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;history, but both names refer to the same menu (the one labeled with a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question mark).
</p>
<p>
The algorithm Apple Guide uses to determine how to populate the Help menu, although<br>
simple on the surface, has a number of subtleties. With each new release, the<br>
algorithm has been extended somewhat. To understand how the Help menu is populated<br>
in Apple Guide 2.1, let's look at how the population algorithm has developed over time.<br>
You Apple Guide experts might even discover some little-known features.
</p>
<p>
Table 1 presents a summary of how the different versions of Apple Guide populate the<br>
Help menu; details follow.
</p>
<p>
<b>How populating the Help menu has evolved</b>
</p>
<p>
Original Apple Guide
</p>
<ul>
<li>Guide files in application's folder.</li>
<li>Based on (App Creator), (Gestalt), 'QLfy'.</li>
<li>Based on type [About, Tutorial, Help, Shortcuts, Othr]. There can be only<br>
one guide file of each type except Other.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Apple Guide 2.0
</p>
<ul>
<li>Add guide files in Global Guide Files folder.</li>
<li>No changes.</li>
<li>Guide files in application's folder take precedence over those in Global<br>
Guide Files folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Apple Guide 2.1
</p>
<ul>
<li>For OpenDoc shell documents, change application's folder to mean<br>
document's folder.</li>
<li>Add an exclusion check based on resources of type 'prts' [for OpenDoc] and<br>
'apsg' [for applications].</li>
<li>Multiprocess guide files ['prts' for OpenDoc, 'mlti' for others], if<br>
present, are accessed through the "<b><i>ProcessName</i></b> Guide" item in the Help<br>
type menu position. Guide files with the 'apsg' resource appear in the Help<br>
menus of multiple applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> All candidates are determined when the Help menu is built. Exclusions are<br>
applied at the time the menu is built, except for the 'prts' resource test, which is<br>
applied when Apple Guide is launched.
</p>

<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>"ORIGINAL" APPLE GUIDE</b>
</p>
<p>
The general process of populating the Help menu hasn't changed since Apple Guide was<br>
first introduced. At application launch time, Apple Guide does the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>creates a list of possible guide file candidates</li>
<li>excludes any candidates that don't match required criteria</li>
<li>puts the names of all remaining guide files in their requested positions in<br>
the Help menu</li>
</ul>
<p>
For the original version of Apple Guide (any version before Apple Guide 2.0), the list<br>
of candidates is created by searching for all guide files that are in the same folder as<br>
the application being launched and that aren't Mixin guide files (see Apple Guide<br>
Complete, page 2-14, for details about Mixin guide files). A guide file with an alias in<br>
the application's folder would also be added to the list of candidates.
</p>
<p>
Apple Guide then sees if any candidates should be excluded by subjecting them to these<br>
tests:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the guide file contains an &lt;App Creator&gt; command specifying a value<br>
that doesn't match the signature of the current application, it's excluded (see<br>
Apple Guide Complete, page 10-8).</li>
<li>If the guide file specifies one or more &lt;Gestalt&gt; checks and no &lt;Gestalt&gt;<br>
selector returns its required value, the guide file is excluded (see Apple Guide<br>
Complete, page 10-10).</li>
<li>If the guide file specifies exactly one &lt;Gestalt&gt; check whose selector is<br>
'QLfy', Apple Guide looks in the guide file's resource fork for a resource of<br>
type 'QLfy' with a resource ID equal to the requiredValue parameter of the<br>
&lt;Gestalt&gt; command. If it finds such a resource, it assumes it's a 680x0 code<br>
resource that takes no parameters and returns a short in register D0<br>
(standard C calling conventions). It calls the resource code and, if the result is<br>
0, the guide file is excluded (see develop Issue 18, page 19).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Apple Guide then tries to place the name of each remaining candidate in the position it<br>
requested with the helpType parameter of the &lt;Help Menu&gt; command (see Apple Guide<br>
Complete, page 10-14). Placement of the names of different types of guide files is<br>
shown in Figure 1. If two or more final candidate guide files have the same type and<br>
that type isn't Other, Apple Guide includes the name of the first guide file of that type<br>
(by alphabetical order) and excludes the others. The names of all guide files of type<br>
Other appear in the Help menu.

<p>
<b>APPLE GUIDE 2.0</b>
</p>
<p>
Apple Guide 2.0 (an update to System 7.5 but backward-compatible with System 7 and<br>
7.1) added some logic to the Help menu population algorithm that hasn't been widely<br>
documented. The crux was adding a new place to look for candidate guide files, called the<br>
Global Guide Files folder. The Global Guide Files folder resides in the Extensions folder<br>
and, as its name suggests, is a place where you can put guide files to make them<br>
available to all applications.
</p>
<p>
When Apple Guide 2.0 is creating its list of candidate guide files for an application, it<br>
looks both in the folder containing the application and in the Global Guide Files folder.<br>
When looking to exclude candidates, Apple Guide 2.0 works almost exactly like the<br>
original Apple Guide -- it excludes any guide files from its candidate list that don't<br>
pass the &lt;App Creator&gt;, &lt;Gestalt&gt;, and 'QLfy' tests.
</p>
<p>
The only difference is in how Apple Guide 2.0 selects an item for the Help menu if<br>
there are multiple candidates. In the original Apple Guide, if two guide files passed all<br>
the tests and were of the same type (aside from type Other), the one sorting first<br>
alphabetically would be chosen for inclusion. In Apple Guide 2.0, if there are two or<br>
more guide files of the same type, the first one alphabetically is still chosen for<br>
inclusion, but any guide file in the application's folder is chosen over any guide file in<br>
the Global Guide Files folder. So, for example, if there are Tutorial guide files in the<br>
application's folder and also in the Global Guide Files folder, those in the Global Guide<br>
Files folder will be ignored, and the one that's first alphabetically in the application's<br>
folder will be chosen for inclusion. Names of guide files of type Other are added from<br>
both the application folder and the Global Guide Files folder.
</p>
<p>
<b>APPLE GUIDE 2.1</b>
</p>
<p>
Apple Guide 2.1 adds two new mechanisms to the process of building the Help menu:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to define multiprocess guide files (with an 'mlti' or a 'prts'<br>
resource) and to access these files as a group through a single menu item that<br>
presents the user with a combined Full Access window (available in both<br>
OpenDoc part editors and conventional applications)</li>
<li>the ability to specify a list of application signatures that your guide<br>
supports (with an 'apsg' resource), so that the name of your guide will appear<br>
in the Help menu for each of those applications</li>
</ul>
<p>
We'll look at these new mechanisms in more detail in the next section.
</p>
<p>
In addition, Apple Guide 2.1 supports document-specific help. Recall that when<br>
creating a list of candidate guide files, Apple Guide 2.0 looks in the same folder as the<br>
application and in the Global Guide Files folder. Apple Guide 2.1 behaves exactly the<br>
same way for conventional applications, but for OpenDoc documents launched via the<br>
OpenDoc shell application, Apple Guide 2.1 treats the document's folder as the<br>
"application's folder," so it looks in the same folder as the document for guide files,<br>
rather than in the same folder as the OpenDoc shell application (besides searching the<br>
Global Guide Files folder). As a result, the names of guide files in the same folder as<br>
the OpenDoc shell application never appear in the Help menu; the names of guide files<br>
in the same folder as an OpenDoc document can appear in the Help menu for that<br>
document.

<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A CLOSER LOOK AT APPLE GUIDE 2.1</h2>
<p>
Apple Guide 2.1 introduces a new concept: the multiprocess guide file. A multiprocess<br>
guide file is specified by including in the guide file an 'mlti' resource for conventional<br>
applications or a 'prts' resource for OpenDoc part editors. Because these two are so<br>
similar, I'll discuss them together. I'll also tell you more about the new 'apsg'<br>
resource, which when added to a guide file means that the guide file's name will appear<br>
in the Help menus of multiple applications.
</p>
<p>
<b>USING MULTIPROCESS GUIDE FILES</b>
</p>
<p>
Before multiprocess guide files, the name of every guide file that met Apple Guide's<br>
criteria for inclusion in the Help menu appeared as its own menu item. Multiprocess<br>
guide files are different. All multiprocess guide files that are candidate guide files and<br>
that aren't excluded for any reason (other than that there's more than one of them) get<br>
grouped together with the Help guide file (if there is one). This group is accessed<br>
through a single Help menu item labeled "Process Name Guide," where Process Name is<br>
the document name for OpenDoc and the application name for conventional applications.<br>
This item is placed in the menu position that the name of the Help guide file would<br>
otherwise occupy. Figure 2 shows a Help menu with a multiprocess guide item for a<br>
Cyberdog document called Peter's Notebook.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2.</b> A Help menu with a multiprocess guide item
</p>
<p>
When users choose the multiprocess guide menu item from the Help menu in a<br>
conventional application, they get a combined Full Access window, known as a Merged<br>
Access window, with these features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Topic areas for each multiprocess guide and for the Help guide, listed<br>
under the guide file's name in the order specified in the guide's topic area list<br>
(see Figure 3).</li>
<li>Index terms for each multiprocess guide, combined, alphabetized, and<br>
with duplicates merged. When an index term is selected in the left pane, all<br>
topics associated with the term are listed on the right for all guides (Figure<br>
4).</li>
<li>"Look For" search capability, which can search all multiprocess guide<br>
files independently and return a list combining all the topics that match in<br>
each guide file (Figure 5).</li>
</ul>

<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If a guide file has an 'mlti' or a 'prts' resource, Apple Guide 2.1 ignores the guide file<br>
type specified by the &lt;Help Menu&gt; command. However, for backward compatibility,<br>
you probably should declare your multiprocess guides as type Other using the &lt;Help<br>
Menu&gt; command so that Apple Guide versions before 2.1 will list them individually in<br>
the Help menu.As I mentioned before, if there are both multiprocess guide files and a<br>
Help guide file, the Help guide gets treated as if it were another multiprocess guide and<br>
gets merged with them. If there's only a Help guide file and no multiprocess guide files<br>
for an application, the name of the Help guide file appears in its appointed slot in the<br>
Help menu, just as in previous versions of Apple Guide. Note that if there are any<br>
multiprocess guides, the Help guide, if supplied, must be a Full Access window guide to<br>
be listed in the Merged Access window with the multiprocess guide files.
</p>
<p>
Multiprocess guide files aren't mixins, as explained in "Mixin vs. Multiprocess Guide<br>
Files." For one thing, multiprocess guide files are treated independently by Apple<br>
Guide and thus won't have resource conflicts with other multiprocess guide files<br>
(unlike mixins). Furthermore, all multiprocess guides must have topic areas and<br>
index terms (that is, they must be Full Access window guides); if they don't, as you<br>
might expect, they won't be accessible in the Merged Access window.
</p>
<p>
______________________________
</p>
<p>
<b>MIXIN VS. MULTIPROCESS GUIDE FILES</b>
</p>
<p>
You might be asking, "What about mixins? Aren't they kinda like multiprocess guide<br>
files? When would I use mixins instead?"
</p>
<p>
Mixin guide files are used to add, delete, or replace content in existing guide files.<br>
Multiprocess guide files can't do this. Mixins work best for small, incremental<br>
changes, but they require good resource management. They also require a main guide<br>
file to modify.
</p>
<p>
Multiprocess guide files in OpenDoc never know which other guide files, if any, will be<br>
there when OpenDoc is loaded, so you can't use a mixin in place of a multiprocess guide<br>
file -- there may not be a main guide file to modify. Also, you don't know which other<br>
mixins might be there, so resource conflicts could easily occur.
</p>
<p>
But you can use a mixin to modify your own multiprocess guide if you do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the &lt;Mixin&gt; command as the first line in your mixin source and be<br>
sure to reference your multiprocess guide file's .sym file to avoid resource<br>
conflicts.</li>
<li>Add all the same exclusions as in your multiprocess guide file. Add<br>
additional exclusions if your mixin should activate only in special situations.</li>
<li>Add an 'mlti' or a 'prts' resource to your mixin if your main guide file has<br>
one.</li>
<li>Make sure your Mixin and your multiprocess guide files both use the<br>
&lt;Mixin Match&gt; command so that your Mixin guide file mixes only into your<br>
multiprocess guide file.</li>
</ul>
<p>
______________________________
</p>
<p>
The 'prts' resource introduced in Apple Guide 2.1 is expressly for OpenDoc. If the<br>
current process is an OpenDoc process (any process that supports OpenDoc part<br>
embedding), guide files with a 'prts' resource (like those with an 'mlti' resource) are<br>
grouped together in a Merged Access window when the user chooses the Document Name<br>
Guide item from the Help menu.
</p>
<p>
But before Apple Guide adds multiprocess guide files for an OpenDoc process, it<br>
performs one more exclusion check -- and unlike all the other exclusion criteria, this<br>
one is applied each time Apple Guide is launched and not when the Help menu is built.<br>
Apple Guide compares the list of part editor names in the 'prts' resource with the list<br>
of part editors currently in the active process and adds the guide file only if it finds a<br>
match. Thus, even though the Global Guide Files folder will likely contain multiprocess<br>
guide files for every OpenDoc part editor on the user's machine, the user will see help<br>
only for editors currently in the active process -- sort of a "dynamic" Merged Access<br>
window. If the 'prts' resource is empty -- that is, if it lists no part editor names --<br>
the guide will always be added to the Merged Access window if the current process is an<br>
OpenDoc process.
</p>
<p>
<b>USING ONE GUIDE FOR SEVERAL APPLICATIONS</b>
</p>
<p>
Recall that if you specify a creator code in a guide with the &lt;App Creator&gt; command,<br>
the guide file will be removed from the candidate list unless the application's creator<br>
code matches. But what if you have a guide for a suite of applications and you want it to<br>
appear in the Help menu for each of those applications?
</p>
<p>
Until now, the only way to do this was to have all the applications in the same folder as<br>
the guide file or to have a copy of the guide file (or an alias to it) in each application's<br>
folder. With Apple Guide 2.1, you can get the desired result much more cleanly and<br>
easily by adding to your guide file an 'apsg' resource listing the application signatures<br>
that your guide supports. Then, with your guide file in the Global Guide Files folder,<br>
the Help menu will be appropriately populated for every listed application.
</p>
<p>
If you specify an 'apsg' resource and use an &lt;App Creator&gt; command, Apple Guide 2.1<br>
uses only the resource. If there's no resource, the &lt;App Creator&gt; specification is used,<br>
if it exists. If you specify neither and you put your guide file in the Global Guide Files<br>
folder, it will appear in the Help menu for every application (which might not be what<br>
you want and could greatly annoy your users).
</p>
<p>
That brings us to the present in the evolution of Apple Guide. Now we'll look at the<br>
details of getting your guide file to work with OpenDoc. You'll see how to make help for<br>
an OpenDoc part editor accessible to users, and how to add coachmarks, context checks,<br>
and events once your guide is up and running.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>GETTING A PART EDITOR'S GUIDE INTO THE HELP MENU</h2>
<p>
Now that you know the history of Apple Guide and the Help menu, you've probably got a<br>
pretty good idea of how to get your part editor's guide to appear where you want it.<br>
Let's outline the preferred method to accomplish this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a 'prts' resource to your guide file. Use the 'prts' resource to specify<br>
all the OpenDoc part editors your guide should go with -- that is, the editors<br>
that when active should have your guide appear in the Merged Access window.<br>
Normally, you'll specify only a single part editor, but if you're writing a<br>
guide for a collection of related editors, you may list more. If you want your<br>
guide to show up no matter which part editors are in the current process, use<br>
an empty 'prts' resource (actually two bytes of zeros).</li>
<li>Make your guide an Other guide file and specify a creator code of 'odtm',<br>
the signature of the OpenDoc shell. This ensures that your guide won't appear<br>
in conventional applications if it ever ends up on a machine with an older<br>
version of Apple Guide.</li>
<li>Install your guide file in the Global Guide Files folder so that it's available<br>
to all OpenDoc processes, regardless of how OpenDoc was launched. As<br>
mentioned earlier, since OpenDoc is document-centered rather than<br>
application-centered, guide files become candidates if they're in the Global<br>
Guide Files folder or the same folder as the document the user double-clicks to<br>
launch OpenDoc, so guide files in the OpenDoc shell application's folder won't<br>
normally be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Unless for some reason you want your guide to appear as a multiprocess guide in<br>
conventional applications, you don't need and shouldn't add an 'mlti' resource.
</p>
<p>
Guide Maker doesn't support the new resources yet, so they must be created by hand<br>
where required. For the 'prts' resource needed by OpenDoc, I recommend creating a<br>
file named MyGuideOpenDocResource that you can then reference from your Guide<br>
Script source file with the line
</p>
<pre>&lt;Resource&gt; "MyGuideOpenDocResource", ALL</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
A file on this issue's CD includes samples of these resources and ResEdit templates. For<br>
the details, in Rez format, see "New Apple Guide Resources."

<p>
<b>NEW APPLE GUIDE RESOURCES</b>
</p>
<p>
Apple Guide 2.1 introduces the 'mlti', 'prts', and 'apsg' resources to support its new<br>
features. These resources must be created by hand. The 'mlti' resource, by its mere<br>
existence, means the file is a multiprocess guide file. This resource is four bytes of<br>
zeros.
</p>
<pre>type 'mlti' {
   longint = 0;
};</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The 'prts' resource is just like an 'STR#' resource -- a short specifying the number<br>
of part editor names, followed by the names.
</p>
<pre>type 'prts' as 'STR#';</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The 'apsg' resource is a long specifying the number of application signatures, followed<br>
by those signatures.
</p>
<pre>type 'apsg' {
   longint = $$Countof(SigArray);
   array SigArray {
      literal longint;
   };
};</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Here are some examples of using these Rez templates:
</p>
<pre>// Multiprocess guide file -- conventional app
resource 'mlti' (1000) {};
// Multiprocess guide for OpenDoc to be merged
// when 'Test Clock' is in the active process
resource 'prts' (1000) {{
   "Test Clock"
}};
// Guide only these two applications
resource 'apsg' (1000) {{
   'ttxt', 'MSWD'
}};</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You can provide access to your guide in ways other than Apple Guide's automatic<br>
population of the Help menu if you don't mind a little code modification -- all of the<br>
Apple Guide API calls still work just fine in OpenDoc, so you can add a Guide button or a<br>
Help menu item to your part editor and then call AGOpen when the user clicks or<br>
chooses that item. (See "Giving Users Help With Apple Guide" in develop Issue 18 for a<br>
detailed description of the Apple Guide API.)
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't modify the Help menu from within your part editor with the Toolbox<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calls HMGetHelpMenuHandle and AppendMenu (although it's perfectly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acceptable to do this from within an application -- even an application that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supports OpenDoc embedding). The system, OpenDoc, and Apple Guide don't<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;support this kind of use and many problems will occur.*
</p>
<p>
If all you need is a simple "book" guide for your part editor, with no coachmarks,<br>
context checks, or Apple events, you don't need to do anything else -- carrying out the<br>
three steps listed above is enough to make Apple Guide help for your part editor<br>
accessible within OpenDoc. If you want to provide more elaborate help, read on.

<h2>GIVING MORE ELABORATE HELP IN OPENDOC</h2>
<p>
Once your guide is up and running and the user has selected a topic, Apple Guide 2.1<br>
looks and acts just like previous versions of Apple Guide. The guide window appears on<br>
top of the application, and users can click through the guide's panels as they work in<br>
the application. But when the guide tries to communicate with the outside world, some<br>
things become more complicated. Specifically, you may have to take additional steps<br>
when you try to do any of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a coachmark on a part.</li>
<li>Get context information (perform context checks) on a part editor.</li>
<li>Send Apple events to a part editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The good news is that sending events to other applications such as Apple Guide or the<br>
Finder, or getting system context information (such as how many monitors the<br>
computer has) or anything else not specified above, works just the same, so I won't<br>
talk about those things. Before reviewing the specific changes required to use<br>
coachmarks, perform context checks on part editors, and send your part editor Apple<br>
events, I need to discuss the biggest difference in approach required to use Apple Guide<br>
with OpenDoc: I call it the "target application" problem.
</p>
<p>
Apple Guide was written to be very System 7 friendly, so almost everything Apple<br>
Guide does relies on Apple events. Most of the Apple Guide API calls (such as<br>
AGInstallContextHandler) secretly use Apple events to get their work done.<br>
Unfortunately, when Apple events were designed, OpenDoc wasn't around. Apple events<br>
rely on targeting specific processes (usually identified by application signature).<br>
Apple Guide assumes that every application has a unique static signature and that only<br>
one instance of the application will be running at a time. (If you launch a second<br>
document for an application, the second document is opened in the same process as the<br>
first one.) Neither of these assumptions holds for OpenDoc.
</p>
<p>
The process signature for an OpenDoc process is the application signature for the root<br>
application. For documents launched with the OpenDoc shell, that signature is 'odtm'.<br>
For documents opened into other applications that support embedded parts (as<br>
ClarisWorks will soon), the signature is that of the host application. So if, for<br>
example, you target a coachmark at the 'odtm' process and your current OpenDoc<br>
session is running in ClarisWorks, the coachmark won't fire.
</p>
<p>
And there can be more than one process with the same signature running. If you<br>
already have an OpenDoc document open and go to the Finder to launch a second<br>
document, it launches as a separate process. So if both documents are launched using<br>
the OpenDoc shell, there will be two processes with the 'odtm' signature running<br>
concurrently. Then, for example, if you target a context check at the 'odtm' process,<br>
you have no idea which of the two processes will handle the request.
</p>
<p>
Even if you somehow could manage to target the correct OpenDoc process, a single<br>
OpenDoc process can have a number of part editors running inside it -- possibly<br>
multiple instances of the same part editor. How do you target a specific editor inside a<br>
particular process?
</p>
<p>
Don't abandon hope -- all is not lost! But do keep this issue in mind as I describe the<br>
steps you need to take to use some of the cooler Apple Guide features.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>PROVIDING COACHMARKS</h2>
<p>
There are two things you need to do to use coachmarks in OpenDoc: always use the Guide<br>
Script constant FRONT (I'll give examples in a moment), and then use context checks<br>
to ensure that your panel is displayed only when the user is in the right process (that<br>
is, you need to ensure that the process you want to coachmark is the front process).<br>
For the most part, you'll find that coachmarks, except object coaches (because of the<br>
target limitation), work just fine in OpenDoc.
</p>
<p>
<b>MENU COACHES</b>
</p>
<p>
Menu coaches are used to highlight a particular menu and menu item. You can refer to a<br>
menu name and item by number or name.
</p>
<p>
Menu coaches work fine in OpenDoc. The only recommendation I have (whether or not<br>
you're in OpenDoc) is always to specify menu titles and items by name and not by<br>
number. This is especially important in OpenDoc, because individual OpenDoc part<br>
editors can add menus and menu items at will (check out Cyberdog for a great example<br>
of this). For example, to coach the Drafts item in the Document menu, use something<br>
like this:
</p>
<pre>&lt;Define Menu Coach&gt; "DocumentDrafts", FRONT, REDUNDERLINE,
   "Document", "Drafts...", RED, UNDERLINE</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>WINDOW COACHES</b>
</p>
<p>
Window coaches mark static items in windows. They work in OpenDoc as in<br>
applications. For example, you could coach the user to close the window called Log with<br>
the following:
</p>
<pre>&lt;Define Window Coach&gt; "CloseBox", FRONT, REDCIRCLE,
     "Log", CLOSEBOX</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
But to have a window coach highlight a particular element of a part in a window is<br>
usually impractical in OpenDoc, because the location of a part in a window isn't<br>
predetermined. A part could be all by itself in its own window or anywhere inside a<br>
container window. An exception to this is when a part is viewed only in a situation<br>
where the offset from the window edges is known. A good example of this is the<br>
Cyberdog Web browser part, shown in Figure 6. The URL (Uniform Resource Locator)<br>
field is always in the same place because the Web browser is always in its own<br>
window, so in this case you could coach the URL field with the following window coach:
</p>
<pre>&lt;Define Window Coach&gt; "WebURLField", FRONT, REDARROW(1,4),
   FRONT, Rect(0,0,125,100)</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<img src="img/255.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 6.</b> The Cyberdog Web browser window
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>ITEM COACHES</b>
</p>
<p>
Item coaches are used in Apple Guide to coachmark items specified by dialog ID or<br>
balloon ID.
</p>
<p>
Dialog IDs work if your OpenDoc part editor brings up a standard dialog with standard<br>
dialog items. Or you can use dialog IDs to coachmark items in the OpenDoc shell dialogs.<br>
For example, to coach the Save Draft button in the Drafts dialog, you could use the<br>
following item coach:
</p>
<pre>&lt;Define Item Coach&gt; "SaveDraftButton", FRONT, REDCIRCLE,
     DialogID(1)</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You'll find that because standard Balloon Help doesn't work in OpenDoc except under<br>
special circumstances, balloon IDs are probably too tricky to use. The reason for this<br>
problem is conflicting assumptions in OpenDoc and Apple Guide about the accessibility<br>
of resources. Apple Guide expects all the balloon resource information to be available<br>
in the current resource chain. Logically, one would store balloon resources for a part<br>
editor in its resource fork, but, due to the intricacies of OpenDoc, a part editor's<br>
resource fork isn't available when Apple Guide needs it. Since Apple Guide can't get at<br>
the Balloon Help resources, it can't look up a balloon ID's rectangle, and thus you can't<br>
easily u4e balloon IDs to coachmark items in OpenDoc.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>OBJECT COACHES</h2>
<p>
Object coaches rely on guide code inside a process to return the coaching rectangle. The<br>
name of the desired object to be coached is passed to the specified target application,<br>
which responds with the coaching rectangle.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Apple Guide allows only one object coach handler per process. If two<br>
part editors in one OpenDoc process both try to install object coach handlers, the<br>
second one will override the first one (that is, any object coaches will be handled by<br>
the second editor and never by the first). This means you can't use object coaches<br>
reliably with OpenDoc processes.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you decide to use object coaches in your part editor because you know that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yours will be the only one installing an object coach handler, be sure to use<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the OpenDoc API to do the installation.
</p>
<p>
This obstacle to using object coaches in OpenDoc has been noted as a serious concern by<br>
many people, including Apple Guide authors and those on the Apple Guide and OpenDoc<br>
teams. Some possible solutions have been proposed. We can hope that updated versions<br>
of Apple Guide and OpenDoc will support one of them in the near future (although<br>
nothing has been promised yet).
</p>
<p>
<b>APPLESCRIPT COACHES</b>
</p>
<p>
AppleScript coaches don't require a target application at all, so they don't suffer<br>
directly from the target application problem. To determine the target rectangle,<br>
though, the script itself usually has to communicate with one or more OpenDoc part<br>
editors. You can make part editors scriptable, but remember to use OpenDoc's<br>
scripting API, not the regular AppleScript calls.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>PERFORMING CONTEXT CHECKS</h2>
<p>
There are three sources of context checks for guides written for OpenDoc:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the standard suite of context checks (part of the Standard Includes package<br>
on most Apple Guide CDs)</li>
<li>a new suite of standard OpenDoc context checks (designed expressly for<br>
OpenDoc)</li>
<li>any custom context checks you write for your OpenDoc part editor only</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>THE STANDARD SUITE OF CONTEXT CHECKS</b>
</p>
<p>
The standard suite of context checks includes ways of testing basic elements of the<br>
traditional Macintosh interface. Here are some examples of these context checks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a window with a given name the frontmost window?</li>
<li>Does this Macintosh have more than one monitor?</li>
<li>Is the Open item in the File menu enabled?</li>
</ul>
<p>
The context check definitions and the resources you must include in your guide to use<br>
them are on any Apple Guide authoring CD (such as the CD that comes with Apple Guide<br>
Complete, the Custom Solutions CD, or the Mac OS SDK CD).
</p>
<p>
These context checks work pretty well in OpenDoc processes. All of the system<br>
information context checks work (bit depth, printer info, file sharing info, and so<br>
on), because they all target the Finder for their information. The application<br>
information context checks work (again, you'll have to target these with FRONT),<br>
except for menu item checks, since OpenDoc controls how the menus are stored and<br>
displayed. At present, if you're using the standard context checks in an OpenDoc<br>
process, you can't determine whether a menu item is enabled, is checked, or exists at<br>
all (though you can write a custom context check to do this).
</p>
<p>
The process context checks do work, but they aren't very helpful because they're based<br>
on target application signatures. For example, asking if the current active process is<br>
'odtm' will tell you if the active process is the regular OpenDoc shell but won't help<br>
you determine whether it's some other OpenDoc process (because the user could have<br>
some other OpenDoc shell application). Nor will this confirm that the active process is<br>
the desired process (since there could be several OpenDoc processes running).
</p>
<p>
<b>THE STANDARD OPENDOC CONTEXT CHECKS</b>
</p>
<p>
To provide guide authors with tools to answer questions about OpenDoc processes, a<br>
suite of OpenDoc context checks has been written. For these context checks to work, the<br>
user must have an OpenDoc shell plug-in called AppleGuidePlugIn correctly installed.<br>
This plug-in is installed automatically when Apple Guide 2.1 is installed. If the<br>
plug-in isn't installed, all OpenDoc standard context checks will always return FALSE.
</p>
<p>
Before we look at the available OpenDoc standard context checks, you should note that<br>
for every one of these context checks that takes the name of a part editor as one of its<br>
parameters, there are two variations: if the second SHORT parameter is 0, the editor<br>
names must match exactly; if the second SHORT parameter is 1, the actual editor name<br>
need only contain the text specified in the context check. Both variations exist for all<br>
context checks that take a part editor name. All of these functions return a Boolean<br>
result (TRUE or FALSE).
</p>
<p>
<b>Is the Apple Guide plug-in available?</b>
</p>
<pre>&lt;Define Context Check&gt; "IsPlugInAvailable", 'odag', FRONT, SHORT:1</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This context check is a way to make sure that the plug-in has been installed correctly<br>
and is available to run when the next OpenDoc process runs, thus ensuring that any<br>
standard OpenDoc context check will return a correct result. The only catch is that the<br>
plug-in isn't actually installed until the first OpenDoc process has been launched, so<br>
this check will return FALSE if no OpenDoc process has yet been run, even if the<br>
plug-in is available. With this limitation in mind, you can define this context check,<br>
which ties an Apple Guide context check name to one of the resources you included<br>
above. Then you might use it this way:
</p>
<pre>&lt;Define Sequence&gt; "How do I do something?"
&lt;If&gt; IsPlugInAvailable()
   # instruction panels
&lt;Else&gt;
   # panel saying that this guide requires Apple Guide 2.1
&lt;End If&gt;
&lt;End Sequence&gt;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You probably won't need to use this context check and will just assume that the Apple<br>
Guide plug-in was installed correctly.
</p>
<p>
<b>Is OpenDoc active and frontmost?</b>
</p>
<pre>&lt;DCC&gt; "IsOpenDocActiveAndFrontmost", 'odag', FRONT, SHORT:2</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Use this context check to see whether the active process is an OpenDoc process. It isn't<br>
application signature based and thus will return TRUE for any OpenDoc process, no<br>
matter what the host application is.
</p>
<p>
<b>Is the part editor named "MyPart 1.0" installed?</b>
</p>
<pre>&lt;DCC&gt; "PartEditorInstalled", 'odag', FRONT, SHORT:4,
     SHORT:O, LPSTRING
&lt;DCC&gt; "PartEditorInstContains", 'odag', FRONT, SHORT:4,
     SHORT:1, LPSTRING</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To determine whether a particular part editor is installed in the OpenDoc Editors<br>
folder and is available, use this context check. It has nothing to do with whether an<br>
instance of the part editor is currently in the active process. You might use a call like<br>
PartEditorInstalled("MyPart 1.0") to make sure that a particular part editor has been<br>
installed on the machine before you tell users to do something that depends on the part<br>
editor's being available. This is one of the functions that takes a part editor name as its<br>
argument; you could use the less specific version of the function by calling<br>
PartEditorInstContains("MyPart"), but take care -- you might end up matching<br>
someone else's part editor if you're too general!
</p>
<p>
<b>Is the part editor named "MyPart 1.0" in the active process?</b>
</p>
<pre>&lt;DCC&gt; "PartInActiveProcess", 'odag', FRONT, SHORT:6,
     SHORT:O, LPSTRING</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This is a way to check whether an instance of the specified part editor is in the active<br>
(frontmost) process. The corresponding part may or may not be in the active<br>
(frontmost) window.
</p>
<p>
<b>Is a "MyPart 1.0" part in the active window or in a nonactive window?</b>
</p>
<pre>&lt;DCC&gt; "PartInActiveWindow", 'odag', FRONT, SHORT:7,
    SHORT:O, LPSTRING
&lt;DCC&gt; "PartInNonActiveWindow", 'odag', FRONT, SHORT:8,
    SHORT:O, LPSTRING</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
These two context checks enable you to see whether there's an instance of the part<br>
either in or not in the active (frontmost) window.
</p>
<p>
<b>Is a "MyPart 1.0" part in the active document or in a nonactive</b><br>
<b>document?</b>
</p>
<pre>&lt;DCC&gt; "PartInActiveDoc", 'odag', FRONT, SHORT:14,
    SHORT:O, LPSTRING
&lt;DCC&gt; "PartInNonActiveDoc", 'odag', FRONT, SHORT:15,
    SHORT:O, LPSTRING</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
An OpenDoc process can contain multiple documents. A particular document in a<br>
process might have more than one window. These two context checks enable you to see<br>
if an instance of the specified part is in any of the active document's windows or any<br>
windows of a nonactive document. It's unlikely you'll need these checks -- most of the<br>
time you'll want to check whether a part is in the active window or the active process.
</p>
<p>
<b>Is a "MyPart 1.0" part the active part (the active frame)?</b>
</p>
<pre>&lt;DCC&gt; "PartIsActiveFrame", 'odag', FRONT, SHORT:10, SHORT:O, LPSTRING</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This is a way to check whether an instance of the specified part is the currently active<br>
part. This is useful to know because a part editor's menus are usually available only<br>
when the part is active.
</p>
<p>
<b>Is the active part the root part?</b>
</p>
<pre>&lt;DCC&gt; "ActivePartIsRoot", 'odag', FRONT, SHORT:9</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you need to determine whether the active part is the root part for the active<br>
document, use this check.
</p>
<p>
<b>Does the active part allow embedding?</b>
</p>
<pre>&lt;DCC&gt; "ActivePartAllowsEmbedding", 'odag', FRONT, SHORT:5</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
With this check you can determine whether the active part is a container part and<br>
allows other parts to be embedded inside it. You might use this if, as part of a task, you<br>
need to get the user to drag a new instance of a part into the active container part.
</p>
<p>
<b>Is the active document bundled?</b>
</p>
<pre>&lt;DCC&gt; "ActiveDocumentIsBundled", 'odag', FRONT, SHORT:3</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This is a way to check whether the active document is bundled. Bundling a document<br>
prevents any subparts in the document from being activated; clicking on a subpart in a<br>
bundled document will select the subpart but won't activate it. In essence, this makes<br>
all subparts in the document read-only.
</p>
<p>
<b>Is the active document dirty?</b>
</p>
<pre>&lt;DCC&gt; "ActiveDocumentIsDirty", 'odag', FRONT, SHORT:11</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This is a way to check whether the active document is dirty (needs to be saved). If this<br>
context check returns TRUE, the Save menu item is enabled. You might use this to tell<br>
the user to save changes if necessary.
</p>
<p>
<b>CUSTOM CONTEXT CHECKS</b>
</p>
<p>
If you still need more specific part information that isn't available through the<br>
standard suite of context checks or the OpenDoc standard context checks, just as with<br>
standard applications you'll need to write custom context checks.
</p>
<p>
To define and use a custom context check, you must work around two difficulties. The<br>
first is the target application issue we're now so familiar with. As before, it's easy to<br>
work around: when writing the &lt;Define Context Check&gt; command for your custom<br>
context check, you'll need to use the FRONT constant for the target application. The<br>
second problem concerns the fact that you could have multiple instances of a part<br>
editor running at the same time, in either the same or a different OpenDoc process.<br>
This is a problem for both the guide author and the custom context check writer.
</p>
<p>
The primary concern is for the guide author: if there are multiple instances of the<br>
same part editor in one or more currently running OpenDoc processes, it's impossible<br>
for your guide to identify which part editor you're providing help for. Let's look at an<br>
example. Before step 1 of your task, you use the standard OpenDoc context checks to<br>
make sure an instance of your part is active. You then tell the user to do step 1. Step 2<br>
requires step 1 to have been completed, so you want to do a custom context check to see<br>
if step 1 has been done. However, if there are two instances of your part around, which<br>
instance the custom context check queries is unknown. Users may have successfully<br>
completed step 1, but the context check may come back saying they haven't. In this<br>
case, they'll be stuck at this point and won't be able to continue.
</p>
<p>
The context check writer has similar concerns. The way a part editor would install and<br>
remove a context check handler would probably be to call AGInstallContextHandler in<br>
its constructor and AGRemoveContextHandler in its destructor. If it's done this way,<br>
anytime a new instance of the part is created it overrides (and removes) the previous<br>
context handler, so the last instance of the part to be created is the one that will supply<br>
context information, no matter which process it's in. In addition, when a part editor<br>
calls AGRemoveContextHandler, it will remove whichever handler is currently<br>
installed; if one of two instances of the part is destroyed, the context handler will be<br>
removed, leaving no context handler for the remaining instance.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, there's no simple answer to these concerns at this time. There are<br>
partial solutions for particular cases, though. For example, if you know that your part<br>
editor will definitely have exactly one instance, you might just take your chances. If<br>
you always want to have the context check respond about the currently active instance<br>
of the part (if the active frame is the desired part), you can write an 'extm' context<br>
check that you install in your guide that asks OpenDoc for the currently active frame,<br>
and if the part behind that frame is your part, do some context checking on it. As more<br>
people try to tackle custom context checking, better solutions will evolve, perhaps<br>
using the ODExtension mechanism of OpenDoc.

<h2>APPLE EVENTS AND APPLESCRIPT</h2>
<p>
Sometimes you also want to send Apple events or launch AppleScript scripts from your<br>
guide when a user clicks a particular button or goes to a particular panel. As I've said<br>
before, this is still possible in OpenDoc part editor guides. The only thing that's more<br>
challenging is when you want to send an event to your part editor. OpenDoc supports<br>
Apple event handling for part editors by overriding a number of the standard Apple<br>
event Toolbox routines and by providing a way to target a particular part editor.<br>
Explaining how to do this is beyond the scope of this article; for more information,<br>
read the OpenDoc Programmer's Guide, especially Chapter 9, "Semantic Events and<br>
Scripting."
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>REACH OUT AND GUIDE SOMEONE</h2>
<p>
As you can see, Apple Guide 2.1 provides a number of new features, both for standard<br>
guides and guides written for OpenDoc part editors. And despite a few limitations,<br>
writing guides for part editors is as easy as writing them for standalone applications.<br>
So try it out! Users and reviewers seem to agree: Apple Guide -- and thus any<br>
application or part editor that has guides -- is in a class by itself.
