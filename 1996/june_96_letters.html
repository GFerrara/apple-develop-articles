<b>TOOLFRONTEND FIXES</b><br>
Thanks to Tim Maroney for his excellent column on&nbsp;&nbsp;ToolServer and CodeWarrior<br>
(develop Issue 25). But there's a bug in ToolFrontEnd that causes CodeWarrior IDE<br>
1.5b2 to throw away the preferences every time I use it. In case you're interested, I<br>
have the solution to the problem. In addition, I've fixed a dialog for the CodeWarrior 8<br>
API and cleaned up the code for the new&nbsp;&nbsp;API.<br>
<p>
This bug aside, this excellent little utility has helped me a lot in my development.<br>
-- Andreas Magnusson
</p>
<p>
<i>Thank you for the bug report. I've created a new version of&nbsp;&nbsp;ToolFrontEnd that contains</i><br>
<i>your bug fixes and others; it can be found on this issue's CD.&nbsp;&nbsp;The plug-in API was in a</i><br>
<i>state of flux when I wrote ToolFrontEnd -- the new API documentation arrived on the</i><br>
<i>day of my deadline for the CD, so there was no opportunity to adapt my first release for</i><br>
<i>it.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I'm glad to have helped in your development; that's the real reason I write these things.</i><br>
<i>-- Tim Maroney</i>

<b>FONTTOPICT SNAFU</b><br>
Regarding this code in FontToPict in Issue 25's Print Hints column:
</p><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<pre>MakePSHandle(qdFont, qdStyle,myEncoding, &amp;picCommentHdl);
PicComment(kPostScriptHandle,GetHandleSize(picCommentHdl),
    piccommentHdl);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I recall that the second ar gument to PicComment is a word, which means you can't<br>
have a picture&nbsp;&nbsp;comment bigger than 32767 bytes. I think&nbsp;&nbsp;Type 1 fonts are usually<br>
quite close to this size. Should people be worried about this?<br>
-- Lawrence D'Oliveiro
</p>
<p>
<i>Color me stupid. You're right, people should be worried about this when they're</i><br>
<i>sending the whole font. Hopefully you'll be sending only the portion of the font that</i><br>
<i>you'll actually need, so the data requirements will be less. But if you're not, you need</i><br>
<i>to break up the font data or use another mechanism to send it to the printer. Sorry</i><br>
<i>about that.</i><br>
<i>-- Dave Polaschek</i>

<b>SCRIPTABLE DATABASE UPDATE</b><br>
When I try to use CodeWarrior 7 to compile Greg Anderson's Scriptable Database<br>
1.0a11 (from his article on whose clause resolution in develop Issue 24), I get the<br>
following link error:
</p>
<pre>: mpwexit.c: '__cleanupandexit__'
referenced from '_exit' is undefined</pre>
<p>
How can I fix this?<br>
-- Jean Jourdain
</p>
<p>
<i>You can't fix it; that version of the Scriptable Database won't compile with</i><br>
<i>CodeWarrior 7, only with CodeWarrior 6 (I'll spare you the gory details). But the</i><br>
<i>new version on this issue' s CD (1.0a15) has been updated so that it works fine with</i><br>
<i>CodeWarrior 7 and later. Sorry for any inconvenience.</i><br>
<i>-- Dave Johnson</i>
</p>
<p>



<b>GOOD TIMING</b><br>
Thanks to Martin Minow for his "Timing on the Macintosh" article on develop's CD. It<br>
saved me from&nbsp;&nbsp;having to hunt down and strangle whoever wrote "you must write an<br>
application-defined routine that calculates the elapsed time" in <i>Inside Macintosh: OS</i><br>
<i>Utilities</i> and then didn't supply one.<br>
-- Isidore Ducasse
</p>
<p>
<i>Inside Macintosh can't supply code for everything; I'm glad develop could help fill the</i><br>
<i>gap. Note that the Timing article has been updated on the CD.</i><br>

<b>OODL(E)S OF SPEED IN LISP</b><br>
Dave Johnson's excellent column on OODLs in Issue 24 is informative and straight to<br>
the point.&nbsp;&nbsp;When he's talking about the overhead associated with dynamic languages,<br>
however, he's not quite up to date. Dynamic languages need not be slower than static<br>
languages. They can be, if the programmer isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;interested in speed. But on the other<br>
hand, numerical code in a modern LISP is every bit as fast as FORTRAN or C code, if the<br>
programmer cares to add a few declarations.&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no need to add external modules<br>
for speed nowadays.
</p>
<p>
True, some dynamic languages have a lot of runtime overhead, but LISP isn't one of<br>
them.&nbsp;&nbsp;This fact needs to be emphasized to programmers, not the obsolete idea that LISP<br>
is a slow and memory-hungry dinosaur. Interpreted LISP might have been slow 15<br>
years ago, but so was BASIC. Unfortunately, many&nbsp;&nbsp;programmers still think LISP is<br>
interpreted, and the comparison between a compiled language such as modern C or<br>
Pascal with an ancient interpreted LISP implementation is simply not fair, nor is it<br>
correct. With Common LISP, lexical scoping, and modern compiler technology, LISP<br>
can be just as fast as any static language. So, your example of a QuickDraw 3D<br>
renderer in LISP is in fact an excellent idea.<br>
-- Peter Bengtson
</p>
<p>
<i>You're right, of course. Writing time-critical, number-crunching code in LISP is</i><br>
<i>eminently practical now. Among dynamic languages, LISP in particular has matured in</i><br>
<i>a big way and is now almost a hybrid&nbsp;&nbsp;language: full dynamism if you want it (with</i><br>
<i>some&nbsp;&nbsp;accompanying overhead) or, with appropriate declarations and "explicitness of</i><br>
<i>purpose" by the programmer, the speed (and brittleness!) of a static language. In a</i><br>
<i>sense, it's the best of both worlds, letting the programmer decide what best fits the</i><br>
<i>situation. So yes, my example was flawed, though I hope the spirit of it came through</i><br>
<i>despite this.</i><br>
<i>-- Dave Johnson</i>

<h2>TOOTING OWN OUR HORN: develop WINS BIG IN COMPETITION</h2>
<p>
We're happy to announce that develop has won top honors in the STC' s 1995 Northern<br>
California Technical Communications competition. STC is the Society for&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical<br>
Communication, an international organization of more than 18,000 writers, editors,<br>
and other technical communicators. In its category of Monthly or Quarterly Magazines,<br>
develop won not only the highest-level award, Distinguished&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical<br>
Communication, but also Best of Category. It then went on to win a Merit award in&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br>
STC's International Technical Publications Competition.
</p>
<p>
We're going to indulge ourselves here and list some of the judges' comments that we're<br>
particularly fond of.
</p><ul>
<li><i>The writing was very focused and stuck to the article's point.&nbsp;&nbsp;All articles</i><br>
<i>seemed very informative.</i>
<li><i>Very well organized and well laid out.</i>
<li><i>The voice is very personable without being overly familiar.</i>
<li><i>The articles use humor appropriately. The material is very readable.</i>
<li><i>develop is a very polished, engaging publication from beginning to end.</i></ul>
<p>
It's nice to get feedback like this from the competition judges, but you, our readers,<br>
are the judges who count the most. You're the ones we want to be sure are happy with<br>
develop.&nbsp;&nbsp;We'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for the valuable input you've<br>
given us over the six and a half years of develop' s existence, and to ask you&nbsp;&nbsp;to please<br>
keep it coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without your support and encouragement -- and your critical<br>
feedback -- we wouldn't be what we are today.
</p>
<p>
