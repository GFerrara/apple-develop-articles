<p>
You've probably heard the expression, "Time is nature's way of keeping everything<br>
from happening at once." Well, keeping things from happening at the same time is<br>
especially important on computers, and they're particularly good at keeping close<br>
track of time -- both "clock" time and relative time. This article shows you how to<br>
take advantage of the timing options provided on the Macintosh, including new routines<br>
that are available on the PCI-based Macintosh and will also work under Mac OS 8.
</p>
<p>
There are three common situations in which applications need to keep track of time:
</p>
<ul>
<li>measuring elapsed time -- for example, for performance analysis or to<br>
see how long it takes the user or some other external entity to perform an<br>
action</li>
<li>recording an event -- for example, to time-stamp a record in a database<br>
or to inform the user when an action occurs</li>
<li>scheduling an event -- for example, to start or complete a<br>
time-dependent task</li>
</ul>
<p>
Several timing-related routines are available on the Macintosh, and each is useful in<br>
certain situations. In general, you should:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Use GetDateTime (or GetTime) if you need to maintain information across<br>
system restarts or need to relate an event to the calendar.</li>
<li>Use TickCount if you need only a relatively crude measure of time or need<br>
to run under System 6.</li>
<li>Use the Time Manager's Microseconds routine or Time Manager tasks if<br>
you need improved precision or some attention to drift-free timing. Because<br>
the Time Manager is part of all versions of System 7, it provides the best<br>
service to most clients.</li>
<li>Use UpTime if you want the highest-precision timing available and run<br>
only on PCI-based Macintosh systems or under Mac OS 8.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This article presents the basics of some standard approaches to the three types of<br>
timing, along with code examples using many of the timing tools at your disposal.<br>
There's also a discussion of factors that can affect the precision of your timing<br>
operations. A simple example of using Microseconds is included on thisissue's CD.
</p>
<h2>MEASURING ELAPSED TIME</h2>
<p>
The Macintosh provides several functions that can be used to measure elapsed time.<br>
Your choice of routine depends on the degree of precision you require and the system<br>
software you're running under.
</p>
<p>
The GetDateTime function returns the current clock time as the number of seconds<br>
since January 1, 1904, and the GetTime function returns the clock time in year,<br>
month, day, hour, minute, and second format (in a date-time record). With their<br>
one-second resolution, however, these functions aren't well suited to measuring<br>
elapsed code performance or the duration of user actions.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>January 1, 1904, was chosen</b> as the base for the Macintosh clock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because it was the first leap year of the twentieth century. 1900 wasn't a leap<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year because leap years are skipped every 100 years for three centuries. On<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fourth century, which will be the year 2000, the leap year isn't skipped.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that by starting with 1904, Macintosh system programmers could<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save a half dozen instructions in their leap-year checking code, which they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thought was way cool.*
</p>
<p>
One of the functions available for finer timing resolution is TickCount, which returns<br>
the time elapsed since the system last started up in units of about 1/60 second. Until<br>
System 7, this was the only reasonable way to measure sub-second intervals. With<br>
System 7, the Microseconds routine became available. (Using the extended Time<br>
Manager is another possible method on System 7, but it's more complicated and so isn't<br>
commonly used for that purpose.) Furthermore, the PCI-based Macintosh (and Mac OS<br>
8) provide UpTime, a replacement for Microseconds.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE MICROSECONDS ROUTINE</b>
</p>
<p>
The Microseconds routine returns the number of microseconds that have elapsed since<br>
system startup as an unsigned 64-bit integer and offers a convenient way of timing<br>
events and operations. Theoretically, it can resolve intervals of about 20<br>
microseconds, although in practice it can't time intervals that small (for reasons<br>
given later, in the section on timing accuracy).
</p>
<p>
The value returned by Microseconds has the UnsignedWide structure, shown in Listing<br>
1. A signed wide structure is used for the result of subtracting two Microseconds<br>
values to calculate elapsed time. UnsignedWide is defined in Types.h of the universal<br>
headers, but is also shown in Listing 1 for convenience.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1.</b> Microseconds structures
</p>
<pre>struct UnsignedWide {
   unsigned long       hi;
   unsigned long       lo;
};
typedef struct UnsignedWide UnsignedWide;

struct wide {
   signed long       hi;
   unsigned long      lo;
};
typedef struct wide wide;

/*
 * The sample code defines a SignedWide structure for consistency.
 */
typedef wide SignedWide;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To time a routine, your application would do the following:
</p>
<pre>UnsignedWide    startTime;
UnsignedWide    endTime;

Microseconds(&amp;startTime);
DoMyOperation();
Microseconds(&amp;endTime);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Subtracting startTime from endTime will yield the elapsed time. However, the 64-bit<br>
Microseconds values are rather unwieldy to deal with. The simplest solution is to<br>
convert them to double-precision floating-point numbers. MicrosecondToDouble,<br>
shown in Listing 2, converts a Microseconds value to double-precision floating point.<br>
Using double precision will retain accuracy for all practical purposes. You can also<br>
use integer subtraction to get the difference between the two times and convert the<br>
result to floating point (or whatever you need) afterward. MicrosecondDelta, also in<br>
Listing 2, computes the difference between two Microseconds result values, returning<br>
a signed 64-bit integer to retain precision.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 2.</b> Microseconds routine support functions
</p>
<pre>#define kTwoPower32 (4294967296.0)      /* 2^32 */

double MicrosecondToDouble(register const UnsignedWide *epochPtr)
{
   register double    result;

   result = (((double) epochPtr-&gt;hi) * kTwoPower32) + epochPtr-&gt;lo;
   return (result);
}

void MicrosecondDelta(register const UnsignedWide   *startPtr,
                      register const UnsignedWide    *endPtr,
                      register SignedWide          *resultPtr)
{
   if (endPtr-&gt;lo &gt;= startPtr-&gt;lo)
      resultPtr-&gt;hi = endPtr-&gt;hi - startPtr-&gt;hi;
   else
      resultPtr-&gt;hi = (endPtr-&gt;hi - 1) - startPtr-&gt;hi;
     
   resultPtr-&gt;lo = endPtr-&gt;lo - startPtr-&gt;lo;
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>If you prefer using only integer arithmetic</b>, the sample code on this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issue's CD includes a very simple -- and very inefficient -- 64-bit integer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;library with add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions that can be used to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calculate time values. For a more complete 64-bit integer math library, see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the article "64-Bit Integer Math on 680x0 Machines" in develop Issue 26.*
</p>
<p>
<b>THE UPTIME ROUTINE</b>
</p>
<p>
PCI-based Macintosh systems and the Mac OS 8 operating system provide a new<br>
routine, UpTime, that returns the value of the PowerPC internal clock. The value<br>
that's returned has the data type AbsoluteTime and cannot be interpreted directly by<br>
applications, because the units are system dependent and not defined by the API. A<br>
library is provided to convert values of type AbsoluteTime into formats whose units<br>
are known. This approach allows the system to maximize precision and performance.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The time values returned by UpTime start at 0 at system startup and increase<br>
monotonically for as long as it's running. To time a routine with UpTime, your<br>
application might do the following:
</p>
<pre>AbsoluteTime    startTime;
AbsoluteTime  endTime;
AbsoluteTime  elapsedTime;
Nanoseconds   elapsedNanoseconds;
              /* This is an UnsignedWide integer */

startTime = UpTime();
DoMyOperation();
endTime = UpTime();
elapsedTime = SubAbsoluteFromAbsolute(endTime, startTime);
elapsedNanoseconds = AbsoluteToNanoseconds(elapsedTime);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
These functions and others used to process AbsoluteTime values are described<br>
in<i>Designing PCI Cards and Drivers for Power Macintosh Computers</i>.
</p>
<h2>RECORDING EVENT OCCURRENCE</h2>
<p>
If you need to record when an event occurred (for example, when a record was added to<br>
a database), you can use the value returned by GetDateTime or GetTime. In most<br>
situations, GetDateTime is easier to deal with, being more compact and saving you from<br>
converting days, months, years, and so on into seconds for computations.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep in mind that GetDateTime returns the local clock time, which means that you<br>
can't always use its value to determine which of two records is earlier, as they could<br>
have been created in different time zones or under different daylight saving time rules.<br>
If being able to compare times across time zones is important, your application should<br>
call the ReadLocation routine and store its MachineLocation result at the time you<br>
record the event so that the application can compute a location-independent value by<br>
converting the local time to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time).
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the local time value returned by GetDateTime isn't coordinated with the<br>
more precise values returned by Microseconds and UpTime. This makes it difficult to<br>
record local times with fractional second resolution. Listing 3 shows one way to work<br>
around this problem. It's adapted from the LogConvertTimestamp function in my PCI<br>
device driver sample library, which was first published in <i>develop</i> Issue 22<br>
("Creating PCI Device Drivers"). Listing 3 also illustrates my simple 64-bit support<br>
library.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 3.</b> Time of day with fractional second resolution
</p>
<pre>void LogConvertTimestamp(
    AbsoluteTime   eventTime,              /* Value to convert   */
    DateTimeRec    *eventDateTime,         /* Result goes here   */
    UInt32         *residualNanoseconds    /* Fractional second  */
   )
{
   Nanoseconds                eventNanoseconds;
   UnsignedWide               eventSeconds, temp;
   static const UnsignedWide  kTenE9 = { 0, 1000000000L };
   static UInt32              gUpTimeNumerator;
   static UnsignedWide        gUpTimeDenominator;
   static Nanoseconds         gNanosecondsAtStart = { 0, 0 };

   /*
    * If this is the first call, compute the offset between
    * GetDateTime and UpTime.
    */
   if (gNanosecondsAtStart.lo == 0 &amp;&amp; gNanosecondsAtStart.hi == 0) {
      UnsignedWide      secondsAtStart;
      AbsoluteTime      absoluteTimeAtStart;
      Nanoseconds         upTimeAtStart, nanosecondsAtStart;

      secondsAtStart.hi = 0;
      GetDateTime(&amp;secondsAtStart.lo);
      upTimeAtStart = AbsoluteToNanoseconds(UpTime());
      Multiply64(&amp;secondsAtStart, kTenE9.lo, &amp;nanosecondsAtStart);
      Subtract64(&amp;nanosecondsAtStart, &amp;upTimeAtStart,
            &amp;gNanosecondsAtStart);
   }
   /*
    * Convert the event time (UpTime value) to nanoseconds and add
    * the local time epoch.
    */
   eventNanoseconds = AbsoluteToNanoseconds(eventTime);
   Add64(&amp;gNanosecondsAtStart, &amp;eventNanoseconds, &amp;eventNanoseconds);
   /*
    * eventSeconds = eventNanoseconds /= 10e9;
    * residualNanoseconds = eventNanoseconds % 10e9;
    * Finally, compute the local time (seconds) and fraction.
    */
   Divide64(&amp;eventNanoseconds, &amp;kTenE9, &amp;eventSeconds);
   *residualNanoseconds = eventNanoseconds.lo;
   SecondsToDate(eventSeconds.lo, eventDateTime);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SCHEDULING FUTURE ACTIONS</h2>
<p>
Actions can be scheduled at a specific time -- such as 3 P.M. -- or at a relative time<br>
-- like "15 minutes from now." Here we'll look at how an application can schedule an<br>
action for a specific time by polling from its event loop and how to use the extended<br>
Time Manager to initiate an action after a specific amount of time passes.
</p>
<p>
<b>POLLING FROM THE EVENT LOOP</b>
</p>
<p>
The simplest way for an application to schedule an action for a specific time is to call<br>
GetDateTime every so often from the event loop and compare the returned value with<br>
the time set for the scheduled event. (If all your application is doing is polling for the<br>
right time to arrive, be nice and set the WaitNextEvent sleep time to something long<br>
-- 15 seconds, perhaps.) When the set time matches (or is earlier than) the returned<br>
value, the event occurs. Of course, you can use this solution only if your program is an<br>
application (normal or faceless-background). Code resources should use an extended<br>
Time Manager task with a completion routine instead (as described in the next<br>
section).
</p>
<p>
The event-loop approach works best when you want to schedule an action for a specific<br>
time because the specified time will be observed even if the user changes the system's<br>
date or time. (Note that under this approach, an event that just occurred could occur<br>
again if the user changes the time backwards.) However, if it's important that the<br>
action happen at some relative amount of time in the future, you're better off polling<br>
with TickCount, Microseconds, or UpTime or using an extended Time Manager task<br>
with a completion routine.
</p>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APPLICATION COMPATIBILITY</b>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macintosh applications need to check whether particular operating system<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;functions are available before using them. For example (as you'll see later in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listing 5), the Gestalt function can be used to check for the presence of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extended Time Manager and the Process Manager. This technique lets your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application configure itself to your customer's exact hardware and system.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to add UpTime support to an application that must also run on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macintosh systems that lack this function, you'll have to use a different<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approach, because your PowerPC application uses the Code Fragment Manager<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to link to the shared library that provides this service. If the shared library<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not present on the customer system, your application will not launch (and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the user will be quite perplexed). The simplest way to work around this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem is to use your development environment's "weak link" or "soft<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;import" capability. By weak-linking these functions, your application will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;start even if the necessary shared library isn't present. This technique is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;described in detail in <i>Inside Macintosh: PowerPC System Software</i>, page 1-25.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;______________________________
</p>
<p>
<b>USING THE EXTENDED TIME MANAGER</b>
</p>
<p>
The extended Time Manager was introduced in System 7 as a way to schedule accurate<br>
periodic actions. Precise timing and real-time synchronization was becoming more<br>
important with increasing use of sound and multimedia. In addition, the extended Time<br>
Manager is the preferred way to schedule an action for a code resource. Scheduling an<br>
action with the extended Time Manager is suitable for waits of moderate duration (up<br>
to a day or so).
</p>
<p>
The following example uses the extended Time Manager to awaken a process 30 seconds<br>
after the timer is started. As shown in Listing 4, the first step is to define an extended<br>
Time Manager task record that includes the timer task, the process serial number of<br>
the process to awaken when the timer expires, and (on 680x0 systems) a pointer to<br>
the application's globals. (Throughout this example we assume an application context,<br>
so this value is A5; for THINK and Metrowerks nonapplication code, it should be A4<br>
instead.) Listing 4 also defines the interface for the Time Manager completion routine<br>
-- notice that it varies for 680x0 and PowerPC compilations.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 4.</b> Extended Time Manager definitions
</p>
<pre>#include &lt;Types.h&gt;
#include &lt;Timer.h&gt;
#include &lt;OSUtils.h&gt;
#include &lt;GestaltEqu.h&gt;
#include &lt;Processes.h&gt;

/* Define an extended task record. */
struct ExtendedTimerRec {
   TMTask               tmTask;
   ProcessSerialNumber   taskPSN;
#if GENERATINGPOWERPC
   /* Nothing needed for PowerPC */
#else
   long                  applicationA5;
#endif
};
typedef struct ExtendedTimerRec ExtendedTimerRec, *ExtendedTimerPtr;

/* Define the interface for a completion function. */
#if GENERATINGPOWERPC
   pascal void TimerCallbackProc(TMTaskPtr tmTaskPtr);
#else      /* 680x0 */
   pascal void TimerCallbackProc(void);
   /*
    * This inline function returns the extended Time Manager task
    * pointer, which is passed to the completion routine in register
A1.
    */
   pascal TMTaskPtr GetTMTaskPtr(void) = 0x2E89;
#endif</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Before you can use your extended task record, you need to be sure the extended Time<br>
Manager and Process Manager are present on the system. Listing 5 shows code that<br>
checks for their presence. If they're present, the code initializes the extended task<br>
record (gExtendedTimerRec), installs the task in the extended Time Manager's event<br>
queue, and starts the timer.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 5.</b> Starting the timer
</p>
<pre>   long         gestaltResponse;

   if (Gestalt(gestaltTimeMgrVersion, &amp;gestaltResponse) != noErr
         || (gestaltResponse &lt; gestaltExtendedTimeMgr))
      goto failure;   /* The extended Time Manager is not present. */
   if (Gestalt(gestaltOSAttr, &amp;gestaltResponse) != noErr
         || (gestaltResponse &amp; (1L << gestaltLaunchControl)) == 0)
      goto failure;   /* The Process Manager is not present. */
   /*
    * Configure the global structure that stores the timing
    * information.
    */
   gExtendedTimerRec.tmTask.qLink = NULL;
   gExtendedTimerRec.tmTask.qType = 0;
   gExtendedTimerRec.tmTask.tmAddr = NewTimerProc(TimerCallbackProc);
   gExtendedTimerRec.tmTask.tmCount = 0;
   gExtendedTimerRec.tmTask.tmWakeup = 0;
   gExtendedTimerRec.tmTask.tmReserved = 0;
#if GENERATINGPOWERPC
   /* Nothing needed for PowerPC. */
#else
   gExtendedTimerRec.applicationA5 = SetCurrentA5();
#endif
   GetCurrentProcess(&amp;gExtendedTimerRec.taskPSN);
   InsXTime((QElemPtr) &amp;gExtendedTimerRec.tmTask);
   /*
   * Start the timer -- 30-second stall.
   */
   PrimeTime((QElemPtr) &amp;gExtendedTimerRec.tmTask, 30000L);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You also need to define the extended Time Manager completion routine that's called<br>
when the timer expires (see Listing 6).
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 6.</b> Extended Time Manager completion routine
</p>
<pre>/*
 * Define an extended Time Manager completion routine that awakens
 * the specified application.
 */
#if GENERATINGPOWERPC
   pascal void TimerCallbackProc(TMTaskPtr tmTaskPtr)
   {
#else
   pascal void TimerCallbackProc(void)
   {
      TMTaskPtr      tmTaskPtr;
      long            oldA5;

      tmTaskPtr = GetTMTaskPtr();
      oldA5 = SetA5(((ExtendedTimerPtr) tmTaskPtr)-&gt;applicationA5);
#endif
      gTimerFired = TRUE;
      WakeUpProcess(&amp;((ExtendedTimerPtr) tmTaskPtr)-&gt;taskPSN);
#if GENERATINGPOWERPC
      /* Nothing needed at completion routine exit. */
#else
      SetA5(oldA5);
#endif
   }</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The completion routine is a one-shot timer that awakens the process and exits. You can<br>
easily extend this to perform a periodic wake-up action. Again, note the use of A5 (use<br>
A4 for nonapplication code written in THINK or Metrowerks).
</p>
<h2>TIMING ACCURACY, PRECISION, AND OVERHEAD</h2>
<p>
If you're measuring performance, remember that you can't trust a single<br>
measurement, as it can be affected by a number of system-related asynchronous<br>
events that you can't always control. Instead, you should take a number of samples and<br>
use a statistical package to understand the variation that may affect the accuracy and<br>
precision of your timing measurement.
</p>
<p>
On current Macintosh systems, the Microseconds routine uses the hardware VIA timer<br>
as a basis for its calculation. This decrements at a rate of 783360 Hz and,<br>
consequently, limits resolution to about 1.28 microseconds. (Of course, the<br>
mechanism and resolution may change on future systems.) Due to implementation<br>
limitations, however, the Microseconds routine can't time intervals shorter than<br>
about 20 microseconds. If you're using Microseconds to time a very short interval<br>
(such as the execution time of a small code segment), your analysis may need to adjust<br>
the measurements to take into account the computational overhead of the Microseconds<br>
routine itself. This varies from machine to machine -- and depends, in part, on the<br>
influence of other systemwide processes. An informal measurement of one machine<br>
showed that the following sequence could take as little as zero time up to several<br>
hundred milliseconds:
</p>
<pre>Microseconds(&amp;startTime);
Microseconds(&amp;endTime);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The reason for this dispersion is that the internal timer is updated as a result of<br>
system interrupts, such as VIA timer and extended Time Manager task completion.<br>
Also, other asynchronous operations on the Macintosh, such as mouse-movement<br>
handlers, file sharing, I/O completion, virtual memory page faults, and network<br>
operations, will interrupt applications (and, on Mac OS 8, preemptive multitasking).<br>
Thus, if you're using Microseconds to time application program execution, it should be<br>
part of a more extensive statistical data analysis, since any single measurement may<br>
result in incorrect data. As a rule of thumb, to minimize the overhead of calling the<br>
routine itself, the smallest measurement interval should be on the order of one<br>
millisecond.
</p>
<p>
A similar warning needs to be given regarding the long-term accuracy of the<br>
Microseconds routine: The crystal oscillator used to generate the underlying time base<br>
varies slightly, depending primarily on the ambient temperature. Here, too, you<br>
should measure the actual behavior of your system. Given a 0.01% normal drift rate<br>
for the clock, a drift of 8 seconds per day is not uncommon (0.01% equals 1 second in<br>
10,000 or about 8 seconds per day). For long-term accuracy, you may need to rely on<br>
an external time source, such as a network time service as specified in Internet RFC<br>
1305, or a radio receiver tuned to a national standard, such as WWV or WWVL.

With all the processes competing on a Macintosh, it's possible, even likely, that<br>
several wait loops will end at the same instant, particularly on the boundaries of<br>
seconds or minutes. This can cause unpredictable delays. While the occasional long<br>
delay is not a problem for most ordinary desktop tasks, it can be devastating for<br>
systems that record or play live audio or QuickTime video. The developer of such a<br>
system must be very careful to avoid regular scheduling: all delay values (such as the<br>
sleep time passed to WaitNextEvent) should be varied by a small random value to<br>
minimize the chance of several wait loops ending at the same instant.

<h2>TIMING IS EVERYTHING</h2>
<p>
Whether you're trying to analyze the performance of your code, schedule a reminder<br>
for later, measure how long it takes users to complete a task, or remember exactly<br>
when they completed it, there's a straightforward method for doing it on the Macintosh.<br>
So go on, hook your programs up to the ever-flowing stream of time. No matter what<br>
you like to do with your time -- spend it or kill it, assess its quality or lose track of it<br>
-- your code will be able to keep pace.
