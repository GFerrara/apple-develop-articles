</p>
<p>
One of the things that makes QuickDraw GX interesting is its amazing typography --<br>
whatever else has been said about GX, its type capabilities are universally<br>
acknowledged as the best. Besides aesthetics, a distinguishing attribute of QuickDraw<br>
GX typography is not what is graphically possible, but the ease with which visual<br>
content can be created. A user can create documents that are kerned or tracked or have<br>
swashes, ligatures, and so on without QuickDraw GX, but achieving these effects<br>
requires a great deal of manual labor, with lots of Shift-Option-Command key<br>
combinations and switching to special fonts -- assuming the developer has made the<br>
effort to provide such a level of functionality. With QuickDraw GX, these effects are<br>
features designed into the font itself, so all the user needs to do is type and the text<br>
comes out beautifully. For different effects, the user just picks font features from a<br>
dialog or palette. The time saved by the user can be 90% over a non-GX interface! It<br>
simply has to be experienced to be appreciated.
</p>
<p>
All of this great typography is easy for the user to use because it's easy for the<br>
developer to implement. How many pre-GX drawing and illustration packages support<br>
the same level of typographic quality as their pre-GX publishing package<br>
counterparts? Not many, and of those that do, how much more memory do those<br>
applications require than they would without the typography code? Thanks to<br>
QuickDraw GX, we're beginning to see drawing and illustration programs that<br>
incorporate high-end <i>typographic</i> features and page layout programs that incorporate<br>
high-end <i>graphics</i> features -- all with lower overall memory requirements (when<br>
compared with traditional non-GX applications) because the code is in the system and<br>
is shared between applications.
</p>
<p>
Let me get to the real topic of this article. A favorite feature in illustration and page<br>
layout programs is to enable the user to lay a line of text along an arbitrary path, be it<br>
straight or curved. My goal here is to provide the developer with a way to do this,<br>
using QuickDraw GX, that's familiar to those who have been using GX and enticing to<br>
those who haven't tried it yet. If you've written code to handle text on a path in a<br>
non-GX application, consider the amount of code needed to do the editing on the screen<br>
and the amount of code you had to write to make it print on a PostScript printer. Then<br>
compare it to what's presented here -- I think the QuickDraw GX advantage will be<br>
clear!
</p>
<p>
I'll assume you have some knowledge of typography and a working knowledge of<br>
QuickDraw GX throughout my discussion. If you need to brush up on GX, there are the<br>
<i>Inside Macintosh: QuickDraw GX</i> books; the <i>Programmer's Overview</i> and<i>Typography</i><br>
volumes are most relevant here.
</p>
<p>
Accompanying this article on this issue's CD and <i>develop</i>'s Web site is a library of code<br>
called CurveLayout which very closely parallels the QuickDraw GX line layout<br>
mechanism but with support for <i>curved</i> layouts. The functions of this library will be<br>
described later.
</p>


<h2>SIMPLE INTERFACE TO DRAW TEXT ON A PATH</h2>
<p>
It turns out that QuickDraw GX provides an extremely simple method for drawing text<br>
along a curve, since it lets us make any shape a dash outline for any other shape -- to<br>
<i>dash a shape</i> means to draw another shape in a repeating pattern along the perimeter of<br>
the first shape (see Figure 1). The PostScript language, by comparison, allow only<br>
simple dashing.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1.</b> Dashing a shape
</p>
<p>
Since QuickDraw GX text is a shape, you can draw text along a path by using dashing, as<br>
shown in Listing 1.
</p>
<p>

<b>Listing 1.</b> Drawing text on a curve using dashing

<pre>void PutTextOnCurve(gxShape myPath)
{
   gxDashRecord   aDash;
   gxShape         textShape = GXNewText(5, "Hello", nil);

   // Call primitive shape to convert text to glyph.
   GXPrimitiveShape(textShape);   // All dashes must be primitive.
   aDash.dash = textShape;
   aDash.attributes = gxBreakDash;// Dash each letter separately.
   aDash.advance = 0;             // 0 advance means single repeat.

   GXSetShapeDash(myPath, &amp;aDash);
   GXDisposeShape(textShape);       // Dash is now sole owner of it.
   GXSetShapeFill(myPath, gxFrameFill);
                                    // Dash only for framed shapes.
}   // PutTextOnCurve</pre>

<p>
Listing 1 demonstrates just how simple it can be to put text on a path in QuickDraw GX.<br>
This method would also work with layout shapes in addition to text shapes (although<br>
there's a bug in GX 1.1.3 and earlier that may cause a crash if you do try to dash with a<br>
layout). While dashing may be a simple interface for drawing text along a curve, it<br>
isn't an efficient solution for editing because of the overhead incurred by constantly<br>
rebuilding the dash every time the text changes. Additionally, the dashing solution puts<br>
you at the mercy of the algorithms used for dashing -- they weren't specifically<br>
designed for text or layout manipulation.
</p>


<h2>BEHIND CURVELAYOUT</h2>
<p>
The CurveLayout library discussed here provides the illusion of a new shape type for<br>
QuickDraw GX which I affectionately call the "curve layout." I wanted to continue the<br>
object-oriented philosophy of GX by providing an API for drawing and editing text<br>
along a curved path. The idea is to provide an efficient mechanism for adding curve<br>
layouts to your application without forcing you to learn too much new stuff. While the<br>
article will go into great detail concerning the algorithms used, you need not<br>
understand them to incorporate curve layouts into your application using the<br>
CurveLayout library.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE GLYPH SHAPE</b>
</p>
<p>
Before we go too much further, it's worth discussing some things about our friend the<br>
glyph shape. There are three different kinds of shapes for drawing text: the text shape,<br>
the glyph shape, and the layout shape. Text shapes are the most familiar to those of us<br>
who have used QuickDraw or PostScript. When a text shape is drawn, its appearance is<br>
the same as the result of the DrawString call in QuickDraw or the show operator in<br>
PostScript: simply the text itself.
</p>
<p>
The relationship between glyph and layout shapes can be compared to programming.<br>
The layout shape is like a high-level language such as LISP -- a very high-level,<br>
powerful way of drawing text that produces beautiful results, but it makes specific<br>
manipulations difficult. The glyph shape is more like assembly language -- you can<br>
control every aspect of how the text draws, but even simple things require a good deal<br>
of programming effort. Nevertheless, it's the direct control possible with the glyph<br>
shape that enabled me to write CurveLayout.
</p>
<p>
A glyph shape allows the specification of individual positions and tangent vectors (and<br>
even typographic style) of every typographic element drawn in a shape.
</p>
<p>
Figure 2 illustrates the power of the glyph shape for our purposes. At left is a typical<br>
straight piece of text. The arrows represent the tangent vectors stored in the glyph<br>
shape and the dots at the ends of the arrow lines show the positions. (Note that both<br>
here and in Figure 3, the tangent vectors are drawn as <i>normals</i> -- rotated 90 degrees<br>
counterclockwise from their actual positions -- since otherwise they would run<br>
together and make a mess of the figures.) Beside that is the same text with different<br>
tangents and positions showing how these attributes might be manipulated to draw text<br>
along a path. The tangent vector specifies the scale and rotation of the glyph and is<br>
stored in the glyph shape as a point. The x and y values of this point are used to<br>
construct the mapping shown at the right in the figure. This mapping is applied to the<br>
glyph to reposition it as desired.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/290.gif" width="474 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2. </b>Glyph shape tangents, positions, and mapping matrix
</p>
<p>
But wait -- while glyph shapes give us the control we need to flow our glyphs along a<br>
path (by setting positions and tangents for each glyph in the shape), they're still like<br>
assembly language, and we don't want to position every glyph ourselves if we don't need<br>
to. The good news is that QuickDraw GX provides a "compiler" to convert layout shapes<br>
to glyph shapes, so we can use the high-level language (layout shape) instead. Our<br>
compiler is the routine GXPrimitiveShape, which allows us to deal mostly in the<br>
beautiful world of layouts and then convert them into glyph shapes that can have their<br>
positions and tangents modified to flow along a path. Layout shapes also provide us with<br>
the high-level abilities required for interactive editing (more on this later).
</p>
<p>
Now we've seen how we can convert a line layout shape into a glyph shape, and how the<br>
glyph shape can have its positions and tangents modified so that the glyphs draw along a<br>
path, but how do we <i>generate</i> those positions and tangents?
</p>
<p>
<b>POINTS ALONG A PATH</b>
</p>
<p>
QuickDraw GX can evaluate points along paths. GXShapeLengthToPoint accepts a<br>
distance and a polygon or path and returns the point along that polygon or path that's<br>
the specified distance along its perimeter. In addition to the point, the tangent vector at<br>
that point (slope of the path or polygon) is returned, which is <i>exactly</i> what we need!<br>
With this information, we can lay glyph shapes along a path by simply modifying the<br>
tangents and positions appropriately.
</p>
<p>
The x coordinate of each glyph's position represents the current linear offset of the<br>
glyph in the layout (as if it were along a straight line). A glyph's position can be<br>
determined with the GXGetGlyphMetrics function and can be used as the length along the<br>
path for GXShapeLengthToPoint. The returned point and tangent can then be inserted<br>
into the glyph shape. The results of this technique are <i>almost</i> what we want, but<br>
consider the example shown in Figure 3.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/291.gif" width="198 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3.</b> Glyphs positioned on a curve using x position as length along curve
</p>
<p>
In Figure 3, the arrows show the positions and tangents of glyphs that have been<br>
rotated around their positions, which are typically on the bottom left (at least for<br>
Roman fonts) rather than around their centers. Because of this, the text doesn't look<br>
quite right -- some of the wider glyphs even seem to leap off the curve! We can do<br>
better than this. We can use the horizontal centers of the glyphs (that is, the center of<br>
the glyph along its baseline) as the input rather than their positions. Unfortunately,<br>
the point we put back in the glyph shape must be for the position of the glyph, not its<br>
center, so we have a little work to do translating back and forth.
</p>
<p>
Given a glyph shape, the function GXGetGlyphMetrics gave us the position information<br>
that we needed to compute the points and tangents for our first attempt. This function<br>
can also be used to obtain the bounding box of a glyph, and from the bounding box we<br>
can determine the horizontal center points of each glyph.
</p>
<p>
In Figure 4, we see the glyphs for the word "Pig." The dots represent the glyph<br>
positions obtained from GXGetGlyphMetrics and the starbursts represent the<br>
horizontal center of each glyph along the x axis, determined by the bounding boxes,<br>
which I've bisected for clarity. (Note that the position of a glyph doesn't necessarily<br>
fall on the left edge of the glyph's bounding box.)
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/292.gif" width="228 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 4. </b>Glyph shape positions and horizontal centers
</p>
<p>
Listing 2 shows the loop for repositioning glyphs from CurveLayout. It illustrates how<br>
to compute the new glyph position given the location and tangent returned from<br>
GXShapeLengthToPoint, using the horizontal center to adjust the input length rather<br>
than merely using the glyph's x position. Before looping through the glyphs, we get<br>
some necessary information about the glyph shapes: the tangents (the glyph shape may<br>
have rotated glyphs to begin with, and we'd like to preserve them), the positions, and<br>
the bounding boxes. Then, for each glyph we do the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Compute the horizontal center of the glyph's bounding box.</li>
<li>Compute a vector that describes the glyph's position relative to the<br>
horizontal center of the bounding box (we'll use this in step 4).</li>
<li>Find out the position and tangent on the curve using the horizontal center<br>
of the glyph as the length along the curve.</li>
<li>Compute the new glyph position. Since earlier we described the glyph<br>
position as a vector relative to the horizontal bounding box center, and the<br>
point returned from GXShapeLengthToPoint is on the curve at the place where<br>
we want the horizontal bounding box center, we can compute the new glyph<br>
position as the vector we saved translated to the new position and rotated by<br>
the angle described by the tangent.</li>
<li>Compute the new tangent. This is the composition of the glyph's original<br>
tangent vector and the one from the path.</li>
</ol>

The results of applying this algorithm are seen in Figure 5, where the round end of the<br>
line denotes the horizontal center of the bounding box and the square end of the line<br>
denotes the glyph position. On the left is a glyph with a line illustrating the relative<br>
location of the glyph's position and its horizontal bounding box center before wrapping.<br>
On the right is that same glyph positioned on a curve using our algorithm. You can see<br>
how the glyph here is positioned more naturally on the curve than was the case in<br>
Figure 3.

I've hand-drawn all the pictures so far using a QuickDraw GX-savvy draw program<br>
(LightningDraw GX) to illustrate the development of CurveLayout. Figure 6 is a<br>
picture generated with CurveLayout itself (see the test application that accompanies<br>
this article). The baseline curve is shown for clarity. Notice that the "te" ligature --<br>
a particularly wide glyph -- in the word "pasteboard" is naturally tangent to the<br>
curve. Also, since this is QuickDraw GX, we can apply a number of transforms to the<br>
wrapped layout, such as the one shown in Figure 7.

<h2>DRAWING ISN'T ENOUGH -- WE WANT TO EDIT</h2>
<p>
QuickDraw GX's ability to draw high-quality typographic content is only half of what's<br>
interesting about its line layout capabilities -- GX also provides a number of routines<br>
to facilitate writing code to do <i>editing</i> of these beautiful lines of text, as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>GXHitTestLayout for hit testing, to find out which character a given<br>
location is nearest. It's typically used for converting mouse clicks during<br>
editing. A point is converted to a character index.</li>
<li>GXGetLayoutCaret for computing the caret shape for a position between<br>
two characters. This is used for drawing the insertion point caret. A character<br>
index is converted into the caret shape.</li>
<li>GXGetLayoutHighlight to compute the highlight shape for a run of<br>
characters, used for selecting text. A starting index and ending index are<br>
converted into a shape describing the highlight for the characters in the run.</li>
</ul>
<p>
CurveLayout wouldn't be complete if we couldn't provide these abilities. It's important<br>
for the user to be able to edit a layout on a curve in true WYSIWYG fashion. These three<br>
functions implement much of what's needed for a basic line editor. Editing whole blocks<br>
of text is left as an exercise for the programmer and is not a subject for this article!
</p>
<p>
<b>HIT TESTING</b>
</p>
<p>
The first part of editing involves being able to convert a mouse click into a character<br>
index. Since the function GXHitTestLayout does this for a normal line layout, we'd like<br>
to use as much of it as possible. The input to that function is a point relative to the<br>
layout. The important value of the point is the horizontal component. Provided that the<br>
position is within the layout, the horizontal component determines which character is<br>
nearest that value.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So, given a point on the curve, we want to undo the curvature to determine a value to<br>
pass to GXHitTestLayout. If GXShapeLengthToPoint converts a distance into a location,<br>
we need an inverse function that converts a location back to a distance. Unfortunately,<br>
QuickDraw GX has no such function. Additionally, the location of the mouse click may<br>
not be exactly <i>on</i> the shape.
</p>
<p>
Given a point, we can find the closest point on a curve. Knowing a point on a curve, we<br>
can determine the distance that point falls along the curve by doing a binary search of<br>
GXShapeLengthToPoint:
</p>
<ol>
<li>    Find the length of the shape (GXGetShapeLength).</li>
<li> Do a binary search for the point on the curve closest to the hit point by<br>
calling GXShapeLengthToPoint, passing in lengths between 0 and the total<br>
length of the curve, and systematically reducing the distance to the point you<br>
seek until it's as close as you choose.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The length determined by this method can then be passed into GXHitTestLayout.
</p>
<p>
It's important to note that the algorithm above is simplified for the sake of brevity: it<br>
works on a single quadratic curve or line segment. The code included in the<br>
CurveLayout library implements the full functionality using the ShapeWalker library<br>
described in my Graphical Truffles column in <i>develop</i> Issue 27. The ShapeWalker<br>
library is used to determine each individual line or curve segment of a shape; the<br>
distance from a hit point to each segment is determined and the smallest of them is<br>
chosen (code comments illustrate the method more completely).
</p>
<p>
<b>COMPUTING THE CARET IN CURVELAYOUT</b>
</p>
<p>
To compute the caret of a line layout, we call GXGetLayoutCaret. This returns a shape<br>
describing the insertion position. If we take the resulting shape and use it to dash the<br>
curve (with only one repetition), the result is the curve layout caret. It's that simple<br>
(see Listing 3).
</p>
<p>
______________________________
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 3. </b>Computing the curve layout caret
</p>
<pre>theFill = GXGetShapeFill(thePath);
realCaret = GXGetLayoutCaret(layout, offset, highlightType,
   caretType, nil);

// Copy into caret passed in (if it's nil, the right thing happens).
result = GXCopyToShape(caret, thePath);

GXSetShapePen(result, ff(1))      // We don't want dashes to scale.
theDash.attributes = gxBreakDash;
theDash.dash = realCaret;
theDash.advance = 0               // We want only one repeat.
theDash.phase = ff(0);
theDash.scale = ff(1);
GXSetShapeDash(result, &amp;theDash);

// Make sure we have a framed shape for the path.
if ((theFill != gxFrameFill) &amp;&amp; (theFill != gxClosedFrameFill))
   GXSetShapeFill(result, gxClosedFrameFill);

// Now apply the dash to get the caret on the path.
GXPrimitiveShape(result);
GXSetShapeDash(result, nil);
GXDisposeShape(realCaret);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
______________________________
</p>
<p>
<b>USING DASHING TO HIGHLIGHT IN CURVELAYOUT</b>
</p>
<p>
We can also use QuickDraw GX's dashing ability to highlight the individual characters<br>
in a curve layout. If we call GXGetLayoutHighlight for each individual character in a<br>
specified range, each resulting shape can be used to build up a dash shape. The dash<br>
shape built will have one contour per character, each contour representing the<br>
highlight of that character. If we then dash the curve with these contours, we get the<br>
desired effect.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, we <i>almost</i> get the desired effect -- while the result does highlight the curved<br>
layout's text, the highlight has gaps. Achieving a contiguous highlight is a more<br>
difficult problem. In fact, popular PostScript-based drawing applications highlight<br>
text on a path with noncontiguous regions. Figure 8 compares noncontiguous<br>
highlighting similar to that of many popular non-GX-based applications with the<br>
contiguous highlighting obtainable by QuickDraw GX using CurveLayout. The library<br>
supports both methods.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/296.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 8. </b>Two ways to highlight
</p>
<p>
The code in Listing 4 achieves the noncontiguous highlight of a curve layout. But we can<br>
do better: the CurveLayout library implements contiguous highlighting using<br>
QuickDraw GX's ability to do hairline dashing or bend dashing. Rather than going on and<br>
on, I'll let the code in the library speak for itself.
</p>
<p>

      hilightType, oneCharHighlight);
   if (oneCharHighlight != nil) {
      // Add highlight for individual character to highlight shape.

<h2>USING THE CURVELAYOUT LIBRARY</h2>
<p>
CurveLayout is designed to look very much like the line layout functions you're used to<br>
-- we want a curve layout to look as if it really were a new QuickDraw GX shape type.<br>
All of the editing routines take the same parameters as the corresponding line layout<br>
routines, so I won't spend too much time describing those. See <i>Inside Macintosh:</i><br>
<i>QuickDraw GX Typography</i> for more information. The most important functions in the<br>
CurveLayout library are as follows:
</p>
<pre>gxShape ClNewCurveLayout(gxShape theText, gxShape theShape);
void ClDisposeCurveLayout(gxShape curveLayout);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The ClNewCurveLayout function creates the curve layout shape. The input is a normal<br>
line layout shape and a curve. Actually, the second parameter can be any kind of shape:<br>
a line, a polygon, or a path. The resulting curve layout shape is the one that will be<br>
passed to the other library functions for editing. It's also the shape you'd draw and to<br>
which you can attach transforms for achieving rotation or other effects. The<br>
ClDisposeCurveLayout function destroys the shape.
</p>
<p>
Modification of the text in the layout (such as for editing) should be done on the layout<br>
shape passed in. The path can be changed as well. If either of the two input shapes is<br>
modified, you should call the ClChangedCurveLayout function before redrawing. For<br>
example, this function should be called for each character inserted or deleted from the<br>
original line layout shape.
</p>
<p>
The code accompanying this article also includes an application that demonstrates using<br>
the CurveLayout library. While I'll certify the actual CurveLayout library as ready<br>
for prime time, the test application is just a test application -- not a model of coding<br>
perfection! Also, as an extra bonus I've included the CurveLayoutGX control panel. This<br>
control panel adds the basic curve layout feature to all of your <i>existing</i> drawing<br>
applications by defining a key combination to activate it. (This is a bit of a hack; use it<br>
at your own risk.)
</p>
<p>
All of the functions of the library are documented (as is the CurveLayout code itself)<br>
in the header file, CurveLayout.h, so I won't go further into the API. See "Curve<br>
Measurement" for a few other details about the implementation.

<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CURVE MEASUREMENT</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current version of QuickDraw GX uses a numerical approximation for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certain&nbsp;&nbsp;functions that are relevant here. The particular functions relate to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;measurement of quadratic B&#200;zier curve segments and are used by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GXShapeLengthToPoint,&nbsp;&nbsp;by GXGetShapeLength, and&nbsp;&nbsp;for dashing as invoked by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either GXDrawShape or GXPrimitiveShape. The&nbsp;&nbsp;implementation of these was <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done as a numerical approximation to ensure sufficient performance on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;680x0&nbsp;&nbsp;machines, where the use of a closed mathematical equation would have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been too&nbsp;&nbsp;slow. The bad news is that while this method is accurate enough for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the original&nbsp;&nbsp;use intended (primarily dashing), it&#960;s not accurate enough to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;produce good-looking&nbsp;&nbsp;text along a curve.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you've seen in this article, the functions mentioned above are heavily used <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the CurveLayout library. The inaccuracies will manifest themselves as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;characters&nbsp;&nbsp;being spaced a little too far apart. To ensure high-quality text<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;layout, a library&nbsp;&nbsp;has been included with this article that reimplements the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;low-level quadratic segment&nbsp;&nbsp;measurement functions using a floating-point<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;closed equation. On top of that code,&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#960;ve built my own versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GXShapeLengthToPoint, GXGetShapeLength, and&nbsp;&nbsp;GXPrimitiveShape, called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AccurateShapeLengthToPoint, AccurateGetShapeLength,&nbsp;&nbsp;and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AccuratePrimitiveShape. Within AccuratePrimitiveShape is an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementation of&nbsp;&nbsp;all cases of dashing that the CurveLayout library requires.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other cases of&nbsp;&nbsp;PrimitiveShape are dispatched to GXPrimitiveShape; hence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this call isn&#960;t a complete&nbsp;&nbsp;replacement for GXPrimitiveShape. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CurveLayout.c file contains a compile-time&nbsp;&nbsp;conditional that can be defined to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the library code instead of the built-in&nbsp;&nbsp;QuickDraw GX code.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low-level math used by my library was written by Joseph Maurer. He<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;&nbsp;measurement routines that operate on individual quadratic curve<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;segments. I built&nbsp;&nbsp;the shape measurement and dashing functions by using the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ShapeWalker library&nbsp;&nbsp;described in my Graphical Truffles column in <i>develop</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 27 to extract individual&nbsp;&nbsp;segments from QuickDraw GX shapes.

<h2>LAYING IT ALL ON THE LINE</h2>
<p>
The library provided with this article should enable anybody writing a QuickDraw GX<br>
application to add high-quality typography drawn along an arbitrary curve. If you've<br>
already written code to edit QuickDraw GX line layouts, you'll find the API in this<br>
library very familiar. For those of you who haven't thought about writing a GX-based<br>
application, perhaps the simplicity of using CurveLayout as well as the quality<br>
demonstrated by the output of this code will make you give GX another look. Without<br>
QuickDraw GX, an application would have to include code similar to what's in the<br>
CurveLayout library in <i>addition</i> to the code the application would need to do ordinary<br>
line layout, not to mention all of the additional code that would be required in the<br>
application to print something like a curve layout shape.
</p>
<p>
CurveLayout provides developers with a way to provide distinctly superior user value<br>
in their applications, while reducing code size and complexity at the same time --<br>
what could be easier?
