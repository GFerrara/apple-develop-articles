<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>

<h1>CAROLINE ROSE</h1>
<p>
A couple of issues ago, I told a story here about how my friend John had failed to find<br>
some song lyrics on the Web before I managed to locate them by old-fashioned,<br>
real-world means.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few of you wrote to say how easily you found those same lyrics on<br>
the&nbsp;&nbsp;Web. Maybe they were posted after the incident I related , or maybe John just <br>
didn't look in the right place, but my point was a general one: the&nbsp;&nbsp;Web is not the<br>
world.
</p>
<p>
At first I thought that editorial would be controversial, but before it was published I<br>
noticed similar remarks starting to appear elsewhere, along the lines of the Internet<br>
and the&nbsp;&nbsp;Web being overrated. Since then I've seen even more critical articles on the<br>
subject -- the inevitable backlash, I suppose. Now that such kvetching has become<br>
socially acceptable, I should probably turn to another subject, but alas...
</p>
<p>
My main complaint is with the quality of a lot of what's posted online. I don' t mind so<br>
much if someone's personal home page is a bit rough, but lar ge corporations that<br>
should do better seem not to be doing even minimal copyediting and fact checking on<br>
what they post to the&nbsp;&nbsp;Web. It's gotten to the point where, to some people, being<br>
published on the Internet is becoming synonymous with being low quality. I even came<br>
across this sentiment in a review of a book (not related to computers) in the New <br>
York Times: after criticizing the book for sloppy editing, the reviewer wrote, "If this<br>
is the way books are going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;published, we may as well just shove the typing onto<br>
the Internet and for get about bound volumes altogether."
</p>
<p>
Why is it that the highest-quality online publications are those that are also published<br>
in print? It's as if "committing" something to&nbsp;&nbsp;print makes it seem more respectable,<br>
more enduring. As a provider of not only develop content but also a newsletter of my<br>
own on the&nbsp;&nbsp;Web, I find this ironic. Ever since my publications have been made so<br>
easily available online, reader feedback indicates that many more people have been<br>
referring to back issues; they treat all the content -- past and present -- as a single,<br>
timeless body of&nbsp;&nbsp;information. This timelessness argues for the same attention to<br>
quality online as in the print medium, or at least for more efforts in that direction.
</p>
<p>
I think one problem may be the confusion about where to put&nbsp;&nbsp;Web publishing in an<br>
organization. Most Web-related job descriptions I've seen ask for a content provider,<br>
formatter/designer, and HTML expert all rolled into one. That's like having authors of<br>
develop articles design the page layout and produce the printed product. Ask one person<br>
to do it all and what do you expect?
</p>
<p>
You may not care about minor errors, but inattention to quality will extend, web-like,<br>
beyond punctuation and grammar into the more critical realms of coherency and<br>
accuracy. So please, take a second look at your Web pages and other online content with<br>
this in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;The world will thank you.

<b>CAROLINE ROSE</b> (crose@apple.com, AppleLink CROSE) finds her most difficult editing<br>
job to be rephrasing her work history for her bio in develop. There are only so many<br>
ways to say she's been working in the computer industry for a very long time, in<br>
various writing, editing, and programming capacities. The good news is that, having<br>
edited develop for five years, she finally qualifies for a sabbatical, which she'll be<br>
taking by the time you read this. She's sorry to miss Apple's Worldwide Developers<br>
Conference but&nbsp;&nbsp;decided that springtime in Tuscany was a fair tradeoff. *
