<h2>LETTERS</h2>
<b>WEB FIRST, THEN PRINTED COPY</b><br>
<i>d e v e l o p </i> is absolutely the coolest publication for a Mac developer. I thought I would<br>
drop a line to say "thanks" for putting the next issue up on the&nbsp;&nbsp;Web a full month<br>
before it will arrive at my home.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least this way I can get a partial fix! Good job!<br>
-- Rob Newberry<br>
<p>
I just noticed that you've released <i>d e v e l o p </i> Issue 24 online. I'm a subscriber, yet I<br>
have to call or send e-mail to you each time to remind you to send my issue! Your<br>
magazine is terrific, but the service is quite the opposite.<br>
-- Carl Limisco
</p>
<p>
<i>As a service to developers who may want access to content as soon as it's finalized,</i><br>
<i>develop content is uploaded to the Web within three days of issue completion.&nbsp;&nbsp;The</i><br>
<i>print and CD-ROM production processes, however, consume more time&nbsp;&nbsp;and thus</i><br>
<i>result in the delay between when you may first see content on the&nbsp;&nbsp;Web and when you</i><br>
<i>receive your copy with its CD in the mail.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>In the case of Issue 24, this period was extended due to technical dif ficulties with</i><br>
<i>generating the mailing information. Starting with Issue 23, we switched to APDA for</i><br>
<i>distribution of develop. There have been a few snags in the transition,&nbsp;&nbsp;but we're</i><br>
<i>confident that subscribers will experience improved service. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;we</i><br>
<i>apologize for any problems.</i><br>

<b>PUZZLE PAGE SLIP-UP</b><br>
When I received develop Issue 24, I was shocked to find a bug in the Puzzle Page. <br>
When BAL is explain- ing how LockPixels and UnlockPixels work, he mentions that the<br>
PixMap baseAddr can be either a&nbsp;&nbsp;handle or a pointer, and that a flag in rowBytes<br>
identifies which state the baseAddr is in.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is wrong; that information is stored in<br>
the pmVersion field of the PixMap.&nbsp;&nbsp;There aren't any bits to spare in rowBytes. Other<br>
than that, it was a great Puzzle Page, as usual.<br>
-- Cameron Esfahani
</p>
<p>
<i>You're right; you caught this slip-up by the puzzlemeisters themselves. Say, if you're</i><br>
<i>so good, why not write your own Puzzle Page? [Readers: See the puzzle Cameron</i><br>
<i>coauthors in this issue.]</i><br>

<b>MULTIPANE FIXES -- AND ABOUT USING OUR CODE</b><br>
The code accompanying Norman Franke's article on multipane dialogs (develop Issue<br>
23) is great. I had it up and running in a PowerPlant application in less than an hour.<br>
But I found some bugs; for example, in the routines T2PMPDAction and friends, you<br>
lock down theData, and I suspect you should be locking down tmpData. Before I get down<br>
and dirty, I was wondering if y ou knew of any other bugs already pre - sent.
</p>
<p>
Also, the code needs an extra routine&nbsp;&nbsp;to generate the data handle without displaying the<br>
dialog so that one might set the initial values (as opposed to using factory defaults).
</p>
<p>
When I get the PowerPlant classes working and debugged, I'd like to distribute them on<br>
the Internet (free). May I include your code (possibly modified)? Again, thanks for a<br>
great article.
</p>
<p>
-- Gordon Watts
</p>
<p>
<i>Norman has provided a newer version of his code as of Issue 24's CD. He' s fixed a lot of</i><br>
<i>bugs and also now provides PowerPlant classes; see the README file for details.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>You may redistribute the MPDialogs source if you like, as long as it's part of your own</i><br>
<i>thing and not just a redistribution of the original package. For instance, you'll</i><br>
<i>probably not be distributing Norman' s sample or its source, but just the files</i><br>
<i>MPDialogs.c and MPDialogs.h. Please include a pointer to where they came from, since</i><br>
<i>presumably the code will change over time (bug fixes and so on).</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>By the way, you can contact Norman directly at franke@eworld.com.</i><br>

<h2>TECHNOTES AND Q&amp;AS: BETTER THAN EVER</h2>
<p>
The observant among you will notice a change in&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical Notes on this issue's CD<br>
(and on the&nbsp;&nbsp;World Wide Web and the other myriad places where they can be found). <br>
The old Macintosh Technical Notes are still around, but now there are also new Notes,<br>
going simply by the name "Technotes."&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Notes will eventually evolve into the<br>
new scheme. We talked with Technote leader Tom Maremaa, from Apple's Developer<br>
Technical Support group, for the scoop on this.
</p>
<p>
"The old Notes have a rich and varied history at&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple, and have served developers<br>
well in the past,"&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom said. "We wanted to continue that tradition -- but with<br>
changes, something on the order of&nbsp;&nbsp;Technotes: The Next Generation."
</p>
<p>
First, Tom hopes you'll agree that the biggest improvement is in the quality of the new<br>
Technotes. They receive far more review by Apple engineers than the old Notes did, and<br>
they're better edited and formatted, so you should find them a lot more readable and<br>
reliable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Technotes will also be timelier: more of them will focus on hot new <br>
technologies, such as QuickTime VR and QuickDraw 3D, with updates and additions<br>
posted regularly on the Web athttp://dev.info.apple.com/technotes/Main.html.&nbsp;&nbsp;They'll<br>
migrate to develop's CD and other such locations, but you'll no longer have to wait that<br>
long for the latest and greatest information.
</p>
<p>
You'll notice that Technotes are numbered sequentially, starting from 1001, rather<br>
than divided into functional&nbsp;&nbsp;categories. Tom found that placing a Note into a single <br>
category was becoming increasingly difficult and arbitrary; often a topic would span<br>
more than one category or wouldn't quite fit into any existing category. Locating a Note<br>
on a&nbsp;&nbsp;particular subject is easier than ever thanks to the improved searching tools that<br>
are now available: you can use&nbsp;&nbsp;Acrobat's search mechanism on the CD or the excellent<br>
search facility provided on&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple's Web pages.
</p>
<p>
"Providing developers with the ability to search fast and ef fectively through the whole<br>
body of&nbsp;&nbsp;Technotes, particularly on the Web," said Tom, "has been a major goal in the<br>
project. It's there now. Check it out!"
</p>
<p>
The old Macintosh Technical Notes are gradually being cleaned up: over time they'll be<br>
updated and worked into the new scheme, or deleted if obsolete. Should you look for an<br>
old Note by category and number, you'll find a "stub" indicating its current status if<br>
it's been revised or removed. In particular, the old Q&amp;A Technical Notes are being dis-<br>
continued; new Q&amp;As are being released as "Macintosh&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical Q&amp;As"&nbsp;&nbsp;(they're on<br>
the Web athttp://dev.info.apple.com/techqa/Main.html).
</p>
<p>
For those of you who like to have Notes in printed form, you can still order a printed<br>
copy (of both the old and the new Notes). See the Technotes Web page or the latest<br>
Apple Developer Catalog for details.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Tom would like to point out that&nbsp;&nbsp;Technotes can be submitted by outside<br>
authors (although Caroline asks that you first consider whether develop might be a<br>
more appropriate vehicle for your handiwork :-). If your Note is&nbsp;&nbsp;published, you'll<br>
receive YATS (Yet Another T-Shirt) along with some other goodies, including a chance<br>
to participate in Apple developer kitchens and other special events. For more<br>
information, or just to let us know what you think of all these changes, write to<br>
AppleLink DEVFEEDBACK (devfeedback@applelink.apple.com).

<p>
SEND US YOUR EXCUSE FOR NOT WRITING Well, actually, we'd rather receive letters<br>
regarding articles published in develop.&nbsp;&nbsp;Letters should be addressed to Caroline Rose<br>
-- or, if technical develop-related questions, to Dave Johnson -- at&nbsp;&nbsp;AppleLink CROSE<br>
or JOHNSON.DK (Internet crose@applelink.apple.com or dkj@apple.com).&nbsp;&nbsp;All letters<br>
should include your name and company name as well as your address and phone<br>
number. Letters may be excerpted or edited for clarity (or to make them say what we<br>
wish they did). Please send all&nbsp;&nbsp;subscription-related queries to AppleLink APDA<br>
(Internet apda@applelink.apple.com). *
