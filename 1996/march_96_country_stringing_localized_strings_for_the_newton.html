<p>
<i>Newton products are currently available localized for English, French, German, and</i><br>
<i>Swedish. Thus, to take full advantage of the market, Newton applications must be</i><br>
<i>developed for four languages. As of Newton Toolkit version 1.5, there's a mechanism</i><br>
<i>for localizing strings at compile time but no built-in support for organizing all the</i><br>
<i>categories of strings across the different languages (unlike on the Macintosh, where</i><br>
<i>you can use resources). This article presents a couple of ways to organize localized</i><br>
<i>strings in your Newton application.</i>
</p>
<p>
Until Newton Toolkit 1.5, developing an application for English, French, German, and<br>
Swedish required four different application projects or many skanky contortions. This<br>
was tedious, to say the least, but necessary for those who wanted to take full advantage<br>
of the worldwide market for Newton products.
</p>
<p>
Newton Toolkit 1.5 provides support (with the SetLocalizationFrame and LocObj calls)<br>
for localizing your applications from just one project. But this is useful only at<br>
compile time, and it doesn't provide an infrastructure for organizing and categorizing<br>
the localized objects. In other words, you can have different strings for four locales,<br>
but how you keep track of what strings you have and which ones need localizing is up to<br>
you. Macintosh developers don't have this problem because all strings can reside in<br>
resources; changing the strings in the resources changes them in the application.
</p>
<p>
This article presents two ways to organize your localized strings. Both methods are<br>
meant to be used at compile time, but there's also information on changing strings at<br>
run time. Before reading this article, you should be familiar with the information in<br>
the <i>Newton Programmer's Guide</i> on localizing Newton applications.
</p>
<h2>STRINGING YOU ALONG WITHOUT RESOURCES</h2>
<p>
In a Macintosh application you can keep localized strings in the 'STR#' resource of the<br>
resource fork. This isn't an option in a Newton application for two reasons: ResEdit<br>
doesn't directly support Unicode strings, and, more important, a Newton application<br>
doesn't have a resource fork. All your strings have to reside somewhere in your<br>
application package.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A first cut at a solution to the problem of how to organize localized strings in your<br>
Newton application would be to have a viewSetupFormScript or TextSetup method<br>
(where applicable) that sets a particular string based on some application-global<br>
setting. This solution has several disadvantages, such as spreading localized strings<br>
throughout the code (resulting in multiple copies of strings) and requiring all strings<br>
for all countries to be included.
</p>
<p>
If you've programmed the Newton for a while, you might think of taking advantage of<br>
dead code stripping and using an if statement that switches on a compile-time constant.<br>
This would eliminate unused localized strings but is still awkward.
</p>
<p>
The best idea is a technique that lets you keep all your strings together. You can do this<br>
by defining a frame in your Project Data with one slot per string that you want to<br>
localize. You can even use nested frames. For example:
</p>
<pre>constant kUSStrings := '{
   AppName:      "World Ready!",
   ExtrasName:   "World!",
   HelloWorld:   "Hello World",
   Dialogs: {
      OK:      "OK",
      Cancel:   "Cancel",
      Yes:      "Yes",
      No:      "No",
   },
};
constant kFrenchStrings := ...</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In Newton Toolkit 1.5 and later, you can use this frame with SetLocalizationFrame.<br>
Unfortunately, there's no specification for how to build up the frame, which is<br>
essential to organizing your strings in a sane way. Also, SetLocalizationFrame is meant<br>
only for compile-time localizations. With some extra effort you can organize the<br>
strings in a way that allows them to be localized at run time as well. As the next<br>
section shows, the key is using the Load command in combination with a few constant<br>
functions.
</p>
<h2>LINGUA FRAMA -- CREATING THE LANGUAGES FRAME</h2>
<p>
In the previous section, we defined a frame that can be used for each target language.<br>
Each of those target language frames can be nested into an outer frame, called the<br>
<i>languages frame</i>. Each target language subframe contains the localized strings in that<br>
language. These subframes can in turn contain other subframes, enabling you to group<br>
strings into logical categories such as strings used in filing, strings used in searching,<br>
and so on. Each of the frames at the top level of the languages frame must have the same<br>
structure. If you have a path in the USEnglish frame of Entries.Names.Phones.Home,<br>
that path will also need to exist in French, German, and any other languages your<br>
application supports.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall structure of the languages frame is as follows:
</p>
<pre>{USEnglish: {
   AppName:   "World Ready!",
   Dialogs: {
      Cancel:   "Cancel",
      OK:      "OK",
      // ... and so on
   },
 French: {
   AppName:   "Pr&amp;ecirc;t pour le Monde!",
   Dialogs: {
      OK:      "OK",
      Cancel:   "Annuler",
      // ... and so on
   },
 German: {
   AppName:   "Welt Ready!",
   Dialogs: {
      OK:      "OK",
      Cancel:   "Absagen",
      // ... and so on
   },
 // ... and so on
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This is the format of the frame you would pass to SetLocalizationFrame as well as of a<br>
constant that can be used in runtime localization. Typically, the languages frame would<br>
be kept in a text file or in your Project Data. The problem with this is that the frame<br>
is rather large, and adding or changing an entry in a language subframe can be<br>
difficult. Also, several entries are identical (such as the string for OK).
</p>
<p>
A better solution is to separate the localized strings by category. This article uses the<br>
target languages as the categories, though you could also employ similar techniques<br>
with other categories. Once the strings are split, you can use the Load command to<br>
assemble the languages frame.
</p>
<p>
There are two main schemes for organizing the strings. One uses simple text files and<br>
works on both the Mac OS and Windows platforms. The other uses compile-time<br>
functions to read the strings from some other format; on the Macintosh platform, this<br>
method can be used to construct the languages frame from a resource file. We'll look at<br>
each of these methods in turn.
</p>
<p>
<b>LOADING FROM TEXT FILES</b>
</p>
<p>
In the first scheme, you separate each language into a different text file. Remember<br>
that Load will return the result of the last statement it executes in the specified file.<br>
This means that each text file will specify one frame. For example, the contents of<br>
your French text file might look like this:
</p>
<pre>{
   AppName:   "Pr&amp;ecirc;t pour le Monde!",
   Dialogs: {
      OK:      "OK",
      Cancel:   "Annuler",
      // ... and so on
   }
};</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You could then modify your Project Data to build the localization frame:
</p>
<pre>SetLocalizationFrame({French: Load(HOME &amp; "FrenchStrings.f"), ...</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
It's also helpful to have some string constants that can be used in multiple places. A<br>
good example is the string for OK, which is the same in some languages. To do this, you<br>
should load some general constants before constructing the individual languages that<br>
make up the languages frame. So the overall process for building the languages frame<br>
would be as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Load a file of string constants.</li>
<li>Construct an empty languages frame.</li>
<li>For each language, build the individual target language frame and add it to<br>
the languages frame.</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>You only need predefined constants</b> if you aren't using object<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;combination. Object combination, a feature that exists as of Newton Toolkit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;version 1.6, would solve the problem of multiple instances of a single string<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(such as "OK").*
</p>
<p>
The above description smells of an algorithm. Since you can run NewtonScript at<br>
compile time, you can call a function to load a languages frame from text files (see<br>
Listing 1). The main trick of this function is that it uses the language symbol to create<br>
a pathname for Load.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1. </b>CreateLanguagesFrameFromText
</p>
<pre>global CreateLanguagesFrameFromText(GlobalsFilePath,
    LanguagesSymArray)
begin
   if GlobalsFilePath then
      Load(GlobalsFilePath);
  
   local langFrame := {};

   foreach sym in LanguagesSymArray do
      langFrame.(sym) := Load(HOME &amp; sym &amp; "Strings.f");
   langFrame;
end;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You can define this function in a text file (say, WorldStrings.f) that you add to your<br>
project. Note that you must compile this file before you load your international<br>
strings.
</p>
<p>
You could use the languages frame directly as the argument to SetLocalizationFrame;<br>
however, as we'll see later in this article, there are better ways to use the frame.
</p>
<p>
<b>LOADING FROM RESOURCES</b>
</p>
<p>
The second scheme creates the languages frame from a resource file. You can apply the<br>
methodology to other non-text file sources as well. To take advantage of the code below,<br>
you'll need Newton Toolkit 1.6 or later. One important point: all of this code works<br>
only for Roman-based languages.
</p>
<p>
To make life easier, we'll define a template in ResEdit that shows all the localized<br>
versions of a particular string. The template defines a resource of type 'LOC#', which<br>
is loosely based on the 'STR#' resource (see Table 1). Because we're using a template,<br>
the number of languages must be defined in advance; we'll choose 5 as a nice arbitrary<br>
number. You can find the 'LOC#' template in the sample code on this issue's CD.
</p>
<p>
You can now use the 'LOC#' resource to enter all of your strings, grouped into<br>
categories that make sense to you. The advantage of this resource is that the path<br>
expression in the languages frame and all localized strings for that path expression are<br>
grouped together.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/182.gif" width="294 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
You may be wondering why the 'LOC#' template contains an English string. If you use<br>
LocObj, the first argument is a string that's taken as the English localization. For the<br>
case where you're only localizing at compile time, the English string is redundant. But<br>
if you want to localize at run time, you'll need the English string around.
</p>
<p>
If you're familiar with the resource calls in the Newton Toolkit, you will have spotted<br>
a potential problem: there's no way to query for the available resource IDs of a<br>
particular resource. The basic solution to this problem is to try reading a resource<br>
and to catch the exception that the Newton Toolkit throws if the resource isn't present.<br>
Unfortunately, iterating through all possible resource IDs while catching exceptions<br>
takes several minutes.
</p>
<p>
So we impose these restrictions: there can be any number of 'LOC#' resources but they<br>
must be numbered consecutively, and the first resource ID must be either 0 (because<br>
programmatically generated resources are likely to start with 0) or 128 (because<br>
those created in ResEdit will start with 128). The code in Listing 2 generates an array<br>
of resources of a given type based on these criteria.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 2.</b> GetAllResources
</p>
<pre>global GetAllResources(ResType, NewtType)
begin
   local result := [];
   local atID := 0;

   // See if we can read in resource ID 0. If so, increment the
   // next resource ID; if not, set the ID to 128.
   try
      AddArraySlot(result, GetResource(ResType, atID, NewtType));
      atID := 1;
   onexception |evt.ex.msg| do
      atID := 128;
     
   // Start at the current resource ID (either 1 or 128) and
   // continue reading in resources until an exception occurs.
   loop
   begin
      try
         AddArraySlot(result, GetResource(ResType, atID, NewtType));
         atID := atID + 1;
      onexception |evt.ex.msg| do
         break;
   end;
   result;
end;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Once you have an array of 'LOC#' resources, you need to parse these resources into<br>
NewtonScript path expressions and strings. The code in Listing 3 gets all the 'LOC#'<br>
resources and generates a languages frame.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 3. </b>CreateLanguagesFrameFromRsrc
</p>
<pre>global CreateLanguagesFrameFromRsrc(ResFilePath, LanguagesSymArray)
begin
   // Throw if there aren't exactly 5 languages.
   if Length(LanguagesSymArray) &lt;&gt; 5 then
      Throw('|evt.ex.msg|,
         "The LanguagesSymArray must be exactly 5 elements long.");

   // The languages frame array that will be returned
   local langFrame := {};
   foreach sym in LanguagesSymArray do
      langFrame.(sym) := {};
     
   // Could use a constant since currently must be exactly 5
   // languages.
   local numLanguages := Length(LanguagesSymArray);
   local r := OpenResFileX(ResFilePath);
   local locResourceArray := GetAllResources("LOC#", 'binaryObject);

   /* Process the LOC# resources. The format of the resource is:
      16-bit count of number of string sets
      string set 1
      string set 2...
      string set n
      string set:
         pathexpression as C string
         English as C string
         French as C string
         German as C string
         other1 as C string
         other2 as C string
   */
  
   local numStringSets;
   local pathExpr;
   local tempString;
   local atIndex;
  
   foreach locResource in locResourceArray do
   begin
      // Get the number of string sets.
      numStringSets := ExtractWord(locResource, 0);
     
      atIndex := 2;

      // Grab each string set.
      for stringSet := 1 to numStringSets do
      begin
         // Grab the C string that is the path.
         pathExpr := ExtractCString(locResource, atIndex);

         // Update index counter.
         atIndex := atIndex + StrLen(pathExpr) + 1;

         // Create path expression for following strings.
         pathExpr := call Compile("'" &amp; pathExpr) with ();

         // Get the language strings and jam them.
         // WARNING: This code will ignore zero-length strings.
         // There are rare cases where you actually want an empty
         // string for a particular translation; in this case, you
         // could modify the code to throw an evt.ex.msg with the
         // appropriate error.
         foreach langSym in LanguagesSymArray do
         begin
            tempString := ExtractCString(locResource, atIndex);
            if StrLen(tempString) &gt; 0 then
               langFrame.(langSym).(pathExpr) := tempString;
            atIndex := atIndex + Length(tempString) + 1;
         end;
      end;
   end;

   CloseResFileX(r);
   langFrame;
end;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Unlike the text method, the resource method has to assume a certain number of base<br>
languages. The first thing the code does is to check that there are exactly five language<br>
symbols. If not, the code throws an exception. The result is a typical Newton Toolkit<br>
error dialog with the string specified in the code.
</p>
<p>
In reality, we could be a bit more forgiving. The code won't create entries in the<br>
languages array for items that are empty strings. So if a developer were careful not to<br>
fill out entries for particular languages, the restriction could be relaxed to <i>no more</i><br>
<i>than</i> five languages. You could also make the code a bit more complex and just not add<br>
strings for undefined languages. This is left as an exercise for the masochistic reader.
</p>
<p>
An even better approach would be to create some other resource (say 'LOCi') that<br>
contains information on how many languages are defined by the 'LOC#' template and the<br>
language symbols. It would require slightly more complex code for<br>
CreateLanguagesFrameFromRsrc, but it would provide more flexibility later on. The<br>
CD contains modified code that uses an 'LOCi' resource.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, this is considerably more complex than the function used for text files.<br>
Also note that this methodology can't use constants for common strings. There are ways<br>
to massage the data to use constants, but that's left as another exercise for the reader.
</p>
<h2>PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER</h2>
<p>
Once you've created the languages frame, you can use SetLocalizationFrame and LocObj<br>
in your project to localize your strings. The sample on this issue's CD (Compile Time<br>
Strings) uses the code shown in Listing 4. This code is more general than you may<br>
need, in that it creates the frame from either text files or resources. The last line sets<br>
up a constant for the English (that is, the default) language frame. You can use the<br>
constant English strings as part of the first argument to LocObj.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The LocObj mechanism can be used</b> with any object, not just strings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article looks only at strings, though the text-based method will work for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most types of objects.*
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 4.</b> Calling SetLocalizationFrame
</p>
<pre>// Create the languages frame, either by text or by resource.
constant kFromText := nil;

// Create the kLanguagesArray constant for the languages.
// The text method requires only as many languages as there are
// text files; the resource method requires a 5-element array.
DefConst('kLanguagesArray,
   call func(isText)
      if isText then
         '[English, French, German];
      else
         '[English, French, German, Other1, Other2]
      with (kFromText));

if kFromText then
   DefConst('kLangFrame,
      CreateLanguagesFrameFromText(
         HOME &amp; "StringsCommon.f", kLanguagesArray));
else
   DefConst('kLangFrame,
      CreateLanguagesFrameFromRsrc(
         HOME &amp; "strings.rsrc", kLanguagesArray));

SetLocalizationFrame(kLangFrame);

// Define a constant for the English language frame.
constant kStrings := kLangFrame.English;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You're probably wondering why we don't create a wrapper function to generate the<br>
correct LocObj call. Unfortunately, LocObj is a special type of call in the Newton<br>
Toolkit; it's evaluated as soon as the compiler hits it and it must return a constant<br>
value.
</p>
<h2>CHANGING STRINGS AT RUN TIME</h2>
<p>
The LocObj mechanism is designed for compile-time customization of your application.<br>
In other words, the LocObj function exists only in the compile-time environment of<br>
the Newton Toolkit; you can use it only in places that will be evaluated at compile time.<br>
In some circumstances you may want to change localized strings at run time. One<br>
example would be a language translator application where you want the interface<br>
strings to be displayed in the current source language.
</p>
<p>
The raw data for the runtime strings exists in the languages frame. The frame can be<br>
included in your package so that you have access to all the localized strings. This will<br>
add a significant amount of space to your package; at worst, it will take up two bytes<br>
per character in the unique strings, plus the storage occupied by the symbols and<br>
frame structure.
</p>
<p>
You'll need to add some runtime support for switching language elements of the<br>
interface. The main task is to decide what views need to be updated when a language is<br>
switched. The simplest way to do this is to recursively propagate a conditional message<br>
send through the application's view children:
</p>
<pre>// In application base view ...
myApp.PropagateLanguageChange := func()
begin
   // ... conditionally recur through all the kids.
   foreach child in :ChildViewFrames() do
      // "x.y exists" only checks for y using proto inheritance.
      if child.PropagateLanguageChange exists then
         child:PropagateLanguageChange();
end;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This code won't send to all children. To do that you would remove the <b>exists</b> test and<br>
just send the message, which will always be found since the top-level parent defines<br>
it. If you make this change, you should add some sort of conditional check for a message<br>
that does the real work of updating (like "if child.DoLanguageChange exists then ...").
</p>
<p>
An alternative is to keep track of which views need updates. How you do it depends on<br>
your application's structure. Typically, you would maintain an array of the declared<br>
views that need updating. If the views that need updating are well known, you're better<br>
off using the latter method.
</p>
<p>
Each view that requires an update will need to perform three tasks: change the text<br>
based on the source language; usually change the viewBounds based on the new text; and<br>
redraw or refresh based on the new viewBounds and text. Since it's very likely that the<br>
viewBounds will change, most of the work can be done in the viewSetupFormScript<br>
method of the view. Remember that redisplaying with a new viewBounds requires<br>
sending a SyncView, which has the side effect of sending all viewSetup messages.
</p>
<p>
This means that you can use the SyncView call as your message to indicate that the<br>
source language has changed. When a view opens by normal means it will also use the<br>
correct source language. Note that in some cases you may want to use RedoChildren,<br>
which has the same basic effect as SyncView sent to all children.
</p>
<p>
One caveat is that both SyncView and RedoChildren are expensive calls. You should<br>
limit the places where the language can change. An example of runtime customization<br>
(Run Time Strings) is provided on the CD.
</p>
<h2>READY TO ROCK AND ROLL</h2>
<p>
With the code from this article, you can now make all your applications world ready. If<br>
you're just starting an application, take the time and use LocObj where you should. If<br>
you already have a project, retrofit it. Then take the code samples, customize them to<br>
your heart's content, and code away. Today English, tomorrow the world.
