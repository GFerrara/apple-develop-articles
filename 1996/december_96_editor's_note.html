<h1>CAROLINE ROSE</h1>
<p>
Regular readers of develop may know that, while I always use the latest hardware and<br>
software at work, my home system is woefully out of date -- at least it was until I<br>
recently upgraded to a Power Mac. The initial setup wasn't too hard, once I got used to<br>
flipping back and forth between the&nbsp;&nbsp;manual for the computer, the manual for the<br>
monitor, and the online updates; when all else failed, I relied on common sense. But<br>
when I moved beyond hardware setup into software installation, it seemed as if I was<br>
expected to know much more than I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;The modem software installer, for example,<br>
would just name a software module and say "click OK if you want to install this," with<br>
no mention of which module(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;provided the basic modem capabilities (which is all I<br>
wanted).&nbsp;&nbsp;What to do? I recently had this same feeling while trying to learn a new<br>
e-mail application at work: though I immediately saw how to address mail to anyone on<br>
any network in the known world with barely a keystroke, I couldn't tell how to simply<br>
enter an address for someone here at Apple. In these and many similar cases I've<br>
encountered recently, I couldn't figure out how to perform basic application functions<br>
without the intervention of an experienced user. The manuals and online help were<br>
somewhat helpful, but they were limited by the design of the software, which was the<br>
problem in the first place. Common sense was no help at all.
</p>
<p>
Naturally I griped about this to my " friends in the industry." I think one of them hit<br>
the nail on the head when he said the problem is that too many products are being<br>
designed by experts who, consciously or not, design for experts. Designing with<br>
experts in mind ends up complicating everything, even the features that should be sim<br>
- ple. Bud Tribble, when he managed the software group at NeXT, used to tell<br>
programmers, "Simple things should be simple, and complex things should be<br>
possible." It seems increasingly true these days that designers are trying to make<br>
complex things simple, but as a result are making simple things complex. Design by<br>
experts for experts is not the answer: developers need to find out what real users<br>
want, and focus on their needs.
</p>
<p>
Is develop guilty of a similar problem? When I looked at the feedback we gathered at <br>
Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference this year, I noticed that some develop<br>
readers are asking for more entry-level articles, saying that a lot of what we publish<br>
is over their heads. While we're limited by what types of articles are submitted to us<br>
for publication, the develop Review Board does get to say which ones are accepted or<br>
not, and the Board is largely made up of "expert" programmers. Do we consequently<br>
tend to decide in favor of the more advanced articles? We'll keep an eye out for this<br>
from now on.

I often recall the days when Steve Jobs envisioned that the Macintosh would be as easy<br>
to&nbsp;&nbsp;use as a home appliance. Sure, we don't want to go back to that first oversimplified<br>
product, but maybe we should all&nbsp;&nbsp;ponder whether we've gone a bit too far in the<br>
opposite direction. I'd like to believe there' s still a&nbsp;&nbsp;place for common sense.

<b>CAROLINE ROSE</b> (crose@apple.com) has been a Mac enthusiast ever since she started<br>
writing the original Inside Macintosh in 1982. After a reorganization that suddenly<br>
changed the entire managerial hierarchy above her (up to and including Steve Jobs),<br>
she left Apple, but like so many other formerly disgruntled employees, she eventually<br>
returned.&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, again, a reorg happened that changed the entire managerial<br>
hierarchy above Caroline.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least there's some stability in her home life, where her<br>
cat Cleo remains the boss after 15 long years. *
