<i style="font-size:125%;">The MPW Shell contains a full-strength, high-speed text editor</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">with scripting capabilities. It's nothing to write love letters with,</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">because it's targeted at the ASCII format of compiler source files,</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">but it provides the power to automate complex and repetitive tasks</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">in ASCII text. The key to the system lies in a few editing-related</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">commands, together with its regular expressions and selection</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">expressions.</i>
</p>
<h1>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS</h1>
<p>
In the MPW Shell, any search command can take one of two kinds of arguments. The<br>
first is a plain string, which matches exactly its contents and nothing else, using a<br>
simple character-by-character match. The other is a regular expression, which is a<br>
pattern that can be recognized by a finite state machine. You can't parse programming<br>
languages with regular expressions, but you can use them to recognize many patterns,<br>
including wildcards, repeating sequences, and sets of characters. Regular expressions<br>
are bracketed with either slashes or backslashes, for searching forward or backward<br>
respectively. So, for instance, the regular expression \wombat\ would search<br>
backward from the current location for the string "wombat".
</p>
<p>
There are about 20 special constructs within regular expressions, all of which are<br>
cryptically described when you execute the command line "Help Patterns" within the<br>
MPW Shell. I'll mention some of the more useful ones here. The wildcard characters<br>
are the question mark (?) and the equivalence symbol (~, Option-X). The question<br>
mark matches any one character except the end of a line, while the equivalence symbol<br>
matches any number of such characters. For instance, /w?mb~t/ would match<br>
"wombat" as well as "wambiklort" and "wymbt", but not "wafkambiliot", nor "wkmb"<br>
at the end of a line. Restricted sets of symbols can be given in brackets; for instance,<br>
you can search for alphanumeric characters with the pattern [a-zA-Z0-9]. The<br>
reverse of a set can be specified with the "not" symbol (~, Option-L); for instance,<br>
/[~a-z]/ finds any character except a lowercase letter. The start of a line can be<br>
specified with the bullet symbol (<b>*</b>, Option-8) and the end of a line with the infinity<br>
symbol ([[infinity]], Option-5).
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These keyboard shortcuts are for American QWERTY keyboards. Other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keyboards have different layouts. For instance, on a direct neural interface<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keyboard, think "blue wildebeest" and raise your right ear to type the bullet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;symbol.*
</p>
<p>
Repeating patterns can be specified in three ways. Following any pattern with a plus<br>
sign (+) means one or more instances of that pattern; for instance, the regular<br>
expression /[0-9]+/ would match any sequence of digits. An optional repeating<br>
pattern can be similarly specified with an asterisk (*), which means zero or more<br>
repetitions. The rarely seen double angle brackets can be used to specify exactly how<br>
many repetitions of a pattern are allowed. They're typed as Option-backslash (<<) and<br>
Option-Shift-backslash (>>) and enclose a single number to mean exactly that many<br>
repetitions, or two numbers separated by a comma to specify a minimum and<br>
maximum number of repetitions, or a single number followed by a comma to mean at<br>
least that many repetitions. For instance, the pattern /[a-zA-Z]<<3,7>>/ would find<br>
all strings composed of alphabetical characters and from three to seven letters long.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of ways of "escaping" special characters when you want to look for<br>
something that has special meaning within regular expressions, such as a question<br>
mark or plus sign. You can escape any character with the lowercase delta<br>
([[partialdiff]], Option-D), or use single or double quotes to escape strings. To find<br>
the string "wombat+", for instance, you'd need to escape the plus sign:<br>
/wombat[[partialdiff]]+/.
</p>
<p>
Finally, one of the most useful constructs consists of a tagged regular expression. This<br>
allows you to associate a number between 0 and 9 with a pattern that's matched,<br>
referring to it later with the "registered" symbol (reg., Option-R) followed by a digit.<br>
This is very handy when you're doing replacements. For instance, you can replace any<br>
angle-bracketed string with a parenthesized string with the following command, which<br>
would turn "&lt;wombat&gt;" into "(wombat)":
</p>
<pre>Replace /&lt;([~&lt;&gt;]*)reg.1&gt;/ (reg.1)</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This searches for any number of characters (except angle brackets) that are between<br>
angle brackets, assigns them the number 1, and then replaces the angle brackets with<br>
parentheses. Note that the syntax of tagged patterns requires the pattern to be<br>
parenthesized.
</p>
<h1>SELECTION EXPRESSIONS</h1>
<p>
Many editing commands (such as Replace) can take selection expressions as well as<br>
regular expressions. Selection expressions provide more ways to select text than the<br>
string matching provided by regular expressions. Common selection expressions<br>
include the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The bullet symbol, meaning the start of a file.</li>
<li>The infinity symbol, meaning the end of a file.</li>
<li>The current selection, denoted by [[section]] (Option-6). This might<br>
have been selected with the mouse or by a Find command. [[section]] by itself<br>
indicates the selection in the target window (which I'll explain later), while<br>
pathname:[[section]] means the selection in the file indicated by the pathname.</li>
<li>A line number, specified simply as a number.</li>
<li>The name of a marker, specified by the Mark command.</li>
<li>A range between two selection expressions, separated by a colon (:).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The above expressions require no special delimiters (they're not directional like<br>
regular expressions). Regular expressions are actually a kind of selection expression<br>
and are delimited by slash or backslash characters as usual.
</p>
<p>
Some character-skipping variants of these options are also provided, such as the<br>
position that's one character after the selection, denoted by following a selection<br>
expression with an uppercase delta ([[Delta]], Option-J). These are useful in dealing<br>
with context; for instance, you may want to select a string when it's followed by<br>
another character, but not include the following character in the selection. (An<br>
example is given later in the Subword script.) Text emitted by a program like a table<br>
generator may be in a known format, such as a columnar arrangement, in which case<br>
skipping a certain number of characters will take you to the selection you need.
</p>
<p>
Again, the MPW Shell will give you a terse summary of selection expressions when<br>
you execute the command line "Help Selections". I'm not going to list all the minor<br>
variants here, but feel free to while away the hours in rapturous contemplation of<br>
their mysteries on your own.
</p>
<h1>EDITING COMMANDS</h1>
<p>
The most common editing commands are two that you probably use already: Find and<br>
Replace. Dialogs that stand in for these commands are built into the MPW Shell and<br>
accessible from the Find menu. You can give any selection expression as a search<br>
pattern in either of these dialogs by clicking the Selection Expression radio button<br>
instead of the default Literal button. The same commands are the basis of most editing<br>
scripts. As tools, Find and Replace take a selection expression as their primary<br>
argument. Don't confuse Find and Search! The Search command puts out its results as<br>
text, while Find actually changes the selection. In addition, Search takes a pattern --<br>
that is, a regular expression -- while Find takes any selection expression. For<br>
example, to go to the start of a file in a script, you could give the command "Find<b>*</b>",<br>
but not "Search <b>*</b>".
</p>
<p>
Find is the basic navigation command in most editing scripts. For instance, you can<br>
simulate the Select All command in the Edit menu like so:
</p>
<pre>Find *:[[infinity]]  # select from start to end of target</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The commands File and Open, along with the variables Target and Active, determine the<br>
files your scripts will work on. "File" is actually an alias for the real command name,<br>
Target. The File command opens a file and makes it the target window -- the window<br>
behind the frontmost window. The target window is an important notion in MPW. It<br>
exists so that you can use the Worksheet window to type commands that affect another<br>
window; since the Worksheet would be in front, the window being affected would need<br>
to be behind the Worksheet. During scripting, you may prefer to use the Open<br>
command, which opens a file and makes it the frontmost window. The target window is<br>
referred to as {Target} in scripts, while the frontmost window is called {Active}.<br>
Editing commands work on the target window if you don't specify a window explicitly.
</p>
<p>
The Line command may also be used for navigation: it selects the numbered line in the<br>
target window and then brings that window to the front. You probably know this<br>
command already if you use compilers in the MPW Shell, since they put out error<br>
messages in this form:
</p>
<pre>File "gwork.c"; Line 418 # Syntax error</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Executing this command takes you to the line in your code where the error was<br>
detected.
</p>
<p>
The Position command returns the current position in the target window, as a line<br>
number, a character range, or both. The position could be saved to a variable for later<br>
use as follows, using the backquote mechanism to execute a command and insert its<br>
output inline:
</p>
<pre>Set SavedLineNumber `Position -l`</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
There are dozens of commands pertaining to text editing in the MPW scripting<br>
language. Help on all of them is available in the MPW Shell. The usual Macintosh<br>
text-editing menu commands are available in the MPW scripting language, including<br>
New, Open, Close, Save, Revert, Print, and the standard Edit menu commands.
</p>
<p>
StreamEdit is a standalone editing tool that's rich and strange enough to deserve its own<br>
co--&gt;umn. It's a structured search and replacement language based on the UNIXreg.<br>
command sed.
</p>
<p>
Some simpler standalone editing tools are provided. Sort has a rich function set and can<br>
be used for many text-editing tasks. Canon takes a file of search and replace strings<br>
and applies them to a file. It's used to automate terminology changes, such as the work<br>
that was done to make the Mac OS API use fewer acronyms and abbreviations when the<br>
new Inside Macintosh books were written. Translate, like the UNIX command tr, maps<br>
characters onto other characters.
</p>
<p>
Text indentation can be handled with four tools: Adjust, Align, Entab, and Format.<br>
Adjust shifts a line to the right or left by a specified number of spaces. Align sets the<br>
margin of a range of selected lines to the margin of the first selected line. Entab<br>
converts runs of spaces to tabs, and Format sets the column width used for tabs in a<br>
text document, as well as other settings like font and size. (These settings are saved in<br>
a resource in the file, which many ASCII text editors can recognize.)
</p>
<p>
Text-editing scripts often create temporary files, split single files into multiple files,<br>
and perform other file-related tasks. MPW provides commands to help you manage<br>
files. It has commands corresponding to almost all Finder operations, such as<br>
Duplicate, Move, Delete, and NewFolder. There are also some specialized file<br>
commands: FileDiv splits a file into multiple files based on a byte or line count or on<br>
embedded form feed characters inserted during a previous editing pass; Catenate does<br>
the opposite, joining files together.
</p>
<p>
A text-editing script often takes search and substitution text as parameters on the<br>
command line. A few commands related to parameters are worth a quick mention here.<br>
Echo is handy for concatenating parameters with other text. Quote is similar to Echo<br>
but adds quote marks as needed to preserve the word breaks in its parameters. MPW<br>
scripting requires quotes around any string that is meant to be a single parameter but<br>
contains spaces (which would break the string into multiple parameters). Echo puts<br>
out its arguments in a way that allows them to be broken up, while Quote preserves the<br>
original word breaks by inserting quotes.
</p>
<pre>Echo "Richard Loves Pat"
Richard Loves Pat
Quote "Bill Loves Everyone"
'Bill Loves Everyone'</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h1>AN EXAMPLE SCRIPT</h1>
<p>
Here's a script I've found useful for some years. It's called Subword and it replaces a<br>
word by another string everywhere it occurs in the target window.
</p>
<pre>Set Sep "[~a-zA-Z_0-9]"  # word separators
Find * "{Target}"  # start at top of file
Replace -c [[infinity]] [[partialdiff]]
   "[[Delta]]/{Sep}{1}{Sep}/!1:[[Delta]]/{Sep}/" [[partialdiff]]
   "{2}" "{Target}"</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The selection in this Replace command is probably about as clear as the U.S. tax code,<br>
so allow me to explain. The [[Delta]] means one character before the selection. The !1<br>
means one character past the selection. The colon denotes everything between the<br>
selections (inclusively). So this pattern says, in a nutshell, select the pattern in the<br>
first parameter ({1}) when it's bracketed by separators, but exclude the separators.
</p>
<p>
Normally I don't use this script directly. I incorporate it into other scripts as a<br>
utility. The bulk of the work of converting between similar languages like Pascal and C<br>
can be done by an editing script, for example. Subword can be used to convert<br>
keywords, as could Canon. I use another script which is essentially Subword without<br>
the separators for changing symbols like equality operators.
</p>
<p>
Scripts to preconvert between Pascal and C can be found on this issue's CD. They don't<br>
generate compiler-ready text, but I've found that they facilitate a manual conversion<br>
at the rate of hundreds of lines per hour, allowing source bases in the thousands of<br>
lines to be accurately translated in a day or three. So the next time you're faced with a<br>
dull text-processing task, look over the tools MPW gives you, and see whether you can<br>
save yourself a few days of tedious manual labor!
