Developers are constantly pursuing two goals that seem to be at cross-purposes:<br>
making applications more powerful and making them easier to use. All too often, power<br>
brings complexity, when in fact power can be used to simplify things for the user.<br>
Assistants can make the powerful features you're building into your applications<br>
easier to access and handle.
</p>
<p>
An assistant offers the user an alternate interface. It focuses on a specific activity that<br>
the average user is likely to want to do and frames the application's functionality to<br>
support that activity. The defining aspect of an assistant is the interview, in which the<br>
user is asked to supply information about preferences and typical activities<br>
accomplished with the application.
</p>
<p>
Although assistants can be implemented under System 7, they'll be able to do more<br>
using Mac OS 8 technologies. In this article, we talk about what Mac OS 8 assistants<br>
are and give some general guidelines for designing an interview. We also provide an<br>
example of how to implement an interview in System 7. Our sample assistant helps<br>
users with the Internet Configuration System (Internet Config), a utility for setting<br>
preferences for Internet applications. Internet Config is described in detail in the<br>
article "Implementing Shared Internet Preferences With Internet Config" in develop<br>
Issue 23. The source code for the Internet Setup Assistant is included on this issue's<br>
CD.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The final name for assistants,</b> which have also been called experts, has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not been decided at the time of this writing. Whichever the final name, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interview-based interaction that forms the basis of assistants will be an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integral part of the Mac OS 8 help system.*
</p>
<h2>INTRODUCING ASSISTANTS</h2>
<p>
An assistant is a small single-purpose application that can do any or all of the<br>
following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>    frame computer-based tasks in terms of real-world activity</li>
<li> hide details from the user by filtering out options that aren't applicable</li>
<li> pull together elements from different parts of the user interface to<br>
support a single activity</li>
<li> manage tasks so that they're executed on demand or when a specific<br>
condition becomes true</li>
<li> help the user provide the information needed by conducting interviews</li>
<li> make reasonable assumptions, based on user context and user activity,<br>
that work for the vast majority of users</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, a resume-formatting assistant would ask the user how formal or casual<br>
the resume should be. It would then make assumptions, hiding such details as typeface<br>
selection and paragraph formatting. An assistant for maintaining a computer would use<br>
task scheduling to check for viruses when it makes sense, optimize the hard disk when<br>
it needs to, and so on.
</p>
<p>
At first glance, assistants might seem to resemble Microsoft's wizards. Currently,<br>
however, there are differences between them. Wizards don't make reasonable<br>
assumptions based on user context and user activity. Instead of filtering out options<br>
that aren't applicable, they present all options. While assistants provide an alternate<br>
interface to an application or set of applications, wizards might be the only user<br>
interface to a task, and they aren't capable of pulling together elements from other<br>
places in the interface. Wizards also can't schedule tasks for later execution.
</p>
<p>
<b>WHEN TO USE ASSISTANTS</b>
</p>
<p>
Assistants are meant to augment and not replace the more direct ways to control your<br>
application. They shouldn't be used to cover up a flawed user interface design, such as<br>
dialog boxes or commands that are too difficult to figure out. Users should always be<br>
able to do directly in the program's primary interface whatever an assistant does for<br>
them indirectly, though it might take more steps to accomplish the task in the primary<br>
interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you determine when a specific area of the user interface needs a<br>
redesign and when it could use an assistant? In general, an assistant is most effective<br>
when it supports an activity that many users want to perform with your application<br>
but that can only be accomplished if the user has a better-than-average familiarity<br>
with your application's feature set and user interface. For example, we developed an<br>
assistant for Internet Config because it takes several steps in different places of the<br>
interface to set up your Internet preferences for the first time.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE INTERVIEW</b>
</p>
<p>
An assistant conducts a brief interview, consisting of a series of simple questions, to<br>
get the information it needs from the user. The interview should be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>    Short. Ask as few questions as possible. To minimize the number of<br>
questions, the assistant should make as many reasonable assumptions as<br>
possible.</li>
<li> Simple. Make the questions easy to answer. If a difficult question needs to<br>
be asked, the interview should provide information that helps the user answer<br>
the question.</li>
<li> Concise. No words should be wasted, even when providing information to<br>
help the user answer a question.</li>
<li> Neutral. The tone should be conversational and friendly, not too familiar<br>
or too cold.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that an interview isn't a dialog box, nor is it a dialog box taken apart and<br>
presented in a series of smaller dialog boxes. Adding "Assistant" to the name of a<br>
command that calls up a dialog box doesn't make the dialog box an interview or the<br>
command an assistant. Finally, the interview isn't a way to give the computer a<br>
personality.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE INTERVIEW WINDOW</b>
</p>
<p>
The assistant interview takes place in a fixed-size, movable window. Whether it's a<br>
regular (document) window, a modal window, or a floating window depends on the<br>
context from which you anticipate it being invoked. Assistants should be accessible<br>
from appropriate places in your user interface, such as through a menu item or a<br>
button in a dialog box. They should be accessible by name (so that the name of the menu<br>
item or button is the name of the assistant) or, if the context is clear, by the words<br>
"Assist Me." The interview window contains header, content, and navigation areas, as<br>
you can see in Figure 1.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1. </b>A typical assistant interview window
</p>
<ul>
<li>    If the interview window is a document window, the assistant's name<br>
appears in the title bar and the header area displays the interview phase that<br>
the user is in. If it's not a document window, the header area displays the<br>
assistant's name followed by a colon and the interview phase.</li>
<li> The content area contains text (usually a question and a brief<br>
explanation) and editable text fields and other controls that are used to answer<br>
questions and enter information.</li>
<li> The navigation area contains buttons that help the user move through the<br>
interview, such as left and right arrow buttons, which lead to the previous or<br>
next panel, and a Go Back button that takes the user back to the context from<br>
which the assistant was opened. A number between the left and right arrow<br>
buttons indicates how many panels the user has been through (see Figure 1).</li>
</ul>
<h2>DESIGNING AN ASSISTANT FOR INTERNET CONFIG</h2>
<p>
To demonstrate how to add an assistant to your application, the rest of this article<br>
describes how we designed and implemented an assistant for Internet Config, a popular<br>
shareware utility program.
</p>
<p>
With Internet Config, the user can create a single file that stores preferences and<br>
settings for all Internet services. As long as an e-mail program, Web browser, or<br>
other Internet application uses the Internet Config preferences file, the user doesn't<br>
have to reenter Internet preferences for each program.
</p>
<p>
Internet Config's central location for user interaction is the window shown in Figure<br>
2. Clicking each button in the main window brings up a window in which the user<br>
enters information and sets preferences.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/236.gif" width="408 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2.</b> Internet Config's main window
</p>
<p>
Internet Config enables users to store a broad range of preferences, from e-mail<br>
addresses to file conversion formats. Most users never need to set many of these<br>
preferences, but the dedicated Internet habitue probably finds them all useful.<br>
Internet Config risks being overwhelming for the sake of completeness -- a perfect<br>
opportunity for an assistant. Our assistant makes Internet Config easier to use by<br>
helping the user create a preferences file that stores only the preferences that are<br>
most commonly set.
</p>
<p>
<b>DECIDING WHAT THE ASSISTANT WILL DO</b>
</p>
<p>
In designing an assistant, you need to determine what most of your users will want to<br>
do. In the case of Internet Config, recent market studies show that most people use the<br>
Internet for e-mail, browsing, and downloading files. Given that information, the<br>
Internet Config assistant's functionality should be limited to setting preferences in<br>
those areas. The power-surfer minority that wants, for example, to change the default<br>
text editor can still do so directly through Internet Config's interface.
</p>
<p>
Assistants should be made available from wherever they make sense. For the Internet<br>
Setup Assistant, it would be helpful to add an Assist Me button to the main Internet<br>
Config window and an Internet Setup Assistant command to the Help menu. Application<br>
programs that use Internet Config could have a similar button in logical places in their<br>
user interfaces. In addition, the Internet Setup Assistant could be automatically<br>
displayed the first time the user launches Internet Config.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE INTERNET CONFIG INTERVIEW</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Our interview will elicit the information we need in order to store a<br>
simplified set of preferences for the user. As shown in Figure 3, the interview<br>
begins with an introduction that tells the user in plain language the type of<br>
questions that will be asked and describes what the assistant will do (or not<br>
do) based on the user's answers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img src="img/237.gif" width="438 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3. </b>The Internet Setup Assistant introduction
</p>
<p>
The next panel, titled "Personal Information," was shown earlier in Figure 1. This<br>
panel poses two questions that are easy to answer: it asks for the user's name (filling<br>
in a default supplied by the file sharing setup) and company or organization. This<br>
starts the interview off smoothly while still obtaining necessary information.
</p>
<p>
The remaining interview panels that ask questions are listed below (in the order they<br>
appear) and are shown in Figure 4. Note that for a few of the questions, the assistant<br>
provides some information because the questions might be too difficult for some users<br>
to answer. The goal is to keep the interview self-contained, so that the user doesn't<br>
need to go to Apple Guide or a manual to figure out what to do.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/238.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 4.</b> Internet Setup Assistant interview questions
</p>
<ul>
<li>    Geographic Location -- This panel asks a question that doesn't directly<br>
relate to what the assistant does for the user. Many users might be confused if<br>
asked to select an FTP server; instead, the interview asks for the user's<br>
location and then the assistant uses the answer to make a reasonable guess as to<br>
what the user's default FTP servers are.</li>
<li> E-mail Address and Password -- The password appears as bullets when<br>
typed and is encrypted.</li>
<li> E-mail Account and Host Computer</li>
<li> Signature -- This panel asks for a "signature" to be appended to the<br>
user's e-mail messages. A line of hyphens is supplied as the default.</li>
<li> World Wide Web Home Page -- In Internet Config, setting the Web home<br>
page preference takes place in the Other Services window, listed among less<br>
commonly used preferences such as the WAIS gateway and the Whois host.<br>
Many users might be stumped by these options and not find what they're<br>
looking for. Since we've determined that most users are interested in setting<br>
their Web site, the interview covers setting this preference. The default Web<br>
site entered is taken from the Web browser program.</li>
<li> Newsgroup Host Computer</li>
</ul>
<p>
When a user types an answer that's clearly wrong (such as an e-mail address that<br>
doesn't include the @ character), we recommend that you integrate the error trapping<br>
into the flow of the interview questions, rather than presenting an alert box. For<br>
example, when the user clicks the right arrow button and there are invalid values in<br>
the current panel, the next panel should point out the error and restate the question.<br>
The goal is to preserve the question-and-answer, conversational characteristics of the<br>
interview.
</p>
<p>
Finally, when the assistant has asked all the questions, it presents the conclusion panel<br>
(Figure 5). The user can see more details by clicking the Show Details button (which<br>
then changes to Hide Details); the assistant shows the information it will use in<br>
creating the Internet preferences file (name, organization, e-mail address, and so<br>
on), summarizing the user's interview responses.

That's it: ten questions in seven panels, plus an introduction and a conclusion.
</p>
<h2>IMPLEMENTING THE INTERVIEW</h2>
<p>
You can use your favorite application framework to develop an assistant, or write it<br>
from scratch as a small application. On this issue's CD, we provide sample code for<br>
developing an assistant. We don't recommend using Apple Guide to conduct the<br>
interviews. Assistants and Apple Guide are different components of the help system;<br>
they should look related but still different from each other. Also, Apple Guide is a<br>
less-than-efficient tool for implementing assistant interviews. The programming<br>
techniques used in this example are specific to System 7 but will continue to work<br>
under Mac OS 8. As long as you avoid using undocumented features or directly accessing<br>
data structures that have an accessor routine, your code should work fine under Mac<br>
OS 8. In addition, if you insulate your code from specifics of the Macintosh Toolbox, it<br>
will be easier to add Mac OS 8 features later on. For some details about Mac OS 8<br>
compatibility, see the article "Planning for Mac OS 8 Compatibility" in develop Issue<br>
26.
</p>
<p>
Our assistant is based on a simple framework that provides a lightweight<br>
object-oriented coating on top of the Macinosh Toolbox. For example, we have classes<br>
that provide an object-oriented layer on top of Point (CPoint), Rect (CRect),<br>
WindowPtr (CWindow), DialogPtr (CDialog), and so on. We also have a simple<br>
application shell, TApplication. Those files are grouped in the framework folder.
</p>
<p>
The classes aren't dependent on each other, so you can use them easily in your existing<br>
application. You can create an assistant dialog by using an object of a TAssistant<br>
subclass and sending it the appropriate events. Your usual framework can still be used<br>
for handling your event loop and your application's windows. To implement the<br>
appearance of assistants using your own framework, check out the TAssistant class to<br>
see how we've done it.
</p>
<p>
The interview is presented in a dialog by a TAssistant object. The class TAssistant is a<br>
subclass of CMultiDialog, which allows you to have subdialogs that can be switched in<br>
and out as needed. You could use a similar technique to switch among multiple panels in<br>
a preferences dialog. Our implementation uses the ShortenDITL and AppendDITL<br>
routines, as shown in Listing 1. For another way to change panels, see the article<br>
"Multipane Dialogs" in <i>develop</i> Issue 23.

   if (GetSubDialog() != subDialogID) {
      // Save parameters in current panel.
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; kDialogParametersCount; i++) {
         if (fParameters[i].dialogItem != 0)
            GetItemText(fParameters[i].dialogItem,
                fParameters[i].value);
      }

      // Remove items from current dialog.
      if (fSubDialogID &gt; 0)
         ShortenDITL(GetDialogRef(),
                     CountDITL(GetDialogRef()) - fCommonItems);
     
      fSubDialogID = subDialogID;

      {
         // Add new dialog items to the dialog.
         Handle items = GetResource('DITL', GetSubDialog());
         assert(items != NULL);
         AppendDITL(GetDialogRef(), items, overlayDITL);
         ReleaseResource(items);
      }

      // Prepare the items in the dialog.
      DoPrepareDialog();
   }
}</pre>

</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When dialogs are displayed in assistants, you often need to capture the information the<br>
user enters so that you can put it back if the user goes back to that panel. You need to<br>
be able to do this until the user clicks the Go Ahead button in the last panel. To simplify<br>
this task, we substitute a key string, which is stored in the DITL of the dialog, for a<br>
string that can change dynamically. The substitution is done each time the dialog is<br>
displayed. Listing 2 shows how to substitute parameters in the dialog by replacing any<br>
instance of a key that appears in a static or editable text dialog item with a<br>
corresponding value. In addition, if an editable text item contains only a key, the value<br>
entered in the dialog will be associated with the key. This is an extended version of the<br>
^0 parameter substitution done by the Dialog Manager.

<p>
When the assistant starts up, we try to capture as much information as possible about<br>
the user's environment. For example, we use Internet Config information that the user<br>
has previously entered.
</p>
<p>
When the user has entered all the information we ask for and clicked the Go Ahead<br>
button, we again use Internet Config, this time to set the user's preferences. The<br>
CInternetConfig class provides a C++ wrapper to the Internet Config API. See the<br>
details in the source code.
</p>
<h2>THE POWER OF ASSISTANCE</h2>
<p>
As you can see, the Internet Setup Assistant doesn't try to do everything for all users.<br>
Instead, it helps complete tasks in a way that a majority of users will find useful and<br>
valuable.
</p>
<p>
This sample assistant, though a relatively unambitious demonstration, should start<br>
you thinking about how to design and develop assistants for your own applications.<br>
Nothing is quite as powerful as simplicity.
