<i style="font-size:125%;">available on the PowerPC platform and write an equivalent library</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">for the 680x0 Macintosh. This article presents just such a library.</i>
</p>
<p>
Developers of PowerPC applications that need 64-bit math can simply call the various<br>
"wide" Toolbox routines. These routines perform addition, subtraction, multiplication,<br>
division, square root, and a few other operations. On the 680x0-based Macintosh,<br>
some of these same routines are available in QuickDraw GX. But if you can't assume<br>
your customers have QuickDraw GX installed, you need a library that supports 64-bit<br>
math.
</p>
<p>
The Wide library presented in this article works on both platforms and has exactly the<br>
same interface and types as the wide routines in the Toolbox on PowerPC machines. The<br>
library also provides some new routines such as 32-bit to 64-bit add and subtract<br>
and a 64-bit-to-string conversion function. The library is included on this issue's<br>
CD, along with its source code.
</p>
<p>
All the routines use the 64-bit data type defined in the header file Types.h, which is<br>
the standard type used for signed 64-bit integers on both the PowerPC and 680x0<br>
Macintosh:
</p>
<pre>struct wide {
   Sint32   hi;   /* upper 32 bits (signed) */
   Uint32   lo;   /* lower 32 bits (unsigned) */
};
typedef struct wide wide, *WidePtr;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>THE WIDE ROUTINES</h2>
<p>
Before plunging into the Wide library, let's see what 64-bit math routines I'll be<br>
talking about. First, I'll introduce those that are available on PowerPC machines, then<br>
those you'll find on a 680x0 Macintosh with QuickDraw GX, and finally the routines in<br>
the Wide library.
</p>
<p>
<b>POWERPC TOOLBOX</b>
</p>
<p>
In the header file FixMath.h, the routines listed in Table 1 are defined for 64-bit math<br>
on the PowerPC platform.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/217.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>680X0 QUICKDRAW GX</b>
</p>
<p>
On 680x0 machines that have QuickDraw GX installed, all the wide routines for the<br>
PowerPC platform listed in Table 1 are available, with the exception of WideBitShift.<br>
The QuickDraw GX header file GXTypes.h defines the wide routine types and function<br>
prototypes in exactly the same way that the header file FixMath.h does for PowerPC<br>
machines.
</p>
<p>
In addition, QuickDraw GX on 680x0 machines has a routine that the PowerPC<br>
platform doesn't have: WideScale. This function returns the bit number of the<br>
highest-order nonzero bit in a 64-bit number. The Wide library implements this<br>
function on the PowerPC platform.
</p>
<p>
<b>THE WIDE 64-BIT LIBRARY</b>
</p>
<p>
The Wide 64-bit integer math library on this issue's CD provides all the wide<br>
routines that are available on PowerPC machines and on 680x0 machines with<br>
QuickDraw GX, plus a few extras. The extra routines, which are available on both the<br>
PowerPC and 680x0 platforms, are listed in Table 2.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/218.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>WideAssign32, WideAdd32, WideSubtract32. </b>These routines are<br>
self-explanatory.
</p>
<p>
<b>WideToDecStr.</b>This routine converts a signed 64-bit integer to the SANE string type<br>
decimal, which is also defined by the PowerPC Numerics library. This string<br>
structure is a good intermediate format for final conversion to a string format of your<br>
choosing.
</p>
<p>
Since WideToDecStr calls the SANE library to generate the string, SANE must be linked<br>
with your 680x0 application. The SANE library is included with all the major<br>
development systems.
</p>
<p>
To convert the string returned by WideToDecStr to a Pascal string, call the SANE<br>
routine <b>dec2str.</b>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>If you want to generate a localized number,</b> take a look at the article<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"International Number Formatting" in develop Issue 16. You could call the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LocalizeNumberString function from that article after converting the output<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of WideToDecStr to a Pascal string, or you could modify LocalizeNumberString<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to accept the output of WideToDecStr.*
</p>
<p>
<b>WideInit.</b>The library is self-initializing; the first time you call any wide routine,<br>
WideInit is also called. If the execution speed of your first runtime call to a wide<br>
routine is important, you have the option of calling WideInit during your application's<br>
startup to avoid that overhead.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of WideInit is to determine what processor is being used, or emulated; it<br>
calls Gestalt to make this determination. If your Macintosh has a 68020-68040 CPU<br>
(68020, 68030, or 68040), the library will use the 64-bit multiply and divide<br>
instructions available on that processor; otherwise, the library will have to call<br>
software subroutines for those operations. On 68000 machines, such as the Macintosh<br>
Plus and SE, the processor's multiply instruction is limited to 32 bits and the library<br>
has no choice but to use the slower algorithmic approach for multiplication and<br>
division.
</p>
<h2>SOURCE CODE ON A PLATTER</h2>
<p>
The library can be compiled on the 680x0 and PowerPC platforms using either the<br>
Metrowerks CodeWarrior or Symantec C development system. The library tests which<br>
development system is compiling it and, if it's not CodeWarrior or Symantec, the<br>
preprocessor displays an error message saying the library needs to be ported to your<br>
environment. This is necessary because there's some inline assembly language in the<br>
source file, as discussed later in this section, and different C compilers handle<br>
assembly language differently.
</p>
<p>
While the interface routines to our 64-bit library are the same on the PowerPC and<br>
680x0 machines, when you compile the library a different subset of routines is linked<br>
in, depending on your environment:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you build the library for a 680x0 machine without QuickDraw GX<br>
headers, all the Wide library routines are defined.</li>
<li>If you build the library for a 680x0 machine and include the QuickDraw<br>
GX header file GXTypes.h or GXMath.h before the Wide library's Wide.h header<br>
file, the extra routines and the WideBitShift routine are defined. The other<br>
wide routines are already available via the QuickDraw GX traps.</li>
<li>When you compile for the PowerPC platform, only the five extra routines<br>
(WideAssign32, WideAdd32, WideSubtract32, WideToDecStr, and WideInit)<br>
are defined in the library. All the other wide routines already exist in the<br>
PowerPC Toolbox. Additionally, if GXTypes.h or GXMath.h isn't included,<br>
WideScale is defined.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Table 3 summarizes where the wide routines can be found on the different platforms.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/219.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
Note that the Wide library decides at compile time which routines to use. When<br>
QuickDraw GX header files are not included, the Wide library routines are called. If<br>
your application needs to make a runtime decision about whether to use QuickDraw GX,<br>
you'll need to make some changes to the library. One solution is to rename the Wide<br>
library routines and remove the conditional compilation tests for QuickDraw GX from<br>
the source. Then at run time you can decide which version to call -- the QuickDraw GX<br>
routines if they're available, or the internal Wide library routinesif not.
</p>
<p>
<b>UNIVERSAL HEADERS</b>
</p>
<p>
The Wide library was compiled with version 2.1 of Apple's universal headers. The<br>
latest headers are available on this issue's CD. You should make sure you have a recent<br>
version of these headers, because the library uses the constant GENERATING68K. If the<br>
header file ConditionalMacros.h doesn't contain this constant, your version of the<br>
universal headers is too old.
</p>
<p>
<b>680X0 ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE</b>
</p>
<p>
Some of the routines in the library are written in assembly language to take advantage<br>
of the 64-bit multiply and divide instructions on 68020-68040 machines, because<br>
on these machines the C language will use only 32-bit multiply and divide<br>
instructions. On PowerPC machines, the Wide library doesn't need assembly language<br>
because the 64-bit multiply and divide routines are provided by the Toolbox.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The library's source file Wide.c contains both C and assembly language. It has been<br>
successfully compiled by Symantec C 7.0.4 and CodeWarrior 7. If you want to compile<br>
the library on any other development system, you may have to do a little work porting<br>
it. Most of the changes will be confined to the conditional compilation statements at the<br>
beginning of Wide.c where the differences in SANE types and inline assembly language<br>
are handled.
</p>
<h2>A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME WIDE ROUTINES</h2>
<p>
Now let's look at a couple of the more interesting routines in the Wide library to see<br>
how they work. See the source code on the CD for full implementations of all the<br>
routines.
</p>
<p>
<b>WIDEMULTIPLY</b>
</p>
<p>
WideMultiply (Listing 1) performs a 32-by-32-bit multiply and produces a 64-bit<br>
result. The first and second parameters are the two signed 32-bit integers to be<br>
multiplied together. The return value is a pointer to the 64-bit result that's also<br>
returned via the third parameter.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1. </b>The multiply routine
</p>
<pre>wide *WideMultiply (
   long multiplicand,   /* in: first value to multiply */
   long multiplier,      /* in: second value to multiply */
   wide *target_ptr)      /* out: 64 bits to be assigned */
{
   /* Initialize Wide library if not already done. */
   if (!gWide_Initialized) WideInit();

   /* If the 64-bit multiply instruction is available... */
   if (gWide_64instr) {
      /* Execute the assembly-language instruction MULS.L */
      Wide_MulS64(multiplicand, multiplier, target_ptr);
   }
   else {
      /* Call the Toolbox to perform the multiply. */
      LongMul(multiplicand, multiplier, (Int64Bit *) target_ptr);
   }

   return (target_ptr);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
WideMultiply first tests whether the library has been initialized yet; if not, it calls<br>
WideInit. Next the routine tests whether the 64-bit multiply instruction is available<br>
on the current CPU by examining the global variable gWide_64instr (which was set<br>
by the initialization routine WideInit). If the instruction is available, WideMultiply<br>
calls the assembly-language function Wide_MulS64 to take advantage of it (as<br>
described later); otherwise, WideMultiply calls the Toolbox routine LongMul to<br>
perform the multiplication, as would be the case on 68000 machines.
</p>
<p>
<b>WIDESQUAREROOT</b>
</p>
<p>
The WideSquareRoot function (Listing 2) takes a 64-bit unsigned number as input and<br>
returns a 32-bit unsigned result. All possible results can be expressed in 32 bits, so<br>
overflow isn't possible.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 2. </b>The square root routine
</p>
<pre>unsigned long WideSquareRoot (
   const wide *source_ptr) /* in: value to take the square root of */
{
   wide            work_integer;
   Extended_80      extended_80_number;

   /* Initialize Wide library if not already done. */
   if (!gWide_Initialized) WideInit();

   /* Convert "wide" number to "extended" format. */
   Wide_ToExtended(&amp;extended_80_number, source_ptr);

   /* If compiling with CodeWarrior, the parameter to sqrt is a
      pointer instead of a value, as defined in PowerPC Numerics. */
#ifdef __MWERKS__
   Sqrt(&amp;extended_80_number);
#else
   extended_80_number = sqrt(extended_80_number);
#endif

   /* Convert "extended" format to "wide" number. */
   Wide_FromExtended(&amp;work_integer, &amp;extended_80_number);
  
   /* OK to ignore work_integer.hi as it's always 0. */
   return (work_integer.lo);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
For this routine I decided to let the SANE library do the work of generating the square<br>
root. The routine converts the 64-bit input number to an 80-bit floating-point<br>
number and then calls the SANE library function <b>sqrt</b> to calculate the square root.<br>
Finally, WideSquareRoot converts the resulting 80-bit floating-point number back to<br>
a 64-bit integer and returns the low-order half of the result.
</p>
<p>
When a 64-bit integer is converted to an 80-bit floating-point number, no loss in<br>
precision occurs. An 80-bit floating-point number is made up of three parts -- the<br>
sign (1 bit), the exponent (15 bits), and the fractional part (64 bits). As you can<br>
see, a 64-bit integer exactly fits in the fractional part.
</p>
<p>
Two differences between the CodeWarrior and Symantec development systems that<br>
show up in the Wide library's WideSquareRoot function are the 80-bit floating-point<br>
types and the parameters of the SANE library's square root function. Under<br>
CodeWarrior, the Wide library internal type Extended_80 is defined as the type<br>
<b>extended80</b>, and Sqrt returns the result to the same location as the input number.<br>
Under Symantec C, Extended_80 is defined as the type <b>extended</b>, and <b>sqrt</b> returns the<br>
result as a function return value.
</p>
<h2>INTERNAL ASSEMBLY-LANGUAGE ROUTINES</h2>
<p>
The Wide library uses internal assembly-language routines to execute 64-bit<br>
multiply and divide instructions on machines that support those instructions. In case<br>
you're interested, here are the details.
</p>
<p>
Symantec and CodeWarrior handle the <b>asm</b> keyword differently, so I used some<br>
preprocessor commands (#defines) to handle the differences between the two<br>
development systems. Near the beginning of the Wide.c source file there are four<br>
#defines that differ depending on which development system you're using, as shown in<br>
Table 4.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/220.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>WIDE_MULS64</b>
</p>
<p>
Wide_MulS64 (Listing 3) is an internal assembly-language routine that<br>
WideMultiply calls to execute the 64-bit multiply instruction on the 68020-68040<br>
CPUs. It starts with ASM_FUNC_HEAD, as mentioned in Table 4. The three definitions<br>
at the start of the function (MULTIPLICAND, MULTIPLIER, and OUT_PTR) are the byte<br>
offsets to the parameters. Although in Symantec C it's possible to refer to function<br>
parameters by name via A6, this isn't possible in CodeWarrior. I had to give up<br>
accessing the parameters by name and use #defines instead.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 3.</b> 64-bit multiply instruction
</p>
<pre>ASM_FUNC_HEAD static void Wide_MulS64 (
   long multiplicand,   /* in: first value to multiply */
   long multiplier,     /* in: second value to multiply */
   wide *out_ptr)       /* out: 64 bits to be assigned */
{
#define MULTIPLICAND     8
#define MULTIPLIER      12
#define OUT_PTR         16

ASM_BEGIN
      MOVE.L   MULTIPLICAND(A6),D0     //
      DC.W      0x4C2E,0x0C01,0x000C   // MULS.L multiplier(A6),D1-D0
      MOVE.L   OUT_PTR(A6),A0          //
      MOVE.L    D0,WIDE_LO(A0)         //
      MOVE.L   D1,WIDE_HI(A0)          //
ASM_END
ASM_FUNC_TAIL
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To execute the 64-bit multiply instruction I had to define it with a DC.W directive that<br>
generates the desired object code. This was necessary because the Symantec C inline<br>
assembler supports only the 32-bit multiply instruction and won't recognize the<br>
64-bit assembly opcode.
</p>
<p>
<b>WIDE_DIVIDEU</b>
</p>
<p>
If the 64-bit divide instruction isn't available, the library calls the internal<br>
assembly-language routine Wide_DivideU (Listing 4) to perform the division using an<br>
algorithm. The algorithm is basically a binary version of the paper and pencil method<br>
of doing long division that all of us learned in school. It's a loop that executes once for<br>
each bit in the size of the divisor, which is 32 in our case. The Wide_DivideU<br>
subroutine actually handles only unsigned division, but the library function that calls<br>
it will take care of converting the input parameters to positive values and, if required,<br>
converting the result to a negative value.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 4.</b> 64-bit unsigned division algorithm

   wide *dividend_ptr,      /* in/out: 64 bits to be divided */

   long *remainder_ptr)     /* out: the remainder of the division */

}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The top of the assembly-language loop starts at the @divloop label. For each loop, the<br>
algorithm shifts the quotient and the remainder left one bit position before trying to<br>
subtract the divisor from the remainder. If the subtraction can be done, the<br>
least-significant bit in quotient.lo is set; otherwise, the subtraction is undone by the<br>
add instruction near the @div50 label. Then, if the divisor is greater than the loop bits<br>
that are accumulating in register D4, the least-significant bit in quotient.hi is set.
</p>
<p>
Notice that the first assembly-language statement in Wide_DivideU is a MOVEM.L<br>
instruction that saves on the stack all the registers that the division loop uses; the last<br>
instruction is a MOVEM.L instruction that restores these registers. Fortunately, this<br>
subroutine can place all its working variables in registers and avoid the stack for its<br>
loop, thus improving performance.
</p>
<h2>WORLDS APART</h2>
<p>
There you have it. Now 64-bit integer math can be handled with the same API on both<br>
the 680x0 and PowerPC platforms. Having the same function-level interface on these<br>
two very different processors makes life a lot easier for application programmers.<br>
Don't you wish all libraries had the same interface regardless of the CPU or system<br>
software version?
