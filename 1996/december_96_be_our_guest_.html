<p>
Imagine you're working on a program than runs on both Macintosh and Windows<br>
computers. Suppose you aren't the only programmer working on the project, and you<br>
occasionally want to work from home. Seems like a pretty common situation.
</p>
<p>
Soon everyone begins to make their own changes to the program and you realize that<br>
you need some kind of source code control. When people think of source code control,<br>
they often picture a safe database that keeps a history of every change to the project.<br>
Most source control systems do a reasonable job of that. But what surprisingly few<br>
people worry about is the much greater need to merge each programmer's changes into<br>
the common code base. For some reason this is where many popular source code control<br>
systems fall flat; here we'll tell you about one that doesn't.
</p>
<p>
Many systems require that you check out a file before modifying it. This is so that two<br>
people don't modify the same file at the same time. Unfortunately, this makes global<br>
changes difficult. Something as simple as changing a routine name from doQMFX to<br>
PrintFile doesn't get done because you need to check out every file and someone else<br>
already has them checked out; it's just not worth the hassle. In the early stages of<br>
development, when everyone is changing many files at the same time, the<br>
check-in/check-out model can slow you down even more. Some systems let a file be<br>
checked out by several people, who must then merge their changes into a single file.<br>
Even with the best tools, this process of merging often requires you to look at every<br>
individual change, presumably so that you can verify each one. But you typically end<br>
up incorporating every change anyway. Why not save a lot of time and headaches by<br>
automating this process completely?
</p>
<p>
There are other annoying problems with some source code control systems, such as<br>
limited cross-platform support and difficult or impossible access to the database from<br>
home. And with some systems that use a database, you can't do simple things like grep<br>
through your files. These problems can really get in the way of getting your work done.
</p>
<p>
If after reading this far you say, "Yeah, I hate source code control. I wish I just had a<br>
bunch of files and didn't have to think about other people stepping on my files," then<br>
read on. If instead you say, "I don't get what he's talking about. I don't mind checking<br>
files out and back in and merging them by hand," then skip to the next article.
</p>


<h2>OUR SOLUTION</h2>
<p>
Still with us? Great. To avoid these problems, we at Eclectus have developed three<br>
tools based on the GNU diff utility: Merge, Difference, and Undifference. They<br>
accompany this column on this issue's CD and <i>develop</i>'s Web site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's an overview<br>
of how our scheme works:
</p>
<ol>
<li>We put all the files in the project in one directory tree -- named, say,<br>
HotApp-0. We mark all the files read-only and put them on a shared server.</li>
<li>Each programmer makes a copy of HotApp-0 on his or her local machine.<br>
They do all their work in their own local copy, changing any file they want.</li>
<li>When everyone agrees that their changes are ready to merge into a new<br>
version, we use Merge, which automatically incorporates the changes into a<br>
new source tree that we name HotApp-1. When two people modify the same<br>
line, Merge reports a conflict that we must look at and resolve. Surprisingly,<br>
conflicts are rare. After fixing the conflicts by hand, we make any changes<br>
necessary to compile the application; then we mark each file read-only and<br>
put HotApp-1 on the shared server.</li>
<li>All programmers copy HotApp-1 to their local machines and development<br>
continues.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Suppose I want to bring some work home with me. I use Difference to create a<br>
difference script of changes between the current version -- say, HotApp-1 -- and my<br>
local working copy. This difference script is usually small enough to put on a floppy<br>
disk or beam over a modem. At home, where I also have a copy of HotApp-1, I use<br>
Undifference to restore the working copy of my project. I can copy my changes made at<br>
home back to work the same way.
</p>
<p>
If I want a copy of the source for safekeeping, I either copy HotApp-1 from the shared<br>
server or, if I really care about space, I difference HotApp-1 against HotApp-0 and<br>
compress the result, which is tiny.
</p>
<p>
If the machine I'm working on doesn't get backed up automatically every day, I can use<br>
the same method to back up my work. I just difference my working copy against the<br>
most recent shared copy, compress it, and put it in a safe place -- like on a server<br>
that's backed up automatically. Compressed daily difference files are so small that I<br>
can keep a year's worth in only about 20 MB.
</p>
<p>
Because these tools are based on GNU diff, they're free (thanks to the Free Software<br>
Foundation), the source code is available, and they're extraordinarily fast. Using<br>
Difference, Undifference, and Merge is approximately as fast as copying an equivalent<br>
number of files. We can do a complete n-way merge -- a merge between n<br>
programmers -- in less time than it used to take to check out just a few files with<br>
competitive alternatives. We can difference or undifference our project (about 4 MB<br>
of source) in less than one minute on a low-end Power Macintosh or a Windows NT<br>
computer, and merge two trees in less than two minutes.
</p>
<p>
Because the source is freely available, you can easily tweak the tools to add your<br>
favorite features. Of course you'll have to share those features with everyone else, but<br>
that just makes the tools better.
</p>


<h2>A REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>
At Eclectus, our current project is a program that runs on both the Mac OS and<br>
Windows platforms, each developed at a different location. Let's say Alan and John are<br>
each modifying their own copy of HotApp-0.
</p>
<ol>
<li>When they decide it's time to merge their changes, Alan beams John his<br>
diffs against HotApp-0 via e-mail.</li>
<li>John uses Undifference on Alan's diffs to reconstruct Alan's source code<br>
tree. Now both John's source and Alan's source are on John's machine.</li>
<li>John merges Alan's source code with his own to create a new version,<br>
naming it HotApp-1, and makes any changes necessary to compile HotApp-1 on<br>
Windows.</li>
<li>John uses Difference on HotApp-1 against HotApp-0 and beams these diffs<br>
to Alan via e-mail.</li>
<li>Alan undifferences these diffs against HotApp-0 to construct HotApp-1,<br>
the same new version John now has. Alan might have to make some changes to<br>
get HotApp-1 to compile on the Macintosh because of John's recent changes<br>
that were automatically merged -- for example, John might have forgotten to<br>
ifdef a Windows-specific piece of code. These changes will show up after the<br>
next merge of HotApp.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Development continues, and we repeat this process whenever we feel it's time to merge<br>
again. We usually use a modem or e-mail to exchange the diffs, since they're small.
</p>
<p>
This process generalizes to more than two programmers since the merge utility will<br>
handle any number of modified versions. Deciding when to merge is up to all the<br>
programmers. We usually merge when somebody wants to make their changes<br>
available to everyone else and nobody has totally broken their version. Sometimes<br>
months pass between merges, sometimes we merge twice a day. Near the end of a<br>
development cycle we like to merge at least once a day so that a recent copy is always<br>
available for testing.
</p>


<h2>DETAILS</h2>
<p>
Automatic merging, tiny diffs files, no time-consuming file checkout? Sounds great,<br>
but there are a lot of details you're probably wondering about.
</p>
<p>
<b>What do the merges look like?</b>
</p>
<p>
To merge changes, we use a command-line environment (MPW, ToolServer, and so<br>
on). In the above example, we would use the following Macintosh command to merge<br>
changes:
</p>
<pre>merge :HotApp-0 :HotApp-John :HotApp-Alan :HotApp-1</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In this example, HotApp-0 is a directory tree containing the original code that both<br>
John and Alan started with. HotApp-John is a directory tree containing John's version<br>
after his changes, and HotApp-Alan contains Alan's version. HotApp-1 will contain the<br>
result of the merge when the command is finished. If we had more programmers, we'd<br>
just include their directories after Alan's. (With several programmers, you might<br>
think that the time involved in sending complete source trees back and forth would be<br>
prohibitive, but remember that the only thing that needs to be sent is a small diffs<br>
file, and then the source tree can be rebuilt quickly and locally.)
</p>
<p>
When conflicts occur in the merge, the conflicting files are renamed by prefixing an<br>
exclamation point (!) to the filename, and the conflicting lines of code are marked in<br>
the merged file. Usually conflicts are solved by editing the merged file and taking one<br>
person's changes. After conflicts are resolved, you rename the file back to its original<br>
name.
</p>
<p>
<b>Are automatic merges really safe?</b>
</p>
<p>
Many programmers are suspicious of automatic merges. What if Joe makes a change<br>
that's incompatible with Helen's, but they don't change the same line? Merge doesn't<br>
identify this snafu. To avoid or identify bugs caused by incompatible changes, Joe and<br>
Helen must talk to each other or look at all their changes. If you're so inclined, you can<br>
give Merge an option that will list all the changes everyone has made so that you can<br>
review them individually. Even so, after seeing automatic merges being used for over<br>
10 years in lots of different projects with lots of programmers, we've found that the<br>
time saved and the elimination of human error from manual merges more than<br>
compensates for rare cases of incompatible changes. Of course, as you near the<br>
shipping date, it makes sense to have every change to the project carefully<br>
code-reviewed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Can I rename a file?</b>
</p>
<p>
Yes, as long as you do it right after a merge, when there's only a single copy of the<br>
source tree; otherwise Merge treats renamed files as new and they won't get properly<br>
merged with the previous source. But since Merge identifies files that were added or<br>
deleted from each person's source tree, it's easy to detect these situations.
</p>
<p>
<b>What happens to junk files?</b>
</p>
<p>
Imagine you created some temporary file named Junk. Merge lists this file as a newly<br>
created file found in your source tree. If you like, these tools can also ignore certain<br>
files based on their filename extension. We like to put all our derived files, like object<br>
files, in a subdirectory named Derived.i and have Merge, Difference, and Undifference<br>
ignore files and directories that end in ".i". Just edit a table in the source code to define<br>
which extensions you want to ignore.
</p>
<p>
<b>What happens if I rearrange a lot of code?</b>
</p>
<p>
If two or more people modify the same routine and one of them moves the routine to a<br>
new place, Merge won't be able to merge the changes automatically. This case is treated<br>
the same as if two or more people modified the same line: you have to look at the<br>
changes and sort them out by hand. We often delay rearranging a lot of code until after<br>
a merge, but before we distribute the merged version.
</p>
<p>
<b>How do you pick up someone's bug fix?</b>
</p>
<p>
If someone has a fix to a bug that they're not ready to merge, but it's holding up your<br>
work, you can just copy their code containing the fix and put it in your project. Merge<br>
doesn't treat this as a conflict even though more than one person changed the code,<br>
because their changes were identical.
</p>
<p>
<b>What about binary files?</b>
</p>
<p>
Merge automatically handles one person changing a binary file, but not more than one.<br>
In the latter case you must merge by hand. For this reason, we try to keep as much of<br>
our project as possible in text rather than binary files.
</p>
<p>
<b>Does this really work with more than two programmers?</b>
</p>
<p>
T/Maker successfully used our tools for a number of years while developing WriteNow<br>
For Macintosh with five programmers. Various companies with many programmers<br>
working on multiple projects have been using successive automatic two-way merges<br>
for years.
</p>
<p>
<b>What about cross-platform support?</b>
</p>
<p>
Merge, Difference, and Undifference are written in C and currently run on the Mac OS<br>
(MPW with CodeWarrior 10 tools and libraries), Windows NT or 95 (Microsoft<br>
Visual C++ 4.0), and NeXT (GNU C). If you need to support a new platform, these tools<br>
should be easy to port as long as your platform has an ANSI C compiler. Some special<br>
issues arise when working on cross-platform projects. Let's suppose I have all the<br>
code for a Macintosh project and I want to move it to Windows NT or 95.
</p>
<ol>
<li>I difference my source code tree against an empty directory on the<br>
Macintosh, resulting in a text file that I move to Windows.</li>
<li>Windows uses different end-of-line characters, so I run a little utility,<br>
MacToWin, to change the end-of-line characters. Going in the opposite<br>
direction, CodeWarrior IDE and BBEdit on Macintosh can automatically change<br>
end-of-line characters.</li>
<li>I undifference against an empty directory on Windows and my files are<br>
reconstructed. Even binary files are transferred correctly.</li>
<li>Finally, I name the directory containing the code HotApp-0 on both<br>
Windows and Macintosh.</li>
</ol>
<p>
We continue to develop as before, except we each have a separate copy of HotApp-0 on<br>
our respective platforms, rather than a shared copy on a single server. If I were to<br>
share a single server from both platforms, I would have two separate directory trees,<br>
one for each platform, each with the correct end-of-line characters. This would let<br>
you use tools like grep in each platform to search through the files in the project.<br>
When you need to synchronize the two source trees, you'll convert one of them to the<br>
other platform for the merge.
</p>
<p>
If you work on two different platforms at the same time, you could make a separate<br>
copy on each platform and treat each one as if it were owned by a different<br>
programmer.
</p>
<p>
Better yet, if you use CodeWarrior or BBEdit for editing on the Macintosh, the<br>
end-of-line problem goes away completely and you can keep just one source tree for<br>
both platforms.
</p>
<p>
<b>What do you do with resource forks on a Macintosh?</b>
</p>
<p>
When you use Undifference and Merge on a Macintosh, they take the resource fork for<br>
the new file from the original directory tree -- that is, HotApp-0 in the above<br>
example. This means that after a merge, any changes you made to the resource fork<br>
since the last merge must be made by hand. However, once it's in a directory tree that<br>
everyone copies -- HotApp-1 in the example -- the resource fork will automatically<br>
be propagated to new versions by Undifference and Merge. When you use Undifference<br>
and Merge on other platforms to incorporate changes from a Macintosh, resource forks<br>
are ignored. This means that you need to store any resources that you regularly edit in<br>
a text file and use a resource compiler like Rez.
</p>
<p>
<b>What about changes to date and time?</b>
</p>
<p>
Undifference preserves the date and time of a file in a new modified directory tree<br>
when there were no changes to the file. This means that you can iterate through many<br>
merge cycles and files that weren't changed will still have the same dates and times.
</p>
<p>
<b>What about non-ASCII characters?</b>
</p>
<p>
The Mac OS, Windows, and UNIXreg. platforms differ in their interpretation of<br>
characters outside the 7-bit ASCII range. These characters are usually not a problem<br>
when they're in a file used on only one platform. However, when one of these<br>
characters occurs in a file used on more than one platform, it's often a bug. Difference<br>
and Undifference identify files that contain non-ASCII characters to help detect this<br>
potential problem.
</p>
<p>
<b>What about long filenames?</b>
</p>
<p>
When developing on more than one platform, you're limited to the lowest common<br>
denominator filename length and path length, since the same file must have the same<br>
name on all platforms.
</p>
<p>
<b>What about change comments?</b>
</p>
<p>
The tools don't require you to add change comments. If you want them, you must<br>
manually add them when you edit your code.
</p>
<p>
<b>What is the Free Software Foundation?</b>
</p>
<p>
These tools exist because of the Free Software Foundation. They provide the source code<br>
to many useful programs, including the GNU utilities upon which these tools were<br>
based. (GNU is short for "GNU's Not UNIX.") Note that any modifications to their code<br>
must be made freely available under the same terms. You can contact them via e-mail<br>
at gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.
</p>


<h2>BEGGING TO DIFFER</h2>
<p>
These tools grew out of our frustration with existing source code control systems.<br>
After using them for many years, we've found them to be indispensable to our<br>
development. They've served us well because they're simple, fast, and easy to adapt to<br>
new situations. We hope that you'll enjoy using them as much as we do -- and if you<br>
don't, perhaps you'll improve them.
