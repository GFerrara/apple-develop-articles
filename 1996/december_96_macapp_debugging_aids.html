<i style="font-size:125%;">debugging aids for more trouble-free MacApp programming.</i>
</p>
<p>
In the article "Displaying Hierarchical Lists" in <i>develop</i> Issue 18, Martin Minow<br>
suggests that MacApp offers "flexible libraries for displaying and managing structured<br>
data." I accepted his challenge and decided to create a Twist Down Lists application with<br>
MacApp version 3.3.1. As complete as MacApp is, you still have to test your<br>
application to make sure it works. Among the problems I encountered, perhaps none<br>
were more frustrating than the insidious memory leak and the dreaded access fault.<br>
After discovering the <i>n</i>th memory leak and the <i>m</i>th access fault in my Twist Down Lists<br>
application, I decided that the situation was unacceptable -- there had to be a better<br>
way!
</p>
<p>
To solve these problems, I developed several debugging techniques. These techniques<br>
were useful to me, so I decided to share them with you in this article. Here are some of<br>
them:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Object counting</i> lets you quickly discover memory leaks.</li>
<li><i>Memory display</i> helps you gauge the size of a memory leak.</li>
<li><i>Object display</i> helps you identify the cause of a memory leak and an access<br>
fault.</li>
<li><i>Object heap discipline</i> helps your application manage tight memory<br>
situations by allowing you to erect a barrier to further expansion of the object<br>
heap.</li>
<li><i>Failure handling</i> lets you force a failure in any spot in your code.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Accompanying this article on this issue's CD and <i>develop</i>'s Web siteis the complete<br>
Twist Down Lists application, which you can look at to see the implementation of all<br>
the debugging aids described in this article. Also provided are two engineering notes,<br>
"EN1 - Object Counting and Display" and "EN2 - Object Heap Discipline," which go<br>
into the gory details of implementing these debugging aids, and copies of the four<br>
MacApp files UObject.h, UObject.cp, PlatformMemory.h, and PlatformMemory.cp,<br>
which I modified to incorporate the debugging aids and which you can substitute for the<br>
original files (or similarly modify them yourself).
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Most of these debugging techniques</b> are specifically for MacApp version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3.1. Later versions may already incorporate similar debugging features.*
</p>


<h2>OBJECT COUNTING</h2>
<p>
I've found object counting to be the fastest way to discover memory leaks. To maintain<br>
a running count of the number of objects in existence, I use a global variable named<br>
gObjectCount. Whenever a TObject is created or cloned, gObjectCount is incremented;<br>
when a TObject is destroyed, gObjectCount is decremented. The variable is incremented<br>
in the TObject constructor or TObject::ShallowClone and is decremented in the TObject<br>
destructor. To print the current value of gObjectCount, I use a global function named<br>
PrintObjectCount. You can call this function at any point in the application where you<br>
think it's useful. In my experience, one of the best places to test the value of<br>
gObjectCount is at the beginning of the function TYourApplication::DoSetupMenus. That<br>
point represents a set of stable application states that you should always be able to<br>
return to. By monitoring the value of gObjectCount as the application runs, you can<br>
obtain a set of characteristic values for gObjectCount. Any variation in these values<br>
should be investigated as a possible memory leak.
</p>
<p>
For example, for Twist Down Lists, the object count just after startup is 49. After a<br>
twistDownDocument is opened and closed, this count increases to 52. This increase is a<br>
consequence of adding a print handler to the view; a TPrintInfo and two TDependencies<br>
objects are created but never freed. Then, if you change the font size by choosing the<br>
Other menu item, the object count increases to 55. In this case, the TDialogTEView,<br>
TAdornerList, and TScroller objects are created when a new font size is entered in the<br>
TNumberText; they're never freed. Thereafter, the quiescent value of gObjectCount<br>
remains unchanged.
</p>
<p>
By using object counting, I've discovered TObject-based memory leaks in just<br>
minutes. To implement it, you need to make changes to UObject.h and UObject.cp, as<br>
described in "EN1 - Object Counting and Display." Or you can include the substitute<br>
UObject.h and UObject.cp files that I've provided.
</p>


<h2>MEMORY DISPLAY</h2>
<p>
My global function DisplayMemoryInfo displays the amount of free memory, the size of<br>
the temporary reserve, the size of the permanent reserve, the object heap size, the<br>
amount of memory available in the object heap, and the amount of object heap space<br>
used. If you have a memory leak, this function can give you information about the size<br>
of the leak. As with object counting, you can get a set of characteristic values as you<br>
run the application. The most useful of these indicators is the amount of object heap<br>
space used. In my experience, it makes the most sense to call this function at the<br>
beginning of the function TYourApplication::DoSetupMenus when you also display the<br>
object count. Realize that each time the object heap is expanded, an overhead of 20<br>
bytes is incurred. As a result, the amount of object heap space slowly increases until<br>
the object heap reaches its maximum size. So if you see the amount of space used in the<br>
object heap increasing by some multiple of 20, it might just be attributable to object<br>
heap overhead. 
</p>
<p>
To implement memory display, you need to make changes to UObject.h and UObject.cp,<br>
as described in "EN1 - Object Counting and Display." Or you can include the substitute<br>
UObject.h and UObject.cp files that I've provided.
</p>


<h2>OBJECT DISPLAY</h2>
<p>
While object counting and memory display let you quickly discover a memory leak, it's<br>
object display that helps you to identify the cause of the memory leak or an access<br>
fault. Turning on object display means that when a TObject-based object is<br>
constructed, a message -- including "who, what, and where" -- appears in the<br>
debugging window. Likewise, when the object is destroyed, a similar message appears.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>You can use a Simple Input-Output Window (SIOW) </b>instead of your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debugger's log window to display this information if you prefer.*
</p>
<p>
When an object is created, if object display is on, the debugger log window displays a<br>
message similar to the following:
</p>
<pre>Construct TSomeMacAppObject@ 0x2D6ACA4 Id=74 Size=108 ObjCnt = 73
#Construct TMyObject@ 0x2D6ACA4 Id=74 Size=108 ObjCnt = 73</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When the object is destroyed, the log window displays a message like this:
</p>
<pre>#Destruct TMyObject@ 0x2D6ACA4 Id=74 Size=108 ObjCnt = 73
Destruct TSomeMacAppObject@ 0x2D6ACA4 Id=74 Size=108 ObjCnt = 73</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Each line gives the class name of the object, its location in the object heap, its class<br>
ID, its size in bytes, and the current value of gObjectCount. In addition, the message<br>
tells you whether the object was created or destroyed.
</p>
<p>
So why are there two lines for construction and destruction? When an object like<br>
TMyObject is created, its TObject constructor is executed first, followed by the<br>
constructors for any MacApp objects in the descendant chain, ending with the<br>
constructor for TMyObject. In other words, objects are built from the bottom up. As<br>
each constructor does its thing, it's given the chance to display a message identifying<br>
itself. So when a new object is created, a series of messages is displayed that identify<br>
each stage of the construction process.
</p>
<p>
When the object TMyObject is destroyed, the process is reversed, with the destructor<br>
for TMyObject first displaying a message identifying itself, followed by the<br>
destructors for any MacApp objects in the descendant chain and ending with the<br>
destructor for TObject. Objects are destroyed from the top down.
</p>
<p>
Running an application with object display on provides a wealth of information about<br>
what an application is doing -- information that you can't get any other way. It's also a<br>
<i>great</i> way to find out what MacApp is doing. As described later in the section<br>
"Implementing Object Display," you can use flags to specify how much information to<br>
display.
</p>
<p>
<b>DETECTING MEMORY LEAKS</b>
</p>
<p>
Of course, when tracking down a memory leak, you're interested in finding an object<br>
that was created but never destroyed. To find this object, it's necessary to match object<br>
destructions with constructions. The leftover construction is the offending object that<br>
wasn't destroyed. You match constructions and destructions by using the addresses<br>
provided in the object display.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Be careful when matching </b>object destructions and constructions, because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MacApp will reuse space in the object heap. I've often seen MacApp make a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAppleEvent, shortly thereafter free it, and then go on to make another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAppleEvent and store it at exactly the same address.*
</p>
<p>
If your debugger allows you to save the contents of the log window, sorting it on the<br>
address field would bunch all items with the same address together. That would make it<br>
much easier to match destructions with constructions. If you assign each object a<br>
serial number in its constructor, it would be even easier to do the matching.
</p>
<p>
Consider a real example. The MacApp example application IconEdit has a memory leak.<br>
(I found the leak because I used the application as a template.) Listing 1 shows the<br>
offending code.
</p>

            if (GetColor(kBestSystemLocation, thePrompt, fColor,
                  newColor)) {
               if (TOSADispatcher::fgDispatcher-&gt;GetDefaultTarget()
                     -&gt;IsRecordingOn()) {
                  TSetPropertyEvent *appleEvent =
                      new TSetPropertyEvent;
                  appleEvent-&gt;ISetPropertyEvent(gServerAddress,

                  appleEvent-&gt;Send();   // &lt;-- the problem
               }
               else {
                  TSetColorCommand *aSetColorCommand =
                                       new TSetColorCommand();
                  aSetColorCommand-&gt;ISetColorCommand(this, newColor);
                  PostCommand(aSetColorCommand);
               }
            }
         }
         break;
      default:
         Inherited::DoMenuCommand(aCommandNumber);
         break;
   }
}</pre>

<p>

</p>
<p>
With object counting and display, it took only minutes to discover the leak and identify<br>
the offending objects. Deciding how to eliminate the leak took a little longer. The leak<br>
arises because TAppleEvent::Send returns a reply TAppleEvent and neither it nor the<br>
TAppleEvent that was sent is freed. This leak is fixed by using the code snippet
</p>
<pre>TAppleEvent * theReply = theEvent-&gt;Send();
FreeIfObject(theEvent);
FreeIfObject(theReply);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
in place of
</p>
<pre>appleEvent-&gt;Send();</pre>
<p>
Listing 1 is an example of a small memory leak, only 64 bytes. Because of its small<br>
size, it's virtually undetectable by means other than object display. These small<br>
memory leaks are a very serious problem because they fragment the object heap.<br>
Suppose that every time a command is executed, a 64-byte memory leak is created and<br>
they're uniformly distributed across the object heap. Now suppose the application<br>
needs to create an object that's too big to fit in any of the available gaps in the object<br>
heap. Under these circumstances, the application would come to a grinding halt and the<br>
only thing the user could do is quit and restart the application (if the computer doesn't<br>
crash).
</p>
<p>
<b>DETECTING ACCESS FAULTS</b>
</p>
<p>
Discovering access faults is easy. The Power Mac Debugger loudly, almost proudly,<br>
proclaims, "Access Fault." If luck is with you, your machine doesn't crash or lock up.<br>
Identifying the cause of an access fault is another matter. If the access fault involves a<br>
TObject-based object, that means the application attempted to access an object that<br>
doesn't exist. There are two ways that can happen: Perhaps the object was created, then<br>
destroyed, and now the application attempts to access it. Or maybe it was never created<br>
in the first place.
</p>
<p>
Object display can help you identify the offending object by providing an ordered<br>
record of what was created and what was destroyed. If you've been testing with object<br>
display on, you will have become familiar with what your application is doing. Then<br>
the trick is to single step up to the point of the access fault without failing. At that<br>
point, you should know which object the application is attempting to access. You can<br>
carefully examine the results of the object display to determine the source of the<br>
problem.
</p>
<p>
<b>Access fault of the first kind. </b>One type of access fault, which I'll call an access<br>
fault of the first kind, arises from creating a TObject-based object, freeing it, and<br>
then attempting to access it. Because it was freed, it no longer exists, so attempting to<br>
access it causes an access fault.
</p>
<p>
When I was first teaching myself about MacApp's scripting capability, I made the<br>
mistake of taking some MacApp code out of context and using it as a template in Twist<br>
Down Lists. It was clearly the wrong thing to do because it resulted in an access fault of<br>
the first kind. My mistake is illustrated by the following code, which I wrote in<br>
TTwistDownApp::GetContainedObject. I show it here so that you can try it and see for<br>
yourself how object display helps you find the first type of access fault.
</p>
<pre>TTwistDownDocument* theTwistDownDocument = NULL;
theTwistDownDocument = (TTwistDownDocument*)aDocument;
theTwistDownView = theTwistDownDocument-&gt;fTwistDownView;
TOSADispatcher::fgDispatcher-&gt;AddTemporaryToken(theTwistDownView);
result = theTwistDownView;
return result;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Of course, in due time, MacApp freed the temporary token and, later on when the<br>
application attempted to access fTwistDownView, an access fault was generated.<br>
Running the application with object display on clearly showed twistDownView being<br>
destroyed: you can't miss it and you know it's wrong. Then, a little bit of single<br>
stepping led me to the culprit. I recognized that I shouldn't have told fgDispatcher to<br>
add fTwistDownView as a temporary token. I fixed this by deleting the statement that<br>
tells fgDispatcher to add it, and then carried on.
</p>
<p>
<b>Access fault of the second kind.</b> Another kind of access fault, which I'll call an<br>
access fault of the second kind, arises from attempting to access a TObject-based object<br>
that was never created. The only access fault of this kind that I've encountered arose<br>
when I ran a script that asked the application to access a document when there were no<br>
documents. In this case, TApplication::GetContainedObject doesn't verify that the<br>
document exists before attempting to use it.
</p>
<p>
For this situation, the problem was immediately obvious. It was easily fixed by<br>
inserting into TTwistDownApp::GetContainedObject the code shown in Listing 2, which<br>
makes sure the document exists before attempting to access it.
</p>
<p>
______________________________
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 2.</b> A solution to the GetContainedObject problem
</p>
<pre>...
else if (desiredType == cDocument &amp;&amp; selectionForm == formName) {
   CStr255   theName;
   selectionData.GetString(theName);
   CNoGhostDocsIterator iter(this);

 
   for (TDocument* aDocument = iter.FirstDocument(); iter.More();
         aDocument = iter.NextDocument()) {
      if (aDocument != NULL) {
         CStr255 name = gEmptyString;
         aDocument-&gt;GetTitle(name);
         if (name == theName) {
            theTwistDownDocument = (TTwistDownDocument*)aDocument;
            result = theTwistDownDocument;
            return result;
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
______________________________
</p>
<p>
This case demonstrates the wisdom of trying to break your application by attempting to<br>
get it to do outlandish things that no sane person would try. That's precisely how I<br>
stumbled on this one.
</p>
<p>
<b>Access fault of the third kind.</b> All other access faults I've defined as access faults<br>
of the third kind: they are, strictly speaking, outside the scope of MacApp. They arise<br>
from mistakes you made when working with the system software -- for example,<br>
failing to clear a parameter block before using it. As a result, object display isn't quite<br>
as helpful at tracking down these access faults as it is with finding access faults<br>
involving TObject-based objects. If you're lucky, object display will point you in the<br>
general area of the problem.
</p>
<p>
The MacApp application IconEdit gives us an example. Along with the other files that<br>
accompany this article, I've provided a test script, a modified version of the IconEdit<br>
source code, and many IconEdit documents to help you conduct the following<br>
experiment:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the partition size of IconEdit to its minimum of 1506.</li>
<li>Make and save about 25 IconEdit documents.</li>
<li>Quit IconEdit to quickly get rid of all the open documents.</li>
<li>Make a script that tells IconEdit to open all the saved documents.</li>
<li>Run the script.</li>
</ol>
<p>
When IconEdit runs out of memory while being driven by the script, it will generate<br>
an access fault of the third kind and drop into MacsBug with a bus error. This should<br>
occur after the 22nd document has been opened and the script is telling IconEdit to<br>
open the 24th saved document. The 23rd document has failed to open for lack of<br>
memory, and the application is attempting to recover, yet the script has gone beyond<br>
that point and is telling the application to open the 24th document. (Note that you'd<br>
need to use a lot more documents to duplicate this condition if you didn't compile with<br>
the substitute PlatformMemory files, which implement object heap discipline, as<br>
described later.)
</p>
<p>
The problem occurs when the application attempts to return an out-of-memory<br>
message to the script. Specifically, TAppleEvent::WriteLong generates another error<br>
when it attempts to complete the reply Apple event that's supposed to tell the script<br>
about the out-of-memory condition.
</p>
<p>
This is a case where the techniques described in this article don't help you very much<br>
and may actually hinder you. I didn't do anything wrong, but I did spend time proving<br>
that I didn't do anything wrong. Once I got assurance that all the TObject-descended<br>
objects in my application appeared to be OK, I decided to see if IconEdit had the same<br>
problem. It did.
</p>
<p>
In due time, I noticed that the TServerCommand constructor sets fSuspendTheEvent to<br>
FALSE. TServerCommand is an ancestor of TODocCommand, which is responsible for<br>
opening existing documents. At that point, I had nothing to lose by setting its value to<br>
TRUE. That fixed the problem.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Be warned that </b>the experts will tell you that fSuspendTheEvent should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never be set to TRUE because doing so can be dangerous. I've disregarded their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advice with no better rationale than that it appears to allow IconEdit and Twist<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down Lists to survive without crashing when I run a script that sends open<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;document commands until the application fails for lack of memory. As of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writing I haven't found a more acceptable workaround.*
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPLEMENTING OBJECT DISPLAY</b>
</p>
<p>
To implement object display, you can plug in the substitute UObject.h and UObject.cp<br>
files. (Implementation details are provided in "EN1 - Object Counting and Display.")<br>
In addition, four new methods need to be added to TObject:
</p>
<pre>#if qDebug
void TObject::PrintConstructorClassInfo();
void TObject::PrintDestructorClassInfo();
void TObject::PrintAppConstructorClassInfo();
void TObject::PrintAppDestructorClassInfo();
#endif</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The constructors and destructors of all objects for which you want to be able to display<br>
object information must be modified to call the appropriate method. For MacApp<br>
objects, use the following code in the constructor:
</p>
<pre>#if qDebug
this-&gt;PrintConstructorClassInfo();
#endif</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
and this code in the destructor:
</p>
<pre>#if qDebug
this-&gt;PrintDestructorClassInfo();
#endif</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You may not want to call these methods in TEvent and TToolboxEvent. The Macintosh<br>
specializes in generating events, so displaying object information for them can be<br>
overwhelming. In your application objects, use the following code in the constructor:
</p>
<pre>#if qDebug
this-&gt;PrintAppConstructorClassInfo();
#endif</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
and this code in the destructor:
</p>
<pre>#if qDebug
this-&gt;PrintAppDestructorClassInfo();
#endif</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
These calls should always be placed in the same relative position in constructors and<br>
destructors. The very beginning or the very end are the two most obvious choices. Keep<br>
in mind that although constructors don't generally make other objects, destructors<br>
frequently free other objects. If these methods are invoked at random places in the<br>
constructors and destructors, the resulting object information displayed in the log<br>
window will be very hard to interpret.
</p>
<p>
There are three flags that you can use to control the amount of object information<br>
that's displayed: gPrintBaseClassInfo, gPrintMacAppClassInfo, and gPrintAppClassInfo.<br>
These flags determine whether object information is displayed at the TObject level, for<br>
MacApp objects, or for your application's objects, respectively. All three flags can be<br>
set with scriptable menu commands. However, it's probably best to set<br>
gPrintBaseClassInfo programmatically to avoid being inundated with object<br>
information for every TToolboxEvent that's generated. Simply surround the suspect<br>
code as follows:
</p>
<pre>gPrintBaseClassInfo = TRUE;
...   // suspect code here
gPrintBaseClassInfo = FALSE;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In my experience, it's usually enough to display object information at the application<br>
level and the MacApp level. However, some MacApp objects don't have constructors and<br>
some don't have destructors. If you suspect that those objects are the source of a<br>
problem, it may be useful to display object information at the TObject level.
</p>


<h2>OBJECT HEAP DISCIPLINE</h2>
<p>
MacApp uses its own object heap to store TObject-derived objects. The heap grows as<br>
new objects are created -- by taking memory from free memory. Once memory has<br>
been allocated to the object heap, it's never returned to free memory. As things stand,<br>
the developer has little control over this situation. According to conventional wisdom,<br>
the point of greatest memory usage occurs during printing. With Twist Down Lists,<br>
memory usage problems occur when the application runs out of memory while loading<br>
a hierarchical list, especially with 680x0 versions. That meant I had two problems to<br>
deal with while testing recovery from an out-of-memory condition when loading a list:<br>
the recovery itself and the lack of available memory in which to load required code<br>
segments. I made the segment loading problem go away by implementing object heap<br>
discipline, which let me concentrate on testing failure recovery. Object heap<br>
discipline allows you to erect a barrier to further expansion of the object heap right<br>
where you want it. At the same time, it allows you to leave as much memory as is<br>
required to load code segments without having to fuss with 'seg!' and 'res!' resources.
</p>
<p>
When the object heap runs out of space, a request for a new block of memory is made<br>
with a call to the global function PlatformAllocateBlock(size_t size). The trick is to<br>
force PlatformAllocateBlock to reject the request when you want it to.
</p>
<p>
To do that, I created the global down-counter gOHRemainingIncrements to maintain a<br>
count of the number of times the object heap will be allowed to expand. Each time<br>
PlatformAllocateBlock allocates memory to the object heap, it decrements<br>
gOHRemainingIncrements. When gOHRemainingIncrements reaches 0,<br>
PlatformAllocateBlock will no longer honor requests for additional memory. The<br>
revised version of PlatformAllocateBlock is shown in Listing 3.
</p>

      ptr = NewPtr(size);               // added
      gOHRemainingIncrements--;         // added
   }                                    // added

   if (gUMemoryInitialized)
      PermAllocation(heapPerm);         // Reset perm flag before
                                        // possible Failure
   FailNIL(ptr);

   return ptr;

</p>
<p>
The initial value of gOHRemainingIncrements is set to 3 just to be safe. During<br>
initialization, MacApp makes two allocations to the object heap; if<br>
gOHRemainingIncrements is 0, the application doesn't start up because of lack of<br>
memory. The second of those allocations sets up the initial size of the object heap. If<br>
your 'mem!' resource specifies a small value for the initial size of the object heap, the<br>
initial value of gOHRemainingIncrements might have to be larger than 3.
</p>
<p>
Immediately following the call to InitUMacApp in main, the value of<br>
gOHRemainingIncrements is set with a call to the InitMaxObjectHeapSize global<br>
function, which is shown in Listing 4.
</p>
<pre>gOHRemainingIncrements = InitMaxObjectHeapSize();</pre>

   else
      theNumber = 0;

</p>
<p>
As you can see, I use a very simple algorithm to determine the number of times the<br>
object heap will be allowed to expand and still leave in free memory at least the<br>
number of bytes specified by kFreeMemReserve.
</p>
<p>
The changes you need to make to MacApp to implement object heap discipline are<br>
described in detail in "EN2 - Object Heap Discipline." The substitute<br>
PlatformMemory.h and PlatformMemory.cp files are also provided.
</p>


<h2>FAILURE HANDLING</h2>
<p>
One very good reason to use MacApp is its integrated failure handling scheme. Of<br>
course, all failure recovery paths must be tested. In a well-crafted application,<br>
failures should occur only while the application is attempting to create a new object<br>
when there's insufficient space in the object heap for it. To test these situations, the<br>
application must be forced to fail at selected points. It's not enough to adjust the<br>
partition size and hope for a failure.
</p>
<p>
Ideally, you would be able to set a failure point with a debugger in a similar manner to<br>
setting a breakpoint. That's not presently possible. Instead, in Twist Down Lists, I<br>
added a global flag gFailHere, which is set and cleared with a scriptable menu<br>
command. There are several ways to use this flag:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Insert the following code at an appropriate place in the application (this<br>
is the simplest way):</li>
</ul>
<pre>      if (gFailHere)
         Failure(errFailHere, 0);</pre>
<ul>
<li>Force a failure just after a new object has been created:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      TSomeObject* someObject = new TSomeObject;
      FailNIL(someObject);
      someObject-&gt;ISomeObject();
      if (gFailHere)
         Failure(errFailHere, 0);</pre>
<ul>
<li>Force the failure in ISomeObject:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      TSomeObject::ISomeObject()
      {
         this-&gt;IObject();
         if (gFailHere)
            Failure(errFailHere, 0);
      }</pre>
<p>
Other ways of using this technique to force a failure require application-specific<br>
knowledge. In the case of Twist Down Lists, it's often convenient to give the name<br>
FailHere to a file or folder on the volume you're going to open. With the following code,<br>
when a twistDownElement named FailHere is encountered, the failure will be<br>
triggered:
</p>
<pre>if (gFailHere) {
   CStr63 failHereText = "FailHere";
   CStr63 displayedText = gEmptyString;
   twistDownElement-&gt;GetDisplayedText(displayedText);
   if (failHereText == displayedText)
      Failure(errFailHere, 0);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
It must be possible to set and clear the gFailHere flag from a script. An application can<br>
encounter the same failure conditions whether driven from a script or from the user<br>
interface. The failure recovery path is, however, a little different. When the<br>
application is being driven by a script, an Apple event must be sent to the script<br>
telling it that a failure was encountered and what the failure was. MacApp will handle<br>
the overhead, but you must do your part: you must test it to make sure it works and<br>
returns appropriate error information to the script.
</p>
<p>
Were it not for the fact that all the list processing methods in TTwistDownDocument<br>
are recursive, I probably wouldn't have felt the need to implement gFailHere. Failure<br>
can occur if the application attempts to make a twistDownElement or a<br>
twistDownControl when there isn't enough memory in the object heap to do it and the<br>
object heap can't be further expanded. The failure might occur several levels into the<br>
recursion. You can't call ReSignal to handle the failure because you'll jump all the way<br>
up to the method that started the recursion. Instead, you must save the failure<br>
information, work your way back up the recursion, and then signal the failure.
</p>
<p>
Using gFailHere turned out to be the best way to test the failure handling. Object<br>
counting, memory display, and object display were very useful in testing recovery<br>
from these kinds of failures. Object counting and memory display verified that<br>
everything that needed to be freed was freed. Using object display to match<br>
constructions with destructions gave further confirmation that the recovery was<br>
successful.
</p>


<h2>HAPPY DEBUGGING</h2>
<p>
The debugging aids I developed illustrate the power of MacApp. By modifying the<br>
central organizing object, TObject, you can make many new capabilities, such as<br>
object counting, memory display, and object display, extend to the objects that inherit<br>
from it. In addition, you can easily modify the memory management scheme of MacApp,<br>
so implementing object heap discipline isn't hard at all. Now that I have these<br>
debugging aids, I no longer fear the dreaded memory leak and access fault. Object<br>
counting, memory display, and object display don't exactly sound an alarm when<br>
there's a TObject-based memory leak, but they come pretty close. And without object<br>
display, finding an access fault was like looking for a needle in a haystack.
</p>
<p>
The faster you can fix your mistakes, the faster you can finish your applications. I<br>
hope my debugging aids will help you get those applications out even quicker.
