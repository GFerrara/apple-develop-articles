<h1>Newton Q &amp; A: Ask the Llama</h1>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Now that Newton 2.0 is shipping, what has changed?</i><br>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;A fair question, and one that's been much on my mind. Newton 2.0 solves some of<br>
the problems previously presented in this column in much better ways. So I've gone<br>
back over old questions to see what has changed. I'll start out this time by revisiting<br>
those questions that have new answers. (Questions that dealt with subsystems whose<br>
APIs on the Newton 2.0 OS are drastically different will not be covered; most of these<br>
have to do with routing, which has undergone a significant change for the better, while<br>
some have to do with communications.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>How do I create my own class of binary object? (Issue 18)</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;In the Newton 1.x OS you had to use SetClass on a string object to make some other<br>
binary object. In 2.0 you can just call the new function MakeBinary. So the line of code<br>
to define the canonical CharID object (see the original answer) changes to
</p>
<pre>DefConst('kDefaultCharIDOBj, MakeBinary(4, 'CharID));</pre>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I would like to add a [button|view|Llama] to [Notes|Dates|Names| etc.]. How can I do</i><br>
<i>that safely? (Issue 19)</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;In the Newton 1.x OS there was no supported way to add items to the built-in<br>
applications. In 2.0 there are a few ways you can do this.
</p>
<p>
For general changes, you can add new stationery to Notes, Dates, and Names. For<br>
example, you could add graph paper to Notes. You could also define new card styles or<br>
views of a person in Names.
</p>
<p>
Names and Dates also let you add whole new classes of things. For instance, you could<br>
add a Pet type of names entry that would appear in the New pop-up menu along with<br>
Person, Company, and Group.
</p>
<p>
The Dates application has an API to add new types of meetings. It also lets you add items<br>
to its Info button.
</p>
<p>
In addition, there's a general API to register buttons that can show up in the "blessed"<br>
application's status bar. It's up to each application to decide whether and how it will<br>
display registered buttons. You should no longer use the unsupported keyboardChicken<br>
hack.
</p>
<p>
Note that on the Newton 2.0 platform there's still no support for adding buttons to<br>
built-in slips. For example, if you wanted to add something to the alarm picker for a<br>
meeting, you would need to add a new type of stationery that's a superset of the alarm<br>
picker.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I've written my own IsASCIIAlpha, IsASCIINumeric, etc. functions. They seem to be</i><br>
<i>really slow. Why is that? Here's my IsASCIIAlpha: [code not repeated here; all the</i><br>
<i>functions work on strings] (Issue 20)</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;Most of the comments from the original answer still hold. However, in the Newton<br>
2.0 OS the string could be a rich string; that is, there could be an ink character inside<br>
the string. That means the compare functions have to check whether a particular<br>
character was kInkChar.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>When I try to add an index to my soup I sometimes get an exception -48019, but not</i><br>
<i>always. What's going on? (Issue 22)</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;In early versions of Newton, if you added an index on a slot, and an entry in that<br>
soup had a value of nil for that slot, you would get an error. As of the Newton 2.0 OS<br>
this is no longer a problem. You can add an index even if there are entries with nil<br>
values for the slot in the soup.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I have an application that uses ADSP to connect to a server on the desktop. I want the</i><br>
<i>server to handle multiple Newton devices connected simultaneously. Unfortunately, if</i><br>
<i>a connection fails after it's opened, the server doesn't seem to be able to identify it as a</i><br>
<i>new connection when the Newton device reconnects. This causes problems in the</i><br>
<i>server's ability to handle multiple connections. Can you help? (Issue 23)</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;In the Newton 2.0 OS this no longer occurs. The Newton device will generate a new<br>
ID for the connection.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Since there are changes between Newton 1.x and 2.0, what features in 2.0 can I rely</i><br>
<i>on? What is the core set that defines Newton 2.0?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;At this time there is no published core set of NewtonScript-level features that you<br>
can rely on. We're confident that you can rely on the features of the NewtonScript<br>
language and major components like the view system and communication endpoint<br>
interface. However, you can't count on individual protos or even the internal<br>
applications being there. Since we license Newton technology to other companies, they<br>
could produce a Newton device that doesn't include Names, Dates, or other built-in<br>
features. They may also produce Newton devices that have features that aren't present<br>
in Apple products.
</p>
<p>
The key is to test the features you rely on. If you find that some of the features you<br>
need are missing, you can either run in a less-featured mode or just not open your<br>
application. As a simple example, suppose your application runs only in a limited set<br>
of screen sizes and aspect ratios. You can give your base application view a<br>
viewSetupFormScript that looks something like this:
</p>
<pre>myBaseView.viewSetupFormScript := func()
begin
    local screenSize := GetAppParams();
    local aspectRatio := screenSize.appAreaWidth /
                                screenSize.appAreaHeight;

    // very simplistic test, no MINIMUM even!
    if aspectRatio &gt; 1.0 then    // landscape
    begin
        local maxHeight := kMaxAppWidth;
        local maxWidth := kMaxAppHeight;
    end;
    else begin                      // portrait or square
        local maxHeight := kMaxAppHeight;
        local maxWidth := kMaxAppWidth;
    end;

    if screenSize.appAreaWidth &lt;= maxWidth AND
        screenSize.appAreaHeight &lt;= maxHeight then
    begin
        self.viewBounds := RelBounds(...);
        // other setup stuff
        ...
    end
    else begin
        // cannot operate at screen size
        :Notify(kNotifyAlert, EnsureInternal(kAppName),
            EnsureInternal(kErrorWrongScreenSize));
        AddDeferredSend(self, 'Close, nil);
    end;
end;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
For global functions and variables, you can use the GlobalFnExists and GlobalVarExists<br>
utility functions. To find out whether a built-in application exists, you can check the<br>
root view with the appropriate symbol:
</p>
<pre>// check for Dates
if GetRoot().calendar then
    ...
// check for Names
if GetRoot().cardfile then
    ...
// check for Extras
if GetRoot().extrasDrawer then
    ...</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
For protos, you can try to access the proto and catch a frame reference exception. If<br>
the exception occurs, the proto is not present.
</p>
<p>
In general, it's a wise idea to do all your existence testing as your application is<br>
launching. Set flags in your base application so that you test for existing features only<br>
once.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Is there a hardware-unique ID that I can access on a Newton device?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;At this time there's no built-in hardware-unique ID, nor is there an API for<br>
accessing one if it existed. However, this doesn't rule out having such an API in future<br>
Newton devices.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'm using a Newton 2.0 protoSoupOverview and I want to change the font style. How do</i><br>
<i>I do that?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;This is one of those things that are obvious once you make the connection. You use<br>
the Abstract method of protoSoupOverview (and protoOverview, for that matter) to<br>
build the shape that's displayed for a particular soup entry. Notice that you're<br>
returning a shape, with all that entails. The chapter on drawing in the <i>Newton</i><br>
<i>Programmer's Guide</i> says you can include a styles entry in a shape array, allowing you<br>
to specify things like font style. See the DTS Sample Code Checkbook on the Newton<br>
Developer CD for an example.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I noticed that some of the built-in applications have keyboards in their slips -- for</i><br>
<i>example, the new name editor in the Names file. Is this stationery based? Is there a</i><br>
<i>magic slot I can set? Is there a proto?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;Those keyboards are just views based on protoKeypad that are laid out as a child<br>
view of the slip. All you need to do is lay out your own protoKeypad and set up the<br>
definitions appropriately. There is no supported magic slot.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i> I'm trying to use a protoListPicker to display a soup structure that has nested frame</i><br>
<i>entries. I can't get the listPicker to work. Am I doing something wrong?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>&nbsp;No. The default listPicker proto doesn't work with items that are accessed via path<br>
expressions. However, if you make the following three changes, your listPicker should<br>
work fine.
</p>
<p>
First, you have to specialize the GetObjSlot method of your pickerDef:
</p>
<pre>GetObjSlot: func(item, fieldPath)
begin
    if ClassOf(fieldPath) &lt;&gt; 'pathExpr then
        // if not a path expression, return the inherited value
        return inherited:GetObjSlot(item, fieldPath);

    // otherwise, if there is no item, return nil
    if not item then
        return nil;

    // there is an item, so get the real value, since the item
    // could be a NameRef or an Entry
    if IsNameRef(item) then
        local val := EntryFromObj(item);
    else
        val := item;

    // assuming we have a real thing, access the real data via the
    // path expression in fieldPath
    if val then
        val.(fieldPath);
end</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Second, if you specify a validation frame in for your listPicker, the nesting of that<br>
frame must match the nesting of your soup entry.
</p>
<p>
Finally, modify your pickerDef so that the column that displays the data based on the<br>
index path uses the appropriate index path.
