There are a ton of different ways to learn to shoot pool. You can just bash the balls<br>
around, trying to pocket them, and eventually you'll get better at it. You can play<br>
games with other people, which increases the motivation somewhat, and probably<br>
learn a little faster. (Some people claim you should always play for money, because it<br>
makes it matter so much more.) But one of the most powerful ways to practice pool is<br>
plain old drill: setting up the same situation over and over, trying to make the shot a<br>
little better, a little more accurate, every time. Concentrated, repetitive drill is<br>
incredibly helpful in the early stages of learning the game, but it doesn't stop there.<br>
Drill remains a useful practice method virtually forever. Many experts who have been<br>
playing for 30 years still do regular drills, and still benefit from them.
</p>
<p>
But this stands in sharp contrast to programming, another skill I like to exercise (and<br>
analyze). Drill can be useful for programming neophytes, for learning such things as<br>
typing and the syntax of the language. But no experienced programmers I know engage<br>
in regular drill. The thought is actually ludicrous. What would you do? Write the same<br>
loop over and over, trying to do it a little faster or more accurately each time? Create<br>
a Hello World program from scratch 100 times in a row so that it becomes automatic?<br>
I don't think so.
</p>
<p>
So what's the difference between learning programming and learning pool? Why does<br>
drill have lasting value for one but not the other?
</p>
<p>
A worthy question, I thought to myself. It's deep enough that the answer should take a<br>
while to find, and interesting enough that the journey will keep my attention. So I<br>
girded myself for a long and arduous quest, set off smartly to find the answer, and<br>
stumbled over it immediately: drill is useful for learning mechanics -- like<br>
high-precision muscular tasks -- but it isn't very useful for learning high-level<br>
problem-solving skills. Since experienced programmers spend most of their time on<br>
problem solving and very little on mechanics, drill just isn't an effective tool for<br>
getting better at programming once you're past the early stages.
</p>
<p>
Well, jeez, that was too easy. Isn't there more to it than that? Surely there must be<br>
deep and profound differences between learning to shoot pool and learning to program,<br>
since the tasks themselves are so completely different. Programming is like -- well,<br>
you know what it's like, or you wouldn't be reading develop. It's mostly abstract and<br>
logical, and most of the real action takes place deep in your head or deep in the<br>
machine, far from the real world. Shooting pool is something else altogether. It's<br>
unabashedly physical, it often defies logic, and the action takes place where everyone<br>
can see it, on a huge table made of wood and slate and rubber and cloth.
</p>
<p>
I started playing pool fairly seriously several months ago, and I'm still<br>
embarrassingly terrible at it. In my typical overenthusiastic, obsessive-compulsive<br>
fashion, I dove in with both feet: I researched pool at the library, bought and read pool<br>
books, studied pool videotapes, cruised the Net for pool stuff, and jabbered about pool<br>
to anyone who came within earshot. The result was perhaps predictable. In no time, my<br>
knowledge of pool theory completely outstripped my ability to put it into practice. So<br>
although I could often see what to do in a certain situation, I couldn't actually do it. All<br>
bark, no bite.
</p>
<p>
To rectify this situation I started doing the only thing that would help: practicing<br>
doggedly. I took a lesson from a good instructor, and started hanging out at the pool hall<br>
as much as possible, putting in the practice time. Of course I was hoping that I'd<br>
suddenly make remarkable improvements in my game. But remarkable improvement<br>
is tough to come by in pool.
</p>
<p>
At first glance pool seems like it should be very straightforward. You have nearly<br>
perfect spheres undergoing nearly perfectly elastic collisions, so the paths of the balls<br>
should be nearly perfectly predictable, right? Wrong. Like most things that take place<br>
in the real world (as opposed to inside a computer), there's a whole seething world of<br>
subtleties and nonlinearities and complexities just beneath the surface. The actual<br>
grungy details -- the drag of the cloth, the spin of the balls, the fleeting grip they<br>
have on each other when they collide -- all affect the paths of the balls profoundly, and<br>
are so complex and intertwined that people argue endlessly about what's really going<br>
on. Superstitions, theories, rough approximations, and empirical formulas abound.<br>
And all this complexity is set in motion in one tiny instant, by the impact of a chalked<br>
leather cue tip on a smooth plastic ball for a few milliseconds. If you ever needed an<br>
example of something with a sensitive dependence on initial conditions, this is a doozy.
</p>
<p>
Because of its complexity and sensitivity, progress in pool is slow no matter how you<br>
approach it. Playing pool is one of those things you can do all your life and keep getting<br>
better at, like playing a musical instrument. And like learning an instrument, just<br>
playing is lots of fun, and can be fine practice. But concentrated drill on the basics,<br>
especially for a beginner like me, helps in a way no other kind of practice can. When I<br>
started regularly doing drills, the effect on my game was immediate and tangible (if<br>
not as remarkable as I might have liked).
</p>
<p>
Good drill in pool involves intentional, conscious moving of your muscles the same way<br>
over and over, paying attention to the details of arm position, follow-through,<br>
rhythm, aim, and so on. You're trying to consciously train your muscles to learn the<br>
motions, so that those motions can be performed unconsciously later. To use a handy<br>
computing metaphor (always a good idea when talking to programmers), drill is like<br>
programming an EPROM: it pushes something that initially requires conscious control<br>
(the software) down into the unconscious realm (the hardware). Drill helps you<br>
deliberately "wear grooves" in your brain.
</p>
<p>
But that kind of "hardware" programming happens with any learning experience; it's<br>
not unique to drill. In fact, that's what learning is. Drill is just one kind of focused,<br>
repetitive practice that helps you learn certain things faster. All learning involves<br>
pushing stuff "down into the hardware." (And I mean that literally: scientists are<br>
starting to identify the physical changes that happen in brains when animals learn.) To<br>
muddle my metaphors a little, learning is like climbing an endless terraced hill,<br>
where what you learn becomes the ground you stand on to reach the next level. Details<br>
that once required your full attention get tucked down into the unconscious realm and<br>
are hidden, in the same way that the details of your code get tucked down into<br>
subroutines and are forgotten. The point is this: once you learn anything, you can<br>
climb up on top of it, and other things that were unreachable before are brought<br>
within your grasp.
</p>
<p>
In my zeal to uncover the differences between learning pool and learning<br>
programming, I failed to notice the most remarkable thing of all: their similarity. The<br>
two goals couldn't be more different. Programming is the crafting of precision<br>
machinery in a tightly controlled environment; pool is poking a ball with a stick<br>
(albeit in precise and skillful ways). Yet learning the two skills -- for that matter,<br>
learning anything -- is the same process. In fact, the more examples of learning I<br>
looked at, trying to categorize and separate them, the more the differences faded and<br>
the similarities came into focus.
</p>
<p>
In every case, learning is the same kind of journey. We climb that tiered structure,<br>
that terraced hill, standing on what we've learned before so that we can reach the new<br>
stuff. We slowly convert tasks that initially require our full attention into automatic,<br>
mechanical ones, and that conversion to mechanics is what allows us to turn our<br>
attention to more meaningful, higher-level tasks.
</p>
<p>
Attention seems to be the limiting factor here -- we don't have much of it. Reaching<br>
once again for the low-hanging fruit on the computational metaphor tree, attention is<br>
like a single-threaded program with a tiny stack: we can only pay attention to a small<br>
handful of things at a time. The funny thing is that our brains aren't single threaded at<br>
all. Far from it! They are unbelievably prodigious and capacious things, and they<br>
actually are handling all the details, all the way down. We just aren't aware of it. And<br>
believe me, that's a good thing.
</p>
<p>
Without some way to convert conscious activities into unconscious ones, to push the<br>
details down out of sight -- to program ourselves -- we'd never get anywhere. Our<br>
meager helping of attention would be used up in no time. If we had to struggle with<br>
typing and syntax on every line of code we wrote, we'd never get the program written.<br>
If we had to consciously move each and every muscle all the time, we actually wouldn't<br>
be able to walk and chew gum at the same time -- plain old standing around would<br>
probably be out of the question, much less hitting the cue ball with a little right<br>
English to sink the eleven ball and go two rails down table to get position on the<br>
thirteen. Lucky for us, the ability to program ourselves is built in. With a little<br>
desire and disciplined practice, we can do truly amazing things.
</p>
<p>
And oh, I do want to sink that thirteen ball. I really, really do...
