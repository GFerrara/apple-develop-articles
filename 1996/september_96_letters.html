<b>NURB CURVES TYPO</b><br>
I'm an M.S. student in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Bogazici<br>
University, Istanbul, Turkey. My thesis is about pattern recognition using&nbsp;&nbsp;implicit<br>
polynomials in CAD applications. While I was surfing the Internet, I found the article<br>
"NURB Curves:&nbsp;&nbsp;A Guide for the Uninitiated" in develop Issue 25 and read it. It's a very<br>
good resource for those (like me) with minimal knowledge of NURB curves and<br>
representations, and I liked it a lot.<br>
<p>
But in Figure 20 there's a mistake, I think. Control point B (2) has coordinates {2, 0,<br>
0}, but I believe the last index (w) should be 1. Is that right?<br>

<p>
<i>Yes, in fact you've found a typographical error in the figure you mention: B (2) should</i><br>
<i>be {2, 0, 1}. We had a very good editor and several reviewers, but none of them caught</i><br>
<i>this. I hope it doesn't mislead anyone too much. Thanks for pointing it out.</i><br>

<b>TECHNICAL Q&amp;A: WHERE?</b><br>
In the Issue 25 Macintosh Q&amp;A,&nbsp;&nbsp;you explain a new method for embedding GX pictures<br>
into QuickDraw PICT files. It says that we can find sample code in the Macintosh <br>
Technical Q&amp;A "Embedding a GX Picture into a PICT" (GX 07). Unfortunately, I haven't<br>
found this file on any developer CD I have. Could you please help me locate this<br>
information?<br>
-- Michel Renon
</p>
<p>
<i>That Q&amp;A can be found on the&nbsp;&nbsp;Web at</i><br>
<i>http://dev.info.apple.com/techqa/qdgx/gx07.html. In general, the Web site</i><br>
<i>http://dev.info.apple.com/techqa/Main.html has the latest and greatest Macintosh</i><br>
<i>Technical Q&amp;As. They some- times take a while to find their way to the CDs, and that</i><br>
<i>was the case here.&nbsp;&nbsp;That Q&amp;A is now available on the CDs as well. Sorry for any</i><br>
<i>inconvenience.</i><br>

<b>TIME-SAVING TIPS</b><br>
I really enjoyed Bo3b Johnson's Veteran Neophyte column in Issue 25 about ways to<br>
avoid wasting time. After programming the Mac for 10 years, I'm finally learning<br>
many of the things he talked about. It' s funny looking back at&nbsp;&nbsp;all the mistakes I've<br>
made while thinking I was so smart.
</p>
<p>
I worked at Berkeley Systems on&nbsp;&nbsp;After Dark. One of the first things I did was&nbsp;&nbsp;write<br>
the&nbsp;&nbsp;Warp (or starfield) screen saver. I came up with a really cool assembly routine<br>
that, given an x and y, would draw the pixel on any monitor at any bit depth. It was a<br>
complicated routine (remember, I'm very smart) that used lots of shifts, multiplies,<br>
and divides. Even though I commented it, I still had to sit down and work through it<br>
each time I needed to make a change. Finally a coworker asked why I didn't just write a<br>
separate routine for each bit depth. I scoffed and said my routine was really cool.<br>
Needless to say, I rewrote it into separate routines; it was really easy, and is easy to<br>
maintain and change as well.
</p>
<p>
These days, instead of banging my head trying to come up with a "smart" way&nbsp;&nbsp;to do<br>
things, I just code in the most straightforward way I know how. I'm finding that I have<br>
better things to do than screw around with a triply linked list that looked good in Dr.<br>
Dobbs but isn't really appropriate for my problem. I hate reliance on C-isms that<br>
aren't obvious: if you have to pull out the&nbsp;&nbsp;ANSI C book to figure it out, it isn't good<br>
code.
</p>
<p>
By the way, another good book is&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Psychology of Computer Programming </i>by Gerald<br>
M.&nbsp;&nbsp;Weinberg. It was written in&nbsp;&nbsp;1971 but has some very interesting views on<br>
programming and programmers.<br>

I'm not a windsurfer, but I am a Mac developer, so I read Bo3b Johnson's column in<br>
Issue 25 with great interest. My boss (Markus Fest, the programmer of Toast<br>
CD-ROM Pro) told me it was a Pflichtlekt&#220;re (something you just gotta read). He was<br>
right.
</p>
<p>
There's a book that should have been in your Recommended Reading section: <i>Code</i><br>
<i>Complete by Steve McConnell </i>(Microsoft Press, 1993). It's worth checking out.<br>
Enjoy!<br>
-- Florian Dejako

<i>It's amusing to look back and see how we learned the things we did, and how they' ve</i><br>
<i>helped or hindered us. That introspection is&nbsp;&nbsp;actually what spawned the column: I</i><br>
<i>realized that maybe others could avoid those&nbsp;&nbsp;mistakes if they read about them in</i><br>
<i>advance.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>To this day I run into arguments about using the full "power" of C/C++. I hate to see</i><br>
<i>people writing code just to use some feature of C++ like operator overloading. If they</i><br>
<i>can redirect that creative energy to&nbsp;&nbsp;figuring out a better algorithm, it's a total win.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I think restrictions can actually be liberating, by freeing you from having to think</i><br>
<i>about everything. If the brace style in code were enforced, how many hours of wasted</i><br>
<i>brain time would we get back? Having the meaningless stuff like brace style fixed in</i><br>
<i>stone makes it easier to apply cleverness to the things that matter, like the quality of</i><br>
<i>the software.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>And Florian: thanks. I've never been called a Pflichtlekt&#220;re before, but I kinda like it.</i><br>
