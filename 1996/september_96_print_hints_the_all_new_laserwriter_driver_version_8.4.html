<h1>Print Hints: The All-New LaserWriter Driver<br>
Version 8.4</h1>
<h2>Dave Polaschek</h2>

</p>
<p>
By the time you read this, version 8.4 of the LaserWriter 8 printer driver will have<br>
shipped. This driver -- LaserWriter version 8.4, for short -- is not the same old<br>
LaserWriter driver: it has new features that developers have been asking for, sports a<br>
new user interface, and beats earlier versions of the driver in the quarter mile.
</p>
<p>
Here I'll outline some of the changes -- a few minor, a few major -- that you need to<br>
be aware of for compatibility reasons. Even if you don't want to take advantage of any of<br>
the great new features, you'll at least need to address compatibility issues if any of the<br>
changes cause problems with your application.
</p>
<p>
To help you implement the new features, this column is backed up with detailed<br>
documentation on this issue's CD.
</p>
<h2>THE EXTENDED PRINT RECORD</h2>
<p>
The 120-byte print record in the previous driver version doesn't have as many free<br>
bits available as some programmers would like. So to let you save all possible printing<br>
information about a document, Apple decided to allow for extensible print records.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If all you want to do is maintain compatibility with the new driver version, you<br>
shouldn't need to change your application at all. But if you want to take advantage of the<br>
extended print record -- and implement attractive features such as access to a larger<br>
number of paper sizes, tray handling that works with the PrJobMerge function, and<br>
the ability to reliably save more user settings from the Page Setup dialog -- you do<br>
need to make some minor changes, along the following lines:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the extended print record can be any size larger than 120 bytes,<br>
your application must not make any assumptions about the record's size.</li>
<li>Although the locations of fields that are currently defined within the<br>
TPrint structure won't change, you should use PrGeneral with the extended<br>
print record opcodes (described below) to access any additional fields.</li>
<li>When using an extended print record, you'll need to call the<br>
extendPrDefault and extendPrValidate functions where you previously would<br>
have called the functions PrintDefault and PrValidate. (The new extend<br>
functions really just call PrGeneral with specific opcodes, but are more<br>
convenient to use than PrGeneral itself.) See "Extending the Print Record" on<br>
this issue's CD for more information on the extend functions and how they use<br>
the new PrGeneral opcodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Those who break the rules might need to make more changes. See the Print Hints<br>
column in <i>develop</i> Issue 26 ("The Top 10 Printing Crimes Revisited") for more<br>
information.
</p>
<h2>NEW PRGENERAL OPCODES</h2>
<p>
LaserWriter version 8.4 adds three new PrGeneral opcodes for dealing with the<br>
extended print record: kExtendPrintRecOp (which extends the print record),<br>
kGetExtendedPrintRecOp, and kSetExtendedPrintRecOp.
</p>
<p>
Table 1 gives a complete list of all the PrGeneral opcodes as of June 1996 (but be<br>
aware that printing in Mac OS 8 might not implement all of these). These opcodes are<br>
all planned to be supported by LaserWriter version 8.4, except for the ones that aren't<br>
used by LaserWriter 8 (as noted in the table). Refer to the article "Meet PrGeneral"<br>
in develop Issue 3 for more information about PrGeneral.
</p>

<h2>NEW PRINT DIALOGS</h2>
<p>
The print dialogs have been completely redesigned for LaserWriter version 8.4.
</p>
<p>
Applications that use the approved method of extending the print dialogs will continue<br>
to function. But if your application uses a nonstandard method of extending the print<br>
dialogs, it's in trouble. The definitive source about how to extend a print dialog is<br>
PDlog Expand, available as sample code on this issue's CD and included with the<br>
Macintosh Technical Note "Print Dialogs: Adding Items" (PR 09).
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The new print dialogs have a pop-up menu that lets the user select between multiple<br>
panes of the dialog. In Figure 1, the General pane has been selected from the pop-up<br>
menu. When an application adds items to the print dialog, they're added to a pane that<br>
has the name of the application. Because of this new multipane dialog, applications that<br>
extend the print dialogs in a nonstandard manner will cause many problems, such as<br>
dialog items appearing in the wrong locations, standard items being overwritten<br>
within the dialog, and standard items being drawn incorrectly.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Applications also shouldn't assume that the print dialog's foreground color is black or<br>
that the background color is white. Furthermore, when applications exit their CDEFs<br>
or user items, they should be careful to leave the foreground and background colors as<br>
they found them. Other items in the dialog rely on these colors, so if you change them<br>
the standard controls in the print dialog could take on unusual colors.
</p>
<h2>ONE-PASS PRINTING</h2>
<p>
With LaserWriter version 8.4, when background printing is disabled, printing is<br>
one-pass. This means that there are no longer any big spool files to fill up your hard<br>
drive, and the first printed page comes out of the printer more quickly (because it<br>
doesn't have to wait for the entire document to spool). The downside is that because the<br>
LaserWriter driver isn't making two passes over the data to be printed, it might not be<br>
able to perform the same optimizations on the PostScript(TM) code as when<br>
background printing is enabled.
</p>
<p>
As a result, jobs printed with background printing disabled might print more slowly,<br>
and in a few cases the final quality could suffer.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advent of one-pass printing,<br>
if your application has its own PostScript LaserPrep dictionary, it should use the<br>
PREC 103 mechanism for this dictionary. With this mechanism, the driver downloads<br>
to the printer the PostScript dictionary contained in the PREC 103 resource before<br>
it's needed by application-generated PostScript code. If the application doesn't do this<br>
and defines its own PostScript procedures at the page level, these procedures will be<br>
undefined as part of the one-pass font-handling mechanism and you'll get PostScript<br>
errors (mostly undefined operators, because the operators you defined aren't there).
</p>
<h2>PORTIONS OF THE CODE IN SHARED LIBRARIES</h2>
<p>
Some of the functionality of LaserWriter version 8.4 has been broken out into shared<br>
libraries, including the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Converter library -- generation of PostScript code</li>
<li>PPD library -- parsing of the PostScript printer description file</li>
<li>Preferences and Collection libraries -- storage and retrieval of<br>
preferences file data</li>
<li>Downloader library -- downloading of PostScript and EPS files to a<br>
printer</li>
<li>PostScript Utilities library -- PostScript utility functions</li>
<li>Communications library -- communications</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the future, Apple may provide APIs to these shared libraries for third parties.
</p>
<h2>CHANGES TO PARSING AND HANDLING OF PPD FILES</h2>
<p>
If you're a printer developer, you should know that the way PPD files are parsed and<br>
handled has changed in LaserWriter version 8.4. Previous versions of the driver<br>
would supply a "Printer's Default" choice so that the user could choose not to decide<br>
about a certain feature and accept the default setting of the printer. With version 8.4,<br>
the driver will no longer provide this option. If PPD creators want to continue to have<br>
a Printer's Default option for a user interface feature (called UIFeature in the PPD<br>
specification), they'll have to add it to the PPD file in the list of options for that<br>
feature.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, common features available through the PPD file will be added to the correct<br>
pane of the print dialog. Features that aren't recognized or that are vendor-specific<br>
will be placed in their own pane. This can cause problems: if you use a nonstandard<br>
naming convention for a common feature, it will be placed with all other unknown<br>
features, and if you use a standard name for a nonstandard feature, it will probably end<br>
up in the wrong location.
</p>
<p>
One other change is that you can specify the graphic elements you'd like to use for UI<br>
features specified within the PPD file. See "LaserWriter 8.4 PPDs" on the CD for<br>
information about how to design your own pane for use with LaserWriter version 8.4.<br>
The latest Apple PPD files are the best examples of how to implement the new features.
</p>
<h2>NEW ERROR CODES</h2>
<p>
LaserWriter 8 introduced a number of new error codes, but they haven't been<br>
documented -- until now, that is. See the unofficial documentation "LaserWriter 8<br>
Errors" on the CD. Future versions of this document will be released as Technotes. <br>
These error codes are provided for debugging purposes. Be aware that they may change<br>
in the future, so you probably don't want your application to depend on them.
</p>
<h2>WRAPPING IT UP</h2>
<p>
That's a quick rundown of the new features of the newest version of the LaserWriter<br>
driver. These features should make printing a better experience for the user, should<br>
give the developer more flexibility, and should require no changes to most<br>
applications. And to top it all off, they're cool!
