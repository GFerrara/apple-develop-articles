<h1>The OpenDoc Road: Facilitating Part Editor<br>
Unloading</h1>

<p>
In the traditional application model, the code for an application typically remains<br>
loaded until the process quits. In OpenDoc, starting with version 1.0.1, a part editor is<br>
loaded when it's needed during a session and unloaded when it's not. As a result,<br>
valuable memory space can be reclaimed and reused by other part editors.
</p>
<p>
Even though part editor unloading is mostly transparent to part editors, there are a<br>
few things a part editor should do to ensure the success of this scheme. I'll describe<br>
these things after giving you a closer look at how part editor unloading works. Pay<br>
careful attention, because the crash you prevent may be your own.

<h2>HOW PART EDITOR UNLOADING WORKS</h2>
<p>
The part editor unloading mechanism is enabled by facilities provided by<br>
SOMobjects(TM) for Mac OS (the Apple implementation for the Macintosh of the IBM<br>
SOM(TM) technology). The basis of part editor unloading is a reference-counting<br>
system that enables OpenDoc to keep track of which part objects are in use. I'll explain<br>
reference counting and then give the gory details of how part libraries are unloaded,<br>
which differs for static and dynamic classes.
</p>
<p>
Every persistent object (part, frame, link, and so on) in OpenDoc is given a reference<br>
count by the draft that creates it. When the object is first created or acquired, its<br>
reference count is initialized to 1. Whenever the object is acquired after that (through<br>
either the draft's or the object's Acquire method), its reference count is incremented<br>
by 1. Whenever the object is released (by a call to the object's Release method), its<br>
reference count is decremented by 1.
</p>
<p>
When all clients have released their references to an object, the reference count of the<br>
object is 0, and at this point the draft can delete the object to regain the memory it<br>
occupies. However, deletion may not be immediate when the object's reference count<br>
drops to 0. In actuality, object deletion is deferred until the purge mechanism of the<br>
draft is triggered. Typically, a purge is initiated by the storage system (for example,<br>
during a save operation) or by the document shell (such as when the document shell<br>
realizes that memory is running low).
</p>
<p>
In response to a purge request, the draft deletes all the persistent objects and storage<br>
units that aren't in use -- that is, objects whose reference count is 0. When all the<br>
part objects belonging to a certain part editor are deleted, SOM calls the Code Fragment<br>
Manager (CFM) to unload the part editor library. The CFM calls the CFMTerminate<br>
routine of the part editor library, and both the code and data sections of the library are<br>
destroyed. Some details of how the library is unloaded depend on the kind of SOM class<br>
it contains -- either static or dynamic.
</p>
<p>
Objects created using new className and SOM kernel services (somNewObject,<br>
somNewClassReference, and SOMobject::somGetClass) are static class objects. Most (if<br>
not all) objects created by a part editor fall into this category. A static class is<br>
unloaded when the code that created the static class object is unloaded. Therefore, when<br>
a part editor is unloaded, all static classes in the same library are unloaded as well.<br>
Other interdependent libraries may also be unloaded; there will be more on this later.
</p>
<p>
Objects created using the runtime name or ID class-lookup services of SOM (for<br>
example, SOMClassMgr::somFindClass, somNewObjectByName, or<br>
somGetDynamicClassReference) are dynamic class objects. OpenDoc parts are dynamic<br>
class objects, since they're created by name. Extension objects are also dynamic<br>
because ODExtension is implemented as a dynamic class; subclasses of ODExtension<br>
inherit its dynamic property as long as they call the parent's InitExtension method.<br>
Other OpenDoc classes will be converted to dynamic classes as the need arises; check<br>
the notes accompanying future OpenDoc releases for a listing of these.
</p>
<p>
A dynamic class guarantees that its code and the code for its inherited classes won't be<br>
unloaded until the last object of the class is deleted. When the last instance of a part<br>
class is deleted, SOM unloads the CFM library containing the part class.
</p>
<h2>REFERENCE-COUNTING GOTCHAS</h2>
<p>
Every persistent object must have a correct reference count for the part editor<br>
unloading mechanism to work. If a part object has a reference count that's higher than<br>
the correct count, the object will remain valid throughout the session even though it's<br>
no longer being used. This object will keep its associated part editor library from<br>
being unloaded until the process quits. Conversely, if an object has a reference count<br>
that errs on the low side, the object may be deleted, causing its library to be unloaded.<br>
Referencing an invalid object pointer usually results in a crash.
</p>
<p>
The best way to avoid reference-count errors is to familiarize yourself with OpenDoc<br>
persistent objects and follow the recipes outlined in the OpenDoc Programmer's Guide<br>
for the Mac OS. Be sure to pay special attention to the following potential trouble spots.
</p>
<p>
<b>Avoid self-referencing</b>. If a part object keeps a reference to itself, its reference<br>
count will be at least 1 and its part editor library won't be unloaded until the session<br>
ends. Since a reference to the part is passed in as an argument in every ODPart<br>
method, a part shouldn't need to store a reference to itself.
</p>
<p>
<b>Break circular references between parts and frames.</b> Each display frame<br>
has a reference to its part (after the part has been internalized). Even though a part<br>
isn't required to keep a reference to its display frames, most parts do so for<br>
convenience. This creates a circular reference between a part and its display frames,<br>
so the reference count alone won't indicate when deleting a part is appropriate. The<br>
situation becomes more complicated when the part has embedded frames and also keeps<br>
references to them. To break these circular references, OpenDoc offers the Close and<br>
Remove protocols.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Close protocol is triggered when a containing part decides to<br>
get rid of its runtime-embedded frame objects. The containing part calls the<br>
embedded frame's Close method. The frame first calls its part's<br>
DisplayFrameClosed method, which should release its reference to the display<br>
frame and close its embedded frames (if any) before releasing its reference to<br>
the part.</li>
<li>The Remove protocol works similarly to the Close protocol.<br>
However, the protocol is triggered when a containing part decides to remove<br>
its embedded frames from both runtime storage and persistent storage. The<br>
Remove protocol is propagated through the ODPart::DisplayFrameRemoved and<br>
ODFrame::Remove methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Unregister frames and parts when idle time is no longer needed.</b> When a<br>
part registers its frame with the OpenDoc dispatcher for idle time, the dispatcher<br>
retains a reference to the frame. Until the part editor unregisters the frame object<br>
from the dispatcher, the object will remain resident in memory with a reference<br>
count greater than 0. This will prevent the object from being deleted and its library<br>
from being unloaded. The part editor should unregister the frame when the Remove or<br>
Close protocol is triggered.
</p>
<p>
On rare occasions, a part may have a display frame that's not in the frame hierarchy<br>
originated from the root frame. For example, a part may have some frames stored for<br>
the View in Window command. Don't internalize those frames and register them for<br>
idle time until the frames are actually used.
</p>
<p>
A part may also register itself with the OpenDoc dispatcher for idle time. As in the case<br>
of registered frames, the dispatcher retains a reference to the part object. To ensure<br>
that the object is deleted and that its library is unloaded at the earliest possible time,<br>
the part editor must unregister itself from the dispatcher as soon as idle time is no<br>
longer needed. This usually occurs when all the part's display frames have been closed<br>
or removed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Watch extensions for reference-counting problems.</b> OpenDoc's extension<br>
mechanism enables separate parts in a document to communicate with each other<br>
directly. By creating an associated extension object, a part editor can extend its part<br>
interface to satisfy special needs. To enable efficient communication, the extension<br>
object maintains a reference to the part object that created it; the part typically keeps<br>
a reference to the extension so that it can give out the same extension object again if<br>
it's requested.
</p>
<p>
In general, an extension object is released before its creator, thus preventing any<br>
reference-counting problem for the part. But if the reference count of the extension<br>
object isn't maintained correctly, or if the client of the extension object refuses to<br>
release it, the part object can detach the extension object from itself by calling<br>
ODExtension::BaseRemoved. A well-behaved extension object should then report errors<br>
to clients when it's being accessed. An even better idea is to avoid using the base<br>
removal mechanism and instead to define the scope and lifespan of an extension.

<h2>A LIBRARY-UNLOADING GOTCHA</h2>
<p>
When a part editor is unloaded, SOM unloads the CFM library associated with the part<br>
editor. Moreover, if there's another library in the same library closure as the part<br>
editor, the CFM will unload it if it doesn't belong to another library closure. (A<br>
library closure is a group of shared libraries whose interdependencies cause them to<br>
be loaded together by the CFM.) This means that code other than the part editor<br>
residing in the same CFM library closure is unloaded as well. If the developer hasn't<br>
foreseen this possibility, it can lead to unfortunate consequences.
</p>
<p>
Let's consider a typical example. A part editor creates a SOM object from a static class<br>
that resides in the same library closure as the part editor. The part editor then<br>
installs the object in a name space so that others can access it. If this object doesn't<br>
hold a reference to the part, the part may be deleted (and its library closure unloaded)<br>
when the object reference is still in the name space. The next time this object is used,<br>
a crash will likely occur because the code associated with the object has been unloaded<br>
with the part editor.
</p>
<p>
To prevent this from happening, you should ensure that no class whose code resides in<br>
the same library closure as the part editor outlives the part itself. If an object must<br>
outlive the part that creates it, the object should be created dynamically. OpenDoc<br>
provides a utility function, ODNewObject, to create objects by name. The code in<br>
Listing 1 illustrates how a dynamic object is created with ODNewObject.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1.</b> Creating a dynamic object with ODNewObject
</p>
<pre>#include "ODNewObj.h"

ODObjectNameSpace* objNameSpace =
    (ODObjectNameSpace*) nameSpMgr-&gt;CreateNameSpace
        (ev, kOSAScriptingTool, kODNULL, 1, kODNSDataTypeODObject);
Sample_ScriptRunnerAgent* agent =
    (Sample_ScriptRunnerAgent*) ODNewObject
        ("Sample::ScriptRunnerAgent");
objNameSpace-&gt;Register(ev, kOSAScriptingTool, agent);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
______________________________
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, parts and extensions are dynamic objects and thus don't require<br>
ODNewObject. ODNewObject is used mainly on SOM classes that a part developer has<br>
created.
</p>
<p>
Once a class has been accessed dynamically, the class remains dynamic until the<br>
process exits or the use count of the class maintained by SOM goes to 0. Until then, all<br>
object references created for the class are considered dynamic by SOM.
</p>
<h2>COUNTING ON YOU</h2>
<p>
Part editor unloading in OpenDoc is a great scheme for managing memory efficiently.<br>
But its success depends on the cooperation of each and every part editor. If you keep in<br>
mind the gotchas detailed in this column, your part editor will avoid the pitfalls and<br>
reap the benefits of wise resource use.
