<h2>ATTACHING VS. EMBEDDING</h2>
<p>
The term <i>attach</i> has been used to refer to both attaching and embedding. Allow me to set<br>
the record straight by offering definitions of the two terms as they apply to scripting.
</p>
<ul>
<li>An <i>attached</i> script is a compiled script or script application that's<br>
associated with a menu item in an application; the script is executed when the<br>
user chooses that command. This type of script usually resides in a particular<br>
place, such as a Scripts folder. Script attachment can be implemented quickly<br>
and, at its most basic level, doesn't require your application to be scriptable.</li>
<li>An <i>embedded</i> script is a compiled script that's associated with an interface<br>
element belonging to an application or with a document. The script can be<br>
stored with the application's data, often in a special file known to the<br>
application, or embedded within the data for a document file.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ATTACHING SCRIPTS TO MENU ITEMS</h2>
<p>
Attached scripts are useful for two reasons. You, or your users (depending on what's<br>
appropriate for your application), can do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Execute scripts to communicate with and control other scriptable<br>
applications without leaving your application. This is useful whether or not<br>
your application is scriptable.</li>
<li>Use scripts as an means of extending the functions or options available in<br>
your application. If your application itself is scriptable, script attachment<br>
leverages off the work you've already done.</li>
</ul>
<p>
By allowing users to keep a menu of their favorite scripts, you enable them to build a<br>
library of expanded functionality for your application. The Mac OS and Finder<br>
accomplish this with the Automated Tasks submenu in the Apple menu. You can do this<br>
with a Scripts menu that appears as the last (or next to last) of your application's<br>
menus.
</p>
<p>
Here are the steps for implementing this attachable behavior:
</p>
<ul>
<li>In the resource file included with your application, include a menu<br>
resource with the title "Scripts."</li>
<li> In the startup code for your application, locate the Scripts folder in your<br>
application's folder, creating it if it isn't there.</li>
<li> Walk the files in the Scripts folder, checking for compiled scripts (file<br>
type 'osas') and script applications (file type 'APPL', creator 'aplt' or 'dplt').<br>
Add the names of these files to your Scripts menu.</li>
<li> When a user selects a script name from the Scripts menu, load the script<br>
resource ('scpt' 128) and execute the script, as shown in Listing 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>

VAR
   fileSpec:             FSSpec;
   scriptRes:            Handle;
   scriptDesc:           AEDesc;
   scriptID, resultID:   OSAID;
   myErr, ignoredErr:    OSAError;
   savedRes, refNum:     Integer;
   specChanged:          Boolean;

BEGIN
   (* Get the file specification corresponding to the menu item
chosen. *)
   myErr := ResolveAlias(NIL, theAlias, fileSpec, specChanged);
   IF myErr &lt;&gt; noErr THEN MyErrorProc(myErr);

   (* Open the resource fork and grab the script resource. *)
   savedRes := CurResFile;
   refNum := FSpOpenResFile(fileSpec, fsRdPerm);
   IF refNum = -1 THEN MyErrorProc(-1);
   UseResFile(refNum);
   scriptRes := Get1Resource(kOSAScriptResourceType, 128);
   IF ResError &lt;&gt; noErr THEN MyErrorProc(ResError);

   (* Prepare and run the script. *)
   myErr := AECreateDesc(typeOSAGenericStorage, scriptRes^,
GetHandleSize(scriptRes),       scriptDesc);
   IF myErr &lt;&gt; noErr THEN MyErrorProc(myErr);
   myErr := OSALoad(gGenericComponent, scriptDesc, kOSAModeNull,
scriptID);
   IF myErr &lt;&gt; noErr THEN MyErrorProc(myErr);
   myErr := OSAExecute(gGenericComponent, scriptID, kOSANullScript,
kOSAModeNull, resultID);
   ignoredErr := OSADispose(gGenericComponent, scriptID);
   ignoredErr := AEDisposeDesc(scriptDesc);
   IF myErr &lt;&gt; noErr THEN MyErrorProc(myErr);

   (* Finish up. *)
   ReleaseResource(scriptRes);
   CloseResFile(refNum);
   UseResFile(savedRes);

   (* You might want to do something with the result. *)
   IF resultID &lt;&gt; kOSANullScript THEN MyDealWithResult(resultID);
   RunAttachedScript := myErr;
END;</pre>

<p>
Before executing a script, you must establish a connection to a scripting component.<br>
The easiest thing to do is to connect to the generic scripting component with<br>
OpenDefaultComponent. When you're done, disconnect from the component with<br>
CloseComponent. Depending on how you design your application, you can open this<br>
connection and keep it open while your program is running, or you can open and close<br>
the connection each time you load and execute a script. For more information on<br>
choosing and connecting scripting components, see <i>Inside Macintosh: Interapplication</i><br>
<i>Communication</i>, Chapter 10.
</p>
<h2>EMBEDDED SCRIPTS IN APPLICATION DATA OR DOCUMENT<br>
FILES</h2>
<p>
Embedded scripts can be used in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Interface elements belonging to an application, such as tool palette icons,<br>
menu items, and buttons, can have scripts associated with them.</li>
<li>Scripts can be associated with individual documents. Unlike the above<br>
case, you can trigger the script with any method that's appropriate for your<br>
application.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Embedding scripts can be extremely powerful. For example, you can associate scripts<br>
with elements of a form to supply a field's editing rules, or with a button to perform<br>
calculations. Replace a script and you change the rules or the formula! Depending on<br>
your particular application, you can use this technique yourself or allow users to do<br>
their own replacement.
</p>
<p>
If you reserve this technique for your own use, you can revise your software simply<br>
by replacing scripts with corrected or enhanced versions. Or, if you allow your users<br>
to change the embedded scripts, your application becomes easily customizable: users<br>
can modify or augment your application's capabilities simply by substituting scripts.<br>
You could even ship your application with replacement scripts, which users can<br>
substitute for default scripts that you provide.
</p>
<h2>RETRIEVING EMBEDDED SCRIPTS</h2>
<p>
There are three methods of retrieving embedded scripts from files, depending on<br>
where they're stored. Regardless of which method you choose, it's important to<br>
remember that your program should never try to interpret the bytes of a compiled<br>
script. However, as long as you keep the bytes intact, you can do whatever you want<br>
with them and the script will remain intact.
</p>
<p>
<b>Aliases to script files.</b> This is the same technique as described above for attached<br>
scripts. This method is used primarily for maintaining a list of scripts. You'd use it,<br>
for instance, if you kept a collection of scripts in a folder on disk. I don't recommend<br>
this technique if the scripts are associated with actual interface elements, because the<br>
links that aliases provide to the script files can too easily be broken.
</p>
<p>
<b>In the document's resource fork.</b> Storing the scripts as resources is convenient<br>
because you can easily use your favorite resource editor to copy a script resource<br>
from a compiled script or script application and paste it into the special application<br>
file or the document. It also makes it easy to grab the scripts for loading and executing,<br>
using the method shown in Listing 1 (though in this situation I'd suggest using an ID<br>
number other than 128 for the script resource). The drawback is that your users can<br>
get their hands on the script with <i>their</i> favorite resource editor.
</p>
<p>
<b>In the document's data fork.</b> Maintaining the scripts within the data for a<br>
document is a more secure method, since it makes it harder for users to extract the<br>
scripts. It's also more difficult for you, though, because you may have to keep track of<br>
the location within the document's data, and then convert the script into the form<br>
required for execution. You'll want to store three pieces of information: the<br>
four-character ID 'scpt' (typeOSAGenericStorage), the length of the script data that<br>
follows, and the script data itself. The ID isn't essential, but it may come in handy,<br>
especially if there are other types of data present or if you load your document's data<br>
sequentially.
</p>
<p>
There are many ways to keep track of multiple types of data in a document file. If you<br>
have a lot of different types of data in the file, you can even develop a small database<br>
for the data, complete with a directory, so that you can gain quick access to particular<br>
types of data, including the script. A simpler way is to maintain the data in one long<br>
stream, embedding the script data within the stream. If you know the location of the<br>
script within the stream, you can just load and execute it when a user wants to run it.<br>
One developer I know reads all the data in the data fork (including scripts)<br>
sequentially when the file is opened, so that he doesn't need to keep track of the script's<br>
location within the file. Listing 2 shows an example of loading script data from the data<br>
fork of a document file.
</p>

<h2>GIVING IT AWAY</h2>
<p>
The information in this column is not offered as a complete solution, but is intended to<br>
get you moving with implementing attachability. There are many other issues<br>
surrounding attachability that are worth exploring, such as getting time during script<br>
execution, using attached scripts to allow users to tinker with some of the core<br>
functionality of your application, and providing a consistent way for your users to edit<br>
attached and embedded scripts. I plan to delve into these other issues in upcoming<br>
columns.
</p>
<p>
Making your application capable of attaching or embedding scripts puts new power into<br>
your users' hands, giving them unprecedented ability to develop custom solutions to<br>
their problems. It's not hard to do, and the benefits are enormous. Do it today.

<b>CAL SIMONE</b> (mainevent@his.com, AppleLink MAIN.EVENT)&nbsp;&nbsp;Few people know it, but<br>
before Cal was in the software business, he used to produce records (the musical kind)<br>
in Washington DC and New York. At a time when computers were used mostly to make<br>
robotic dance music, Cal was one of the first to painstakingly create "human"<br>
performances in pop records with about 60 MIDI synthesizers and, of course, a<br>
Macintosh. He now works toward a day when every application will be scriptable.*
