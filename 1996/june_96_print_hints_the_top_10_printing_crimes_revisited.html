<i style="font-size:125%;">They say some things never change. Although it's been four years</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">since Pete "Luke" Alexander wrote about the top 10 printing crimes</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">in develop, people are still committing some of the same crimes.</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">There are also a few new crimes to add to the list. So, here they</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">are, the updated top 10 printing crimes (ordered on a combined</i>
<br>

<i style="font-size:125%;">frequency and hideousness scale):</i>
</p>
<ol start="10" reversed="true">
<li>Having insufficient free memory at print time.</li>
<li>Coloring outside the lines.</li>
<li>Misusing the PostScriptHandle picture comment.</li>
<li>Calling PrintDefault or PrValidate before PrOpen.</li>
<li>Avoiding the print dialogs, especially PrJobDialog.</li>
<li>Accessing undocumented fields in the print record.</li>
<li>Not checking error return values.</li>
<li>Making low-level Printing Manager calls.</li>
<li>Not using QuickDraw GX print dialogs if QuickDraw GX is present.</li>
<li>Adding printing to your application last.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Now let's look at how to avoid these crimes. The solutions are relatively easy.
</p>
<h2>SOLVING THE PRINTING CRIMES</h2>
<p><b style="display: inline-block; width:30px"><i>10.</i></b><b><i>Having insufficient free memory at print time.</i></b></p>
<p>
Some printer drivers use a lot of memory. When a driver runs out of memory, the<br>
results are usually pretty bad, so you should give printer drivers as much memory as<br>
possible. Unfortunately, memory requirements vary from driver to driver, so it's<br>
hard to predict how much memory a driver will need.
</p>
<p>
<i>Solution:</i> Unload all unneeded code and resources before printing.
</p>
<p><b style="display: inline-block; width:30px"><i>9.</i></b><b><i>Coloring outside the lines.</i></b></p>
<p>
Many applications draw outside the printable area of the page when printing. This can<br>
happen if the user has extended objects beyond the printable area. Drawing unneeded<br>
objects causes extra work for the driver and the printer, which affects performance.<br>
In some cases, the driver also needs to allocate extra memory to hold the objects or the<br>
enclosing rectangle.
</p>
<p>
<i>Solution:</i> Draw only the portions of objects that will appear on the page. This can be<br>
determined by looking at the rPage field in the printer information record (which is<br>
in the prInfo field of the print record).
</p>
<p><b style="display: inline-block; width:30px"><i>8.</i></b><b><i>Misusing the PostScriptHandle picture comment.</i></b></p>
<p>
The PostScriptHandle picture comment is designed to add PostScript (TM) code to a<br>
page containing QuickDraw graphics. It's not designed to send multiple pages of<br>
pre-generated PostScript code to a printer (for that, you need to use the<br>
Pap.WorkStation.o library).
</p>
<p>
<i>Solution:</i> Use the PostScriptHandle picture comment only to draw a self-contained<br>
image, which will be added to any QuickDraw graphics already on the page. If the<br>
PostScript code needs to change the graphics state, it should save and restore the state.<br>
Think of the picture comment as a way to include an EPS image, with all the<br>
restrictions placed on EPS by Adobe (TM) (as specified in Appendix H of the<br>
<i>PostScript Language Reference Manual,</i> second edition). The PostScript code should be<br>
compatible with both Level 1 and Level 2 PostScript, and you should include a<br>
QuickDraw version of the graphic so that your users can print to a non-PostScript<br>
printer.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>For more information</i> on how to use the PostScriptHandle picture comment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see Technote 1032, "Mixing QuickDraw &amp; PostScript Printing from Your App:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Gotchas," and Appendix B of <i>Inside Macintosh: Imaging With QuickDraw</i>.*
</p>
<p><b style="display: inline-block; width:30px"><i>7.</i></b><b><i>Calling PrintDefault or PrValidate before PrOpen.</i></b></p>
<p>
The documentation for the Printing Manager (Chapter 9 of <i>Inside Macintosh: Imaging</i><br>
<i>With QuickDraw</i>) mentions that you need to call PrOpen before calling any other<br>
Printing Manager functions. Unfortunately, the descriptions for PrintDefault and<br>
PrValidate don't repeat this warning.
</p>
<p>
<i>Solution: </i>Always call PrOpen before calling any other Printing Manager calls.
</p>
<p><b style="display: inline-block; width:30px"><i>6.</i></b><b><i>Avoiding the print dialogs, especially PrJobDialog.</i></b></p>
<p>
Some applications try to avoid print dialogs because either user interaction isn't<br>
possible or the developer thinks the user will make a mistake. Because all of the many<br>
options for the current drivers, most notably LaserWriter 8, cannot be stored in the<br>
print record, you need to call PrJobDialog so that the driver can read in the options<br>
from where they're stored (usually in the preferences file). If you don't call<br>
PrJobDialog, the driver can't set up the print record correctly, and you might not get<br>
the output you expected. The solution should be to call PrJobMerge, but in many<br>
drivers PrJobMerge does a less than perfect job.
</p>
<p>
<i>Solution: </i>Call PrJobDialog before printing to set up your print record correctly, or<br>
use QuickDraw GX, which supports dialog-free printing.
</p>
<p><b style="display: inline-block; width:30px"><i>5.</i></b><b><i>Accessing undocumented fields in the print record.</i></b></p>
<p>
Many of the fields in the print record are undocumented or documented as private.<br>
Printer drivers can use these fields however they choose. What works for one driver<br>
might cause another to crash or to print zillions of pages you don't want.
</p>
<p>
<i>Solution: </i>Use only the fields in the print record that are documented as public in<br>
Chapter 9 of <i>Inside Macintosh: Imaging With QuickDraw</i>.
</p>
<p><b style="display: inline-block; width:30px"><i>4.</i></b><b><i>Not checking error return values.</i></b></p>
<p>
After any call to a Printing Manager function, you should check PrError. If you're<br>
calling PrGeneral, you should also check the iError field in the TGnlData structure. Be<br>
aware that newer drivers return errors that older drivers didn't. For example,<br>
PrStlDialog in LaserWriter 8 can return an error if the preferences file is missing or<br>
corrupted; many applications don't check for this error, and later crash when they've<br>
pushed the driver completely off the cliff.
</p>
<p>
<i>Solution: </i>Always check and handle printing errors. See the Macintosh Technical Note "A<br>
Printing Loop That Cares..." (PR 10) and the article "Meet PrGeneral" in <i>develop</i><br>
Issue 3.
</p>
<p><b style="display: inline-block; width:30px"><i>3.</i></b><b><i>Making low-level Printing Manager calls.</i></b></p>
<p>
The low-level Printing Manager routines, such as PrDrvrOpen, are obsolete and<br>
unsupported.
</p>
<p>
<i>Solution: </i>Never call the low-level routines.
</p>
<p><b style="display: inline-block; width:30px"><i>2.</i></b><b><i>Not using QuickDraw GX print dialogs if QuickDraw GX is present.</i></b></p>
<p>
When you call the classic Printing Manager functions and QuickDraw GX is active, the<br>
user gets the old-style "compatibility dialogs," which lack many of the features that<br>
are provided in the QuickDraw GX print dialogs. There are two problems with this: the<br>
user doesn't have access to all of the QuickDraw GX features; and when some<br>
applications call the QuickDraw GX print dialog functions and others don't, two very<br>
different printing experiences are presented to the user.
</p>
<p>
<i>Solution: </i>Call the QuickDraw GX print dialog functions in your print loop if QuickDraw<br>
GX is present. For help, see the article "Adding QuickDraw GX Printing to QuickDraw<br>
Applications" in <i>develop</i> Issue 19. The complete documentation can be found in <i>Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh: QuickDraw GX Printing</i>.
</p>
<p><b style="display: inline-block; width:30px"><i>1.</i></b><b><i>Adding printing to your application last.</i></b></p>
<p>
Four years later, this is still the number-one printing crime. A lot of developers<br>
leave printing until near the end of the product development cycle. When problems are<br>
encountered, Developer Technical Support gets messages like: "My application can't<br>
print, and I've <i>got</i> to ship today. Please answer as soon as possible."
</p>
<p>
<i>Solution: </i>Hook up your print loop as early as possible. As you add each new feature to<br>
your application, print a page or two. Make sure that things are still working as<br>
expected. When you take this approach, any features that cause printing problems get<br>
noticed early, and you'll have time to fix them.
</p>
<h2>A CLOSING NOTE</h2>
<p>
If you're committing any of the crimes on this list, your customers are probably<br>
seeing things they don't like when they print. This list is also far from comprehensive,<br>
as people continue to find new and unique ways to abuse the Macintosh print<br>
architecture.
</p>
<p>
Looking ahead, printing will be changing in a big way. Mac OS 8 will use QuickDraw GX<br>
as the printing model. As changes occur, there will be Technotes,<i>develop</i> articles, and<br>
other sources of information. So keep your eyes open, and remember, don't commit too<br>
many printing crimes. Crime doesn't pay.
