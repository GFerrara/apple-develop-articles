One of the beautiful things about AppleScript is that it allows you to do nearly anything<br>
you want in your vocabulary; however, just because it allows something doesn't mean<br>
that you should do it. To help guide you, I'll regularly include miscellaneous pieces of<br>
vocabulary advice in this column. This time I'll address words to avoid in your<br>
vocabulary. Here are a few examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid using <b>object</b> as the name of a class. If you must implement an<br>
abstract object class, use <b>base class</b>.</li>
<li>Avoid using the word <b>of</b> in your terms. It tends to be confusing, since it's<br>
used between parts of an object specification. It may not always possible to<br>
avoid this, but think carefully before doing it.</li>
<li>Avoid using <b>end</b> as the first word of a verb name.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Let's look more closely at the problem with using <b>end</b>. Keep in mind that users are<br>
accustomed to seeing <b>end</b> at the end of a block, and AppleScript automatically appends<br>
the word <b>tell</b>, <b>repeat</b>, <b>if</b>, or the name of the handler after the&nbsp;&nbsp;word <b>end</b> if the user<br>
types <b>end</b> on a line by itself. For example:
</p>
<pre>if the moon is blue
...
end [if] -- AppleScript fills in the "if"</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you use <b>end</b> as part of a verb name in your vocabulary, such as <b>end animation</b>,<br>
users will type the word <b>end</b> by itself and expect AppleScript to fill it in. Of course,<br>
this won't happen for a dictionary-defined command like <b>end animation</b>, which isn't<br>
a true block construct, so it will appear that the AppleScript compiler is behaving<br>
arbitrarily.
</p>
<pre>begin animation
...
end -- AppleScript doesn't fill in "animation"</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This confusion already exists in the case of the Database suite event End Transaction. In<br>
dictionaries of applications that support transactions, users find themselves having to<br>
remove the word <b>transaction</b> in the phrase <b>end transaction</b> whenever they<br>
recompile a script. Don't create this confusion in your vocabulary -- it's better to use<br>
verb names like <b>start animation</b> and <b>stop animation</b>. Users will assume that the<br>
full verb name is required.
</p>
<pre>start animation
...
stop animation</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
