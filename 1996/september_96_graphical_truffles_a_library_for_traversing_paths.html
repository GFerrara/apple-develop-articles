<p>
The QuickDraw GX graphics system is based on shape objects that are used by<br>
reference. An application creates a shape object such as a path or a polygon by passing<br>
in data that represents the geometric points of the shape to be drawn or otherwise<br>
manipulated. The QuickDraw GX graphics system then stores this information in its<br>
internal database and returns to the application a reference to the shape object. This<br>
reference is then passed to the various QuickDraw GX routines that perform operations<br>
on the shape.
</p>
<p>
Since the QuickDraw GX graphics system is maintaining the original data in its<br>
database, the application often won't keep this data around. Also, an application may not<br>
even have created the geometric points in the first place, as in the case of converting<br>
text into a path.
</p>
<p>
It's often desirable, for a variety of purposes, for an application to retrieve the<br>
geometric information from a shape object. Given the richness of geometric<br>
information that these objects can contain, it can be a nontrivial task to read back the<br>
information. This column describes a C library that any application can incorporate<br>
for the purpose of traversing the geometric information in QuickDraw GX paths.
</p>
<h2>WHAT'S IN A QUICKDRAW GX PATH OBJECT</h2>
<p>
The QuickDraw GX graphics system provides several types of graphics primitives with<br>
which to create visual content: lines, curves, polygons, paths, typography, and<br>
bitmaps. In this system, curves are quadratic B&#201;ziers that can be defined by three<br>
control points, the middle point being off the curve and the other two being on. Figure<br>
1 depicts a single quadratic curve segment.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1.</b> A QuickDraw GX quadratic curve segment
</p>
<p>
A QuickDraw GX path object is just a conglomeration of curve and line segments,<br>
resulting from an array of points. The object can contain multiple contours, each<br>
contour being a group of connected segments.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The question arises, if we look at a specific point in a path structure, whether the<br>
point is part of a line segment or part of a curve segment. The answer is that in<br>
addition to the points themselves, a path contains an array of flags, one for each point,<br>
indicating whether the point is on or off the path. To represent a single contour for a<br>
path object, QuickDraw GX uses the gxPath data structure:
</p>
<pre>struct gxPath {
   long               vectors;
   long               controlBits[1];
   struct gxPoint      vector[1];
};
typedef struct gxPath gxPath;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The vectors field is an integer that specifies the number of points in the contour, the<br>
controlBits field is a bit array representing the on-curve/off-curve flags, and the<br>
vector field is an array of points for the contour.
</p>
<p>
To represent a path object, QuickDraw GX uses the gxPaths data structure:
</p>
<pre>struct gxPaths {
   long               contours;
   struct gxPath      contour[1];
};
typedef struct gxPaths gxPaths;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The contours field is an integer specifying the number of contours, and the contour<br>
field is an array of gxPath structures, one for each contour.
</p>
<p>
Hence we have enough information to figure out what the points mean. If we see two<br>
on-path points in a row, we know that represents a line. If we see an on-path point<br>
followed by an off-path point followed by an on-path point, we know that's a quadratic<br>
curve segment.
</p>
<p>
So to read the QuickDraw GX path object to determine the actual shape, all we have to<br>
do is get a point and then get the next point. According to the previous description, it<br>
would be safe to assume that the very first point in a contour is an on-path point.<br>
Then, if the next one were also on the path, we'd have a line; if it were off, we'd know<br>
that we'd have to read a third one (which by definition would have to be on) and we'd<br>
have a curve.
</p>
<p>
The only trouble is that those assumptions aren't necessarily true. The design of<br>
QuickDraw GX could have restricted applications to using only those patterns of<br>
on-path/off-path points, disallowing two consecutive off-path points and requiring<br>
the first point and the last point in a contour to be on the path; however, it didn't.
</p>
<p>
In the interest of saving memory, QuickDraw GX allows two consecutive off-path<br>
points to imply a middle on-path point -- known as an implicit point -- exactly<br>
halfway between the off-path points. An example of this is shown in Figure 2.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
For each implicit point there's a memory savings of 8 bytes in QuickDraw GX. This<br>
allows us to define geometries in less space than would be required in other popular<br>
graphics models that use cubic B&#201;zier curves without implicit points, but it does<br>
complicate traversing the path.
</p>
<p>
QuickDraw GX also allows the first or the last point of a contour to be off the curve, in<br>
the case where the contour is closed. This further complicates path traversal.
</p>
<h2>THE SHAPEWALKER LIBRARY</h2>
<p>
You can use the ShapeWalker library (which is included on this issue's CD) to avoid<br>
having to write a huge blob of code to deal with all those points and flags discussed<br>
above. It allows an application to pass in a QuickDraw GX shape object and be sent back<br>
(via callbacks) each line and curve segment in the shape. All implicit points are<br>
resolved by the library, so the client sees only complete line or curve segments.
</p>
<p>
The header file to be used with the library defines types for four callbacks and a<br>
prototype for the ShapeWalker function:
</p>
<pre>// Function is called to move to a new point
// (start new contour).
typedef Boolean (*TpwMovetoProc)(gxPoint *p,
                  void* refcon);

// Function is called to draw a line from
// current point to p.
typedef Boolean (*TpwLinetoProc)(gxPoint *p,
                  void* refcon);

// Function is called to draw a curve from
// current point (which will be p[0]) through
// p[1] to p[2].
typedef Boolean (*TpwCurvetoProc)(gxPoint p[3],
                  void* refcon);

// Function is called to close a contour.
typedef Boolean (*TpwClosepathProc)
                  (void* refcon);

// Return result will be true if path walking
// was terminated by one of the callbacks.
Boolean ShapeWalker(gxShape theShape,
                     TpwMovetoProc DoMoveto,
                     TpwLinetoProc DoLineto,
                     TpwCurvetoProc DoCurveto,
                     TpwClosepathProc DoClosepath,
                     void* refcon);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When using the library, you provide four callbacks and a refcon. Each callback will get<br>
passed the refcon and possibly point information. It's suggested that the client maintain<br>
whatever state information is necessary for the purpose at hand. The refcon can be a<br>
pointer to a structure containing the state information. One typical component of such<br>
information that most clients would need is the notion of the current point. The<br>
current point is the piece of the path we've looked at most recently, representative of<br>
the state of processing the shape. This current point should be updated as segments<br>
come through the callbacks. (We'll see this in a moment in our sample application.)
</p>
<p>
Each callback must also return a result of type Boolean, giving the client a mechanism<br>
for causing the library to terminate traversal of the shape before completion. Return<br>
false and the shape walker will continue on to the next segment; return true and it will<br>
terminate early. This can be used to catch errors in processing the points, or to<br>
terminate processing if you've finished with the shape before the last point is reached.
</p>
<p>
The four callbacks are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>DoMoveto -- This procedure is called at the start of each new contour in<br>
the shape. It gets passed a single point and the refcon. The point identifies the<br>
location of the beginning of the contour. If the client is maintaining a current<br>
point via the refcon, it should be updated to the point passed in.</li>
<li>DoLineto -- This procedure is called for each line segment in the contour.<br>
It gets passed a single point and the refcon. The point represents the end point<br>
of the line segment. The start point of the line segment is whatever point we<br>
last saw; that will be the current point if one is being maintained. If the client<br>
is maintaining a current point via the refcon, it should be updated to the point<br>
passed in.</li>
<li>DoCurveto -- This procedure is called for each quadratic curve segment<br>
in the contour. It gets passed an array of three points and the refcon. The three<br>
points correspond to the control points of the curve. The first point in the<br>
array will be the current point if one is being maintained. The current point<br>
should then be updated to reflect the third point in the array.</li>
<li>DoClosepath -- This procedure is called at the end of every contour if the<br>
QuickDraw GX shape is closed (has the gxClosedFrameFill shape fill<br>
attribute). Closing a contour implies connecting the last point in the contour<br>
(whatever the current point is when this function is called) with the first<br>
point in the contour (the point passed into the DoMoveto function).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The code shown in Listing 1 is a sample application (SamplePathWalker.c) that<br>
converts a piece of text to a path and then uses the ShapeWalker library to read the<br>
points from the result. In this example the callback procedures are used only to print<br>
out the points in the segments, but of course they can be used to do a lot of other things<br>
as well.

<h2>WALKING THE PATH</h2>
<p>
The files PathWalking.h and PathWalking.c are all that are required to use the<br>
ShapeWalker library in your application (for the sake of brevity, PathWalking.c isn't<br>
shown in this column). This library should make it easy for your application to<br>
process QuickDraw GX path objects. For completeness, the library will also process<br>
curve objects, line objects, rectangle objects, and polygon objects in a similar<br>
manner. All other shape types will result in the posting of the<br>
"illegal_type_for_shape" graphics error. (Graphics errors can be polled with the<br>
GXGetGraphicsError function.) The ShapeWalker library is actually based on the same<br>
code used by QuickDraw GX in its built-in GX-to-PostScript translator for printing.<br>
The library's versatility means that its uses in your application are limited only by<br>
your imagination, so get creative and try it out!
