<i>QuickDraw 3D supports a mathematical model for arbitrary curves and surfaces</i><br>
<i>known as NURB (nonuniform rational B-splines). NURB curves are flexible and</i><br>
<i>powerful, but using them effectively requires some understanding of the underlying</i><br>
<i>mathematical theory. This article presents an intuitive introduction to the</i><br>
<i>mathematical concepts of the NURB model and how to use them in your QuickDraw 3D</i><br>
<i>programs.</i>
</p>
<p>
One of the more powerful features of QuickDraw 3D is its ability to work with curves<br>
and surfaces of arbitrary shape. The mathematical model it uses to represent them is<br>
known as <i>NURB</i>, for <b>n</b>on<b>u</b>niform <b>r</b>ational <b>B</b>-splines. The NURB model is flexible and<br>
powerful, but for those unfamiliar with the mathematics, it can appear dauntingly<br>
complex. The existing books and articles on the subject tend to be rigorous, lengthy,<br>
and theoretical, and often seem to require that you already understand the subject in<br>
order to follow the explanations.
</p>
<p>
The mathematics really aren't so frightening, though, once you understand them. The<br>
aim of this article is to give you an intuitive understanding of how NURBcurves work.<br>
Later in the article, we'll look at some code to show you how you can start using NURB<br>
curves in your own programs -- but you really do need to understand the theory<br>
before you can start putting it to practical use. So please be patient while we slog<br>
through the mathematical concepts: I promise we'll get around to some actual<br>
programming before we're through. Note also that this article is only about NURB<br>
<i>curves</i>; perhaps a future article will cover NURB <i>surfaces</i> and how to use curves and<br>
surfaces together.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some writers also use </b>the s from "spline," resulting in the acronym<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NURBS -- but most avoid this usage because phrases like "a NURBS curve"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sound awkward, and "a NURBS surface" sounds perfectly hideous.*
</p>
<h2>WHY NURB CURVES?</h2>
<p>
Like any graphics package, QuickDraw 3D offers low-level geometric primitives for<br>
objects such as lines, points, and triangles. Because the representations of these<br>
objects are mathematically exact -- lines being defined by their two endpoints,<br>
triangles by their three vertices, and so forth -- they're resolution independent and<br>
unaffected by changes in position, scale, or orientation.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The low-level primitives can also be used to define arbitrarily shaped objects, such<br>
as a football or an automobile hood, but at the cost of these desirable mathematical<br>
properties; for example, a circle that's approximated by a sequence of line segments<br>
will change its shape when rotated. One of the advantages of NURB curves is that they<br>
offer a way to represent arbitrary shapes while maintaining mathematical exactness<br>
and resolution independence. Among their useful properties are the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>They can represent virtually any desired shape, from points, straight<br>
lines, and polylines to conic sections (circles, ellipses, parabolas, and<br>
hyperbolas) to free-form curves with arbitrary shapes.</li>
<li>They give you great control over the shape of a curve. A set of <i>control</i><br>
<i>points </i>and <i>knots</i>, which guide the curve's shape, can be directly manipulated to<br>
control its smoothness and curvature.</li>
<li>They can represent very complex shapes with remarkably little data. For<br>
instance, approximating a circle three feet across with a sequence of line<br>
segments would require tens of thousands of segments to make it look like a<br>
circle instead of a polygon. Defining the same circle with a NURB<br>
representation takes only seven control points!</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to drawing NURB curves directly as graphical items, you can use them in<br>
various other ways that exploit their useful mathematical properties, such as for<br>
guiding animation paths or for interpolating or approximating data. You can also use<br>
them as a tool to design and control the shapes of three-dimensional surfaces, for<br>
purposes such as
</p>
<ul>
<li>surfaces of revolution (rotating a two-dimensional curve around an axis<br>
in three-dimensional space)</li>
<li>extruding (translating a curve along a curved path)</li>
<li>trimming (cutting away part of a NURB surface, using NURB curves to<br>
specify the cut)</li>
</ul>
<h2>CURVES 101</h2>
<p>
Before we go into the specifics of NURB curves, let's review some of the basics of<br>
curve representation in general.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although QuickDraw 3D supports three-dimensional NURB curves, we'll limit all of<br>
our examples and discussions here to two dimensions. But everything we say about<br>
two-dimensional curves applies in three dimensions as well -- the two-dimensional<br>
versions are just easier to visualize and easier to draw.
</p>
<p>
<b>A BIT OF HISTORY</b>
</p>
<p>
Back in the days before computers, architects, engineers, and artists would draw their<br>
designs for buildings, roads, machine parts, and the like by using pencil, paper, and<br>
various drafting tools. These tools included rulers and T-squares for drawing straight<br>
lines, compasses for drawing circles and circular arcs, and triangles and protractors<br>
for making precise angles.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, a lot of interesting-shaped objects couldn't be drawn with just these<br>
simple tools, because they had curved parts that weren't just circles or ellipses.<br>
Often, a curve was needed that went smoothly through a number of predetermined<br>
points. This problem was particularly acute in shipbuilding: although a skilled artist<br>
or draftsman could reliably hand-draw such curves on a drafting table, shipbuilders<br>
often needed to make life-size (or nearly life-size) drawings, where the sheer size of<br>
the required curves made hand drawing impossible. Because of their great size, such<br>
drawings were often done in the loft area of a large building, by a specialist known as a<br>
loftsman. To aid in the task, the loftsman would employ long, thin, flexible strips of<br>
wood, plastic, or metal, called splines. The splines were held in place with lead<br>
weights, called <i>ducks</i> because of their resemblance to the feathered creature of the<br>
same name (see Figure 1).
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1. </b>A draftsman's spline
</p>
<p>
The resulting curves were smooth, and varied in curvature depending on the position<br>
of the ducks. As computers were introduced into the design process, the physical<br>
properties of such splines were investigated so that they could be modeled<br>
mathematically on the computer.
</p>
<p>
<b>DIRECT FUNCTIONS</b>
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to represent curves in a mathematically precise fashion. One simple way is<br>
to think of the curve as the graph of a function:
</p>
<p>
<math><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></math>
</p>
<p>
Take a simple one like the trigonometric sine function:
</p>
<p>
<math><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>sin</mi><mi>x</mi></math>
</p>
<p>
By plotting the value of the function for various values of x and connecting them<br>
smoothly, we obtain the curve shown in Figure 2.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/152.gif" width="378 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2.</b> Plot of sine function values
</p>
<p>
In the case of curves drawn by the spline method, it turned out that with some<br>
reasonable simplifying assumptions, they could be mathematically represented by a<br>
series of cubic (third-degree) polynomials, each having the form
</p>
<p>
<math><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>&it;</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>&it;</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>&it;</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>D</mi></math>
</p>
<p>
At this point, the standard references typically go into a long, involved development of<br>
this idea into what are known as <i>cubic spline curves</i>, eventually leading to the theory<br>
of NURB curves. Such explanations are interesting, but not terribly intuitive. If<br>
you're interested in pursuing this subject further, you'll find a good discussion in<br>
<i>Mathematical Elements for Computer Graphics</i>. (Complete information on this and<br>
other literature references in this article can be found in the bibliography at the end.)
</p>
<p>
<b>PARAMETRIC FUNCTIONS</b>
</p>
<p>
Using direct functions to represent a curve fits our criterion of being mathematically<br>
exact, but it has one serious drawback: since we can have only one value of <i>y</i> for each<br>
value of <i>x</i>, our curves can't loop back on themselves. Thus, although we can make some<br>
nice smooth curves this way, there are a lot of interesting curves we <i>can't</i> make --<br>
not even something as simple as a circle.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An alternative method, and the one we'll be using, is to define the curve with a<br>
<i>parametric function</i>. In general, such functions have the form
</p>
<p>
<math><mi>Q</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>{</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>,</mo><mi>Y</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>}</mo></math>
</p>
<p>
where X(t) and Y(t) are functions of the parameter t (hence <i>parametric</i>). Given a<br>
value of t, the function X(t) gives the corresponding value of x, and Y(t) the value of y.<br>
One way to understand such functions is to imagine a particle traveling across a sheet<br>
of paper, tracing out a curve. If you think of the parameter t as representing time, the<br>
parametric function Q(t) gives the {x, y} coordinates of the particle at time t. For<br>
example, defining the functions X(t) and Y(t) as
</p>
<p>
<math><mi>X</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>cos</mi><mi>t</mi></math>
<br>

<math><mi>Y</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>sin</mi><mi>t</mi></math>
</p>
<p>
produces a circle, as you can verify by plugging in some values of t between 0 and<br>
2&pi; and plotting the results.
</p>
<p>
<b>SMOOTHNESS</b>
</p>
<p>
One very important motivation for using NURB curves is the ability to control<br>
smoothness. The NURB model allows you to define curves with no kinks or sudden<br>
changes of direction (such as an airplane-wing cross section) or with precise control<br>
over where kinks and bends occur (sharp corners of machined objects, for instance).
</p>
<p>
We all know (or think we do) what a nice, smooth curve looks like: it has no kinks or<br>
corners. If we were to sit on that moving particle as it traces out a parametric curve,<br>
we would experience a nice smooth ride with no stopping, restarting, or sudden<br>
changes in speed or direction: we wouldn't be heading north, say, and then turn<br>
completely east in an instant. This intuitive notion can be expressed in precise<br>
mathematical terms: Imagine an arrow that always points in the direction in which our<br>
hypothetical particle is traveling as it moves along the curve. Mathematically, the<br>
direction arrow corresponds to the tangent of the curve, which can be computed as the<br>
derivative of the curve's defining function with respect to the time parameter <i>t</i>:
</p>
<p>
<math><mi>Q</mi><mo>'</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></math>
</p>
<p>
In Figure 3, for example, the point on the curve corresponding to time <math><msub><mi>t</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>A</mi></mpadded></msub></math> is labeled as<br>
<math><mi>Q</mi><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>A</mi></mpadded></msub><mo>)</mo></math>, and the direction vector (tangent) at that point as <math><mi>Q</mi><mo>'</mo><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>A</mi></mpadded></msub><mo>)</mo></math>. If the tangent doesn't<br>
jump suddenly from one direction to another, the curve's function is said to have<br>
<i>first-derivative continuity</i>, denoted by <math><msup><mi>C</mi><mpadded voffset="-0.5em"><mn>1</mn></mpadded></msup></math>: this corresponds to our intuitive notion of<br>
smoothness.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/153.gif" width="402 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3.</b> Tangent (derivative) of a curve
</p>
<p>
Now look at the point marked <math><mi>Q</mi><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>B</mi></mpadded></msub><mo>)</mo></math>, where there's a visible kink in the curve. The<br>
direction vector just a tiny bit to the left of that point, <math><mi>Q</mi><mo>'</mo><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>B</mi></mpadded></msub><mo>-</mo><mi>&alpha;</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></math>, is wildly<br>
different from the one just a tiny bit to the right, <math><mi>Q</mi><mo>'</mo><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>B</mi></mpadded></msub><mo>+</mo><mi>&alpha;</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></math>. In fact, the<br>
direction vector jumps instantaneously from one direction to another at point <math><mi>Q</mi><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>B</mi></mpadded></msub><mo>)</mo></math>.<br>
Mathematically, this is called a<i>discontinuity</i>.
</p>
<p>
Many of you will recall from your college calculus that the derivative of a function is<br>
also a function, whose degree is one less than that of the original function. For<br>
example, the derivative of a fourth-degree function is a third-degree function. The<br>
derivative of the derivative, called the second derivative, will then be of degree 2. This<br>
second derivative may or may not be continuous: if it is, we say that the original<br>
function has <i>second-derivative continuity,</i> or <math><msup><mi>C</mi><mpadded voffset="-0.5em"><mn>2</mn></mpadded></msup></math>. As the first derivative describes the<br>
direction of the curve, the second derivative describes how fast that direction is<br>
changing. The second derivative thus characterizes the curve's degree of curvature,<br>
and so a <math><msup><mi>C</mi><mpadded voffset="-0.5em"><mn>2</mn></mpadded></msup></math>-continuous curve is said to have <i>curvature continuity</i>. We'll come back to<br>
these important concepts after we've introduced NURB curves themselves.
</p>
<h2>NURB CURVES</h2>
<p>
Now that we know how parametric functions work, let's see how we can use them to<br>
build up a definition for NURB curves. If we call our function Q, the left side of our<br>
equation will look like this:
</p>
<p>
<math><mi>Q</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo></math>
</p>
<p>
where t is a parameter representing time. By evaluating this function at a number of<br>
values of t, we'll get a series of {x, y} pairs that we can use to plot our curve, as<br>
shown in Figure 4. Now all we have to do is define the right-hand side.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>CONTROL POINTS</b>
</p>
<p>
One of the key characteristics of NURB curves is that their shape is determined by<br>
(among other things) the positions of a set of points called <i>control points</i>, like the ones<br>
labeled <math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>i</mi></mpadded></msub></math> in Figure 5. As in the figure, the control points are often joined with<br>
connecting lines to make them easier to see and to clarify their relationship to the<br>
curve. These connecting lines form what's known as a<i>control polygon</i>. (It would<br>
actually make more sense to call it a "control polyline," but the other is the<br>
conventional term.)
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/155.gif" width="600 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 5. </b>Defining a curve with control points
</p>
<p>
The second curve in Figure 5 is the same curve, but with one of the control points<br>
(<math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>7</mi></mpadded></msub></math>) moved a bit. Notice that the curve's shape isn't changed throughout its entire<br>
length, but only in a small neighborhood near the changed control point. This is a very<br>
desirable property, since it allows us to make localized changes by moving individual<br>
control points, without affecting the overall shape of the curve. Each control point<br>
influences the part of the curve nearest to it but has little or no effect on parts of the<br>
curve that are farther away.
</p>
<p>
One way to think about this is to consider how much influence each of the control<br>
points has over the path of our moving particle at each instant of time. At any time t,<br>
the particle's position will be a weighted average of all the control points, but with the<br>
points closer to the particle carrying more weight than those farther away. We can<br>
express this intuitive notion mathematically this way:
</p>

In other words, to find the position of the moving particle at a particular time, add up<br>
the positions of all the control points (<math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>i</mi></mpadded></msub></math>) but vary the strength of each point's<br>
contribution over time (<math><msub><mi>N</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>i</mi></mpadded></msub><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></math>). We'll explain the meaning of the subscript k<br>
shortly.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bounding volume returned by QuickDraw 3D for all other geometric<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;primitives is a volume that encloses the primitive itself. For NURB curves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;however, the returned bounding volume encloses the curve's control points,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rather than the curve itself. This is done for historical reasons, and is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normal practice in 3D graphics packages.*
</p>
<p>
<b>BASIS FUNCTIONS</b>
</p>
<p>
The function <math><msub><mi>N</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>i</mi></mpadded></msub><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></math>, which determines how strongly control point <math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>i</mi></mpadded></msub></math> influences the<br>
curve at time t, is called the basis function for that control point. In fact, the B in<br>
"B-splines" stands for "basis." The value of this function is a real number such as<br>
0.5, so that a particular point <math><mi>Q</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></math> can be defined as, say, 25% of one control point's<br>
position, plus 50% of another's, plus 25% of yet a third's. To complete our NURB<br>
equation, we have to specify the basis function for each control point.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do we go about defining the basis functions? Remember that we want each<br>
region of the NURB curve to be a <i>local</i> average of some small number of control points<br>
close to that region. When the moving particle is far away from a given control point,<br>
that control point has little influence on it; as the particle gets closer, the control<br>
point affects it more and more. Then the effect diminishes again as the particle recedes<br>
past the control point.
</p>
<p>
Up to now, we've been using the words "near" and "far" in a rather vague way, but the<br>
time has come to pin them down more rigorously. Because we've defined our curve<br>
parametrically with respect to time, we can regard what we've been calling a "part" or<br>
"region" of the curve as a portion of the time interval the curve covers. For example,<br>
if our curve goes from time t = 0.0 to t = 10.0, we can specify a particular region as<br>
extending from, say, t = 3.3 to t = 7.5. So we can say, for instance, that a control point<br>
Bi is centered at time t = 5.0 and has an effect in the range from t = 3.3 to t = 7.5.
</p>
<p>
Figure 6 shows a typical example of what a basis function might look like: it has its<br>
maximum effect at some definite point in time and tapers off smoothly as it gets<br>
farther away from that point. If you were awake during your college statistics course,<br>
you might recognize this as the familiar "bell curve" that we all learned to know and<br>
loathe. The curve <math><msub><mi>N</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>i</mi></mpadded></msub><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></math> in the figure shows that control point <math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>i</mi></mpadded></msub></math> has its greatest<br>
effect (about 95%) at time t = 3.0 and tapers off to about 50% at t = 1.7 and t = 4.3.

<b>Figure 6.</b> Basis function for a control point

<p>
Since each control point has its own basis function, a NURB curve with, say, five<br>
control points will have five such functions, each covering some region of the curve<br>
(that is, some interval of time). At time t = 2.3 in Figure 7, for example, control<br>
point <math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mn>0</mn></mpadded></msub></math> has a weight of about 0.2, <math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mn>1</mn></mpadded></msub></math> about 0.7, and <math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mn>2</mn></mpadded></msub></math> about 0.05. As t goes from<br>
0.0 to 7.0, each control point's effect on the shape of the curve is initially 0,<br>
increases gradually to a maximum, and then gradually tapers off again to 0 as we reach<br>
the end of its effective range.

<b>KNOTS</b>
</p>
<p>
Notice that all of the basis functions in Figure 7 have exactly the same shape and cover<br>
equal intervals of time. In general, we'd like to be able to vary the width of the<br>
intervals (so that some control points affect a larger region of the curve and others a<br>
smaller region) and the maximum height of the curves (so that some control points<br>
affect the shape of the curve more strongly than others). That's where the <i>NU</i> in <i>NURB</i><br>
comes from: it stands for <b>n</b>on<b>u</b>niform.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is to define a series of points that partition the time into intervals,<br>
which we can then use in the basis functions to achieve the desired effects. By varying<br>
the relative lengths of the intervals, we can vary the amount of time each control point<br>
affects the particle. The points demarcating the intervals are known as <i>knots</i>, and the<br>
ordered list of them is a knot vector (Figure 8). The knot vector for the basis<br>
functions shown in Figure 7 is {0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0}. This is an<br>
example of a <i>uniform knot vector,</i> which is why all the functions in the figure cover<br>
equal intervals of time. Figure 9 shows an example of a curve created with such a knot<br>
vector.

</p>
<p>
If we change the knot vector to {0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.75, 4.0, 4.25, 6.0, 7.0}, we get a set<br>
of nonuniform basis functions like the ones shown in Figure 10, and a curve that looks<br>
like Figure 11 (using the same set of control points as in Figure 9). Notice that the<br>
basis functions <math><msub><mi>N</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></mpadded></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></math> and <math><msub><mi>N</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></mpadded></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></math>, associated with control points <math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mn>2</mn></mpadded></msub></math> and <math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mn>3</mn></mpadded></msub></math>,<br>
respectively, are taller and narrower than the others. If you compare Figures 9 and<br>
11, you'll see that the curve in Figure 11 is pulled more strongly toward control<br>
points <math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mn>2</mn></mpadded></msub></math> and <math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mn>3</mn></mpadded></msub></math> than the one in Figure 9. This is because the basis functions for these<br>
control points have a greater maximum value. Also, the curve rapidly approaches<br>
these control points and rapidly moves away: compare how tightly curved it is near<br>
these points, relative to the curve in Figure 9. This is a result of the narrower basis<br>
functions for these two control points: intuitively, our moving particle has to traverse<br>
more space in relatively less time. Looking at the knot vector, you can see that the knot<br>
intervals for these two control points are narrower than the others -- {3.75, 4.0}<br>
and {4.0, 4.25} -- meaning that their effects on the curve are concentrated in shorter<br>
time intervals.

<b>DEFINING THE BASIS FUNCTIONS</b>
</p>
<p>
We're now ready to complete our definition of a NURB curve by giving an exact<br>
specification of the basis functions. In some respects, we're free to use any sort of<br>
functions we'd like, but by choosing them carefully, we can get certain desirable<br>
effects. The definitions we'll be using are as follows:

where <math><msub><mi>x</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>i</mi></mpadded></msub></math> is the conventional notation for the <i>i</i>th knot in the knot vector.
</p>
<p>
This definition has a lot of stuff in it, and lots of subscripts -- we're getting into the<br>
real theoretical aspects of NURB curves here. Notice that the functions for higher<br>
values of the subscript <i>k</i> (called the <i>order</i> of the basis function) are built up<br>
recursively from those of lower orders. If<i> k</i> is the highest order of basis function we<br>
define, the resulting NURB curve is said to be of order<i> k </i>or of <i>degree k</i>-1. At the very<br>
bottom of the hierarchy, the functions of order 1 are simply 1 if <i>t</i> is between the <i>i</i>th<br>
and (<i>i</i>+1)st knots, and 0 otherwise.
</p>
<p>
The specifics of this particular set of basis functions, and how they came to be this<br>
way, are beyond the scope of this article; if you're interested in learning more, you'll<br>
find all the detail you could possibly want (and then some) in <i>An Introduction to</i><br>
<i>Splines for Use in Computer Graphics and Geometric Modeling.</i> However, we can at<br>
least mention a number of important characteristics that this choice of basis functions<br>
exhibits:
</p>
<ul>
<li>At any time <i>t</i>, the values of all the basis functions add up to exactly 1.</li>
<li>If all control points have positive weights, the curve is contained within a<br>
bounding region known as the <i>convex hull</i>. (See the book cited above for<br>
details.)</li>
<li>At any time<i> t</i>, no more than <i>k</i> basis functions affect the curve, where <i>k</i>is<br>
the order of the curve.</li>
<li>A curve of order <i>k</i> is defined only where <i>k</i> of the basis functions are<br>
nonzero.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This last characteristic is of more than theoretical interest: a cubic (degree-3 or<br>
order-4) NURB curve with a knot vector of, say, {0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0,<br>
7.0} only goes from <i>t</i> = 3.0 to<i>t</i> = 4.0! The rule is that the curve begins at the kth knot<br>
from the beginning of the knot vector and ends at the <i>k</i>th knot from the end.
</p>
<p>
<b>KNOTS AND KINKS</b>
</p>
<p>
I should point out here that nonuniform knot vectors aren't really very useful for<br>
controlling the shape of a curve. (In fact, moving control points around directly isn't<br>
that useful, either -- but we'll get to that later.) Instead, nonuniform knot vectors<br>
have two important uses:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You've probably noticed that all of our NURB curves so far have had their<br>
endpoints just "floating in space"; that is, the curve's endpoints don't coincide<br>
with any control point. In real life, though, we generally want to be able to<br>
control the exact placement of the endpoints, and most often we want them to<br>
coincide exactly with the first and last control points.</li>
<li>You may also have noticed that the curves displayed so far are quite<br>
smooth. While this is usually a good thing, we sometimes need to create a<br>
curve with a kink or corner.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We can accomplish both of these goals by using a rather extreme case of<br>
nonuniformity: giving several consecutive knots the same value of <i>t</i>! For example, a<br>
knot vector like {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0} produces a set of basis<br>
functions like those in Figure 12 and a curve (using the same control points as before)<br>
that looks like Figure 13. Looking at Figure 12, you can see that at <i>t</i> = 0, the basis<br>
functions associated with all but the first control point have a 0 value -- so basis<br>
function <math><msub><mi>N</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></mpadded></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></math> (the one for control point <math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mn>0</mn></mpadded></msub></math>) has total control over the curve. Thus<br>
the curve at t = 0 coincides with the first control point.

<p>
If we bunch up some knots in the middle of the knot vector {0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0,<br>
5.0, 6.0, 7.0}, we get the basis functions shown in Figure 14 and the curve in Figure<br>
15. At t = 3.0, all the basis functions except <math><msub><mi>N</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></mpadded></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></math> have a 0 value -- so control<br>
point <math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mn>2</mn></mpadded></msub></math> is the only one to affect the curve at that instant, and thus the curve coincides<br>
with that control point.

<p>
In mathematical terms, continuity (smoothness) is an issue only at the joints defined<br>
by the curve's knots, where two segments of the curve meet; between the joints, the<br>
curve is perfectly smooth and continuous. A typical curve, in which each joint<br>
corresponds to a single knot, has continuity <math><msup><mi>C</mi><mpadded voffset="-0.5em"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mpadded></msup></math> where n is the degree of the curve.<br>
So a cubic (degree-3 or order-4) curve has second-derivative continuity (<math><msup><mi>C</mi><mpadded voffset="-0.5em"><mn>2</mn></mpadded></msup></math>) at<br>
each joint if all the knots are distinct. If two knots coincide, the continuity at that joint<br>
goes down by one degree; if three coincide, the continuity goes down another degree;<br>
and so on.
</p>
<p>
This means you can put a kink in the curve at a particular point by adding knots to the<br>
knot vector at that point. Later, we'll look at some code that shows how to do this. We'll<br>
also see how you can use this same technique of knot insertion to convert a curve from<br>
NURB to B&eacute;zier representation.
</p>
<p>
<b>RATIONAL CURVES</b>
</p>
<p>
Now that we've learned all about control points and knots and basis functions, we<br>
understand NUB (<b>n</b>on<b>u</b>niform <b>B</b>-spline) curves. But what about the rest of the<br>
acronym? We're still missing the <i>R</i> in <i>NURB</i>. It's time to talk about rational curves.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you've sneaked a peek at QuickDraw 3D's NURB definitions, you may have wondered<br>
why it uses a four-dimensional representation for three-dimensional control points:<br>
{x, y, z, w} instead of just {x, y, z}. The reason for the extra coordinate is that it<br>
allows us to exactly represent conic curves (circles, ellipses, parabolas, and<br>
hyperbolas), as well as giving us more control over the shape of other curves. The<br>
fourth coordinate, w, is customarily referred to as the <i>weight</i> of the control point.<br>
Ordinarily, each control point carries a weight of 1.0, meaning that they all have equal<br>
influence on the shape of the curve. Increasing the weight of an individual control point<br>
gives it more influence and has the effect of "pulling" the curve toward that point (see<br>
Figure 16).
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 16. </b>Increasing the weight of a control point
</p>
<p>
Curves that are defined in this way, with a weight w for each control point, are called<br>
<i>rational curves</i>. Mathematically, such curves are defined in four-dimensional space<br>
(since the control points have four components) and are projected down into<br>
three-dimensional space. Visualizing objects in four dimensions is a bit difficult (let<br>
alone drawing them in a diagram), but we can understand the basic idea by considering<br>
rational <i>two</i>-dimensional curves: that is, curves defined in three-dimensional space<br>
and projected onto a plane, as shown in Figure 17.

<p>
<b>Figure 17.</b> Projecting a three-dimensional curve into two dimensions
</p>
<p>
This is essentially the same process as projecting a three-dimensional model onto a<br>
two-dimensional screen with a perspective camera. The basic method for such<br>
perspective projection is to divide by the homogeneous component of the vertex (that<br>
is, w); we use an analogous approach to project our four-dimensional rational curve<br>
into three-dimensional space. Mathematically, then, we must incorporate this division<br>
into our earlier definition for a B-spline curve:

The <math><msub><mi>B</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>i</mi></mpadded></msub></math> are the projections of the four-dimensional control points and the <math><msub><mi>w</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>i</mi></mpadded></msub></math> are their<br>
weights.
</p>
<p>
There are two different conventions for representing the control points in terms of<br>
their four-dimensional coordinates {x, y, z, w}:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Homogeneous</i>, in which the coordinates represent the point's position in<br>
four-dimensional space. To project it into three dimensions, the components<br>
must all be divided through by w. Thus the point's three-dimensional position<br>
is actually {x/w, y/w, z/w}. (Note that w/w is always 1.)</li>
<li><i>Weighted Euclidean</i>, in which the coordinates are already considered to<br>
have been divided through. Thus the first three components {x, y, z} directly<br>
represent the point's position in three-dimensional space and the fourth (w)<br>
represents its weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>
QuickDraw 3D uses homogeneous representation, as do most technical papers and other<br>
graphics libraries.
</p>
<p>
<b>CONIC SECTIONS</b>
</p>
<p>
I said earlier that we could use the rational aspect of NURB curves to create conic<br>
sections (such as circles and ellipses). Conic sections are so called because they're the<br>
curves we get by intersecting a cone with a plane; the angle at which the plane<br>
intersects the cone determines whether the resulting curve is a circle, an ellipse, a<br>
parabola, or a hyperbola. Strictly speaking, hyperbolas and parabolas are of infinite<br>
extent -- but infinite curves are generally not useful in graphics applications<br>
(besides being very hard to compute a bounding box for). So we'll restrict our<br>
discussion to conic arcs.
</p>
<p>
Since conic curves are quadratic, we can represent them by quadratic (degree-2 or<br>
order-3) NURB curves. The practical question, of course, is which NURB curve.<br>
Although the proof is beyond the scope of this article, the following method (illustrated<br>
in Figure 18) can be used to generate conic arcs:
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/171.gif" width="540 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 18.</b> Constructing conic arcs
</p>
<ul>
<li>The curve is defined by three control points. The first and last are the<br>
endpoints of the conic arc, while the placement of the inner control point helps<br>
determine the shape of the curve.</li>
<li>The weights of the first and last control points are 1.0.</li>
<li> A weight less than 1.0 for the inner control point generates an ellipse; a<br>
weight equal to 1.0 generates a parabola; a weight greater than 1.0 generates a<br>
hyperbola.</li>
<li>The knot vector is {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0}.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Probably the most common form of conic arc, particularly in modeling and design<br>
applications, is a circular arc. Since a circle is simply a special case of an ellipse, the<br>
method for constructing a circular arc is a special case of the general method for<br>
elliptical arcs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The legs of the control polygon are of equal length (that is, the control<br>
triangle is isosceles).</li>
<li>The chord connecting the first and last control points meets each leg at an<br>
angle &theta; equal to half the angular extent of the desired arc (for<br>
instance, 30° for a 60° arc).</li>
<li>The weight of the inner control point is equal to the cosine of &theta;.</li>
<li>The knot vector is {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0}, just as before.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Figure 19 illustrates this construction. (In this case, the control triangle is<br>
equilateral, so the angle &theta; is 60° and the resulting arc is 120°, or<br>
one-third of a circle.)
</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 19.</b> Constructing a circular arc
</p>
<p>
Note that the foregoing method can only produce circular arcs less than 180°; for<br>
larger arcs, we have to piece together several NURB curves. So to draw a complete<br>
circle we could combine three 120° arcs, or four 90° arcs. However, it's<br>
possible to represent these three or four separate arcs as a single curve and to make a<br>
circle with only one NURB curve. Figures 20 and 21 show how to do it with three and<br>
four arcs, respectively.

<h2>NURB CURVES IN QUICKDRAW 3D</h2>
<p>
By now you're probably saying, "Enough theory already -- how does all this relate to<br>
Macintosh programming?" So let's finally look at QuickDraw 3D's data structures and<br>
routines for working with NURB curves.
</p>
<p>
<b>DATA STRUCTURES</b>
</p>
<p>
If you've been following the discussion so far, you can probably guess the contents of<br>
the data structure representing a NURB curve: the order of the curve, its control<br>
points, and its knots. There's also the usual QuickDraw 3D attribute set, so you can<br>
draw your curves in, say, fuchsia or vermilion. Here are the definitions:
</p>
<pre>typedef struct TQ3RationalPoint4D {
   float      x;
   float      y;
   float      z;
   float      w;
} TQ3RationalPoint4D;

typedef struct TQ3NURBCurveData {
    unsigned long       order;            // Order of the curve
    unsigned long       numPoints;        // Number of control points
    TQ3RationalPoint4D  *controlPoints;   // Array of control points
    float               *knots;           // Array of knots
    TQ3AttributeSet     curveAttributeSet; // QuickDraw 3D attributes
} TQ3NURBCurveData;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Most of this is pretty straightforward, but here are a few things to keep in mind:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The order of the curve must be between 2 and 16, inclusive. Order 2<br>
gives you a polyline effect; the most common orders are 3 (quadratic) and 4<br>
(cubic).</li>
<li>The control points are represented in homogeneous form, meaning that<br>
you have to divide the x, y, and z components by the w component to find the<br>
point's actual position in three-dimensional space.</li>
<li>The w component of each control point must be positive.</li>
<li>The number of control points must be equal to or greater than the order.</li>
<li>The number of knots must be equal to the number of control points plus<br>
the order of the curve.</li>
<li>The knots must be specified in nondecreasing order.</li>
<li>If k is the order of the curve, there can't be more than k-1 knots with the<br>
same value (except at the beginning or end of the sequence, where k<br>
consecutive equal knots are allowed).</li>
<li>The attribute set should contain only attributes that make sense for a<br>
curve. Most often, the attribute set will either be NULL or simply contain a<br>
color.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>RENDERING A NURB CURVE</b>
</p>
<p>
If you're familiar with QuickDraw 3D, you know that there are two ways to render a<br>
graphical entity (called a <i>geometry</i> in QuickDraw 3D terminology):<i>retained mode</i> and<br>
<i>immediate mode</i>. In retained mode, you first create an object representing the figure<br>
you want to draw, then use this <i>retained object</i> to do your drawing. (See the article<br>
"The Basics of QuickDraw 3D Geometries" in<i>develop</i> Issue 23 for more on this.)<br>
Listing 1 shows how this works for a NURB curve. First we initialize a<br>
TQ3NURBCurveData structure describing the curve to be drawn; we use this structure<br>
to create a retained object with the QuickDraw 3D function Q3NURBCurve_New, and<br>
then we pass the resulting object to Q3Geometry_Submit to render the curve. Finally,<br>
we dispose of the retained object we created.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1. </b>Rendering a NURB curve in retained mode
</p>
<pre>TQ3GeometryObject         curveObject;
TQ3NURBCurveData         curveData;

static TQ3RationalPoint4D  controlPoints[4] = {
                             { 0, 0, 0, 1 },
                             { 1, 1, 0, 1 },
                             { 2, 0, 0, 1 },
                             { 3, 1, 0, 1 }
                           };
static float               knots[8] = {
                              0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
                           };

// Initialize the data structure.
curveData.order               = 4;
curveData.numPoints           = 4;
curveData.controlPoints       = controlPoints;
curveData.knots               = knots;
curveData.curveAttributeSet   = NULL;

// Make a retained object.
curveObject = Q3NURBCurve_New(&amp;curveData);

// Use the retained object to render the curve.
Q3View_StartRendering(view);
do {
   Q3Geometry_Submit(curveObject, view);
} while (Q3View_EndRendering(view) == kQ3ViewStatusRetraverse);

// Dispose of the curve object.
Q3Object_Dispose(curveObject);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The equivalent drawing operation in immediate mode uses exactly the same code up to<br>
the point where the object is created. Instead of creating the retained object, we<br>
simply pass the TQ3NURBCurveData structure directly to the QuickDraw 3D function<br>
Q3NURBCurve_Submit to be rendered immediately:
</p>
<pre>// Render the curve directly.
Q3View_StartRendering(view);
do {
   Q3NURBCurve_Submit(&amp;curveData, view);
} while (Q3View_EndRendering(view) == kQ3ViewStatusRetraverse);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>CONTROLLING SUBDIVISION</b>
</p>
<p>
QuickDraw 3D doesn't render NURB curves directly -- as it does, say, lines or<br>
triangles. To draw a NURB curve, the renderer has to break it up into a sequence of<br>
lines or polylines. The more lines it's broken up into, the smoother it looks, but of<br>
course the longer it takes to render. Before rendering a curve, you have to tell the<br>
renderer how finely you want it subdivided.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three ways of doing this, denoted by the values of an enumerated data type:
</p>
<pre>typedef enum TQ3SubdivisionMethod {
   kQ3SubdivisionMethodConstant,
   kQ3SubdivisionMethodWorldSpace,
   kQ3SubdivisionMethodScreenSpace
} TQ3SubdivisionMethod;</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The first method, kQ3SubdivisionMethodConstant, says to subdivide the<br>
curve into a polyline with a specified number of segments between each pair of<br>
joints.</li>
<li>The second method, kQ3SubdivisionMethodWorldSpace, says to subdivide<br>
the curve so that the length of each line segment is no longer than a specified<br>
value, measured in world space.</li>
<li>The third method, kQ3SubdivisionMethodScreenSpace, is similar to the<br>
second, but the measurement is done in screen space.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following data structure specifies the subdivision method to use and the relevant<br>
parameter values:
</p>
<pre>typedef struct TQ3SubdivisionStyleData {
   TQ3SubdivisionMethod      method;
   float                     c1;
   float                     c2;
} TQ3SubdivisionStyleData;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
NURB curves use only the c1 component; the other is for NURB surfaces. A couple of<br>
things to note:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You should set both c1 and c2 to legitimate values. QuickDraw 3D doesn't<br>
know whether a curve or a surface is coming up, so it always checks both<br>
parameters for validity. If you're only drawing a curve, you may as well set<br>
c2 to the same value as c1.</li>
<li>If you specify an unreasonable value for either parameter, QuickDraw 3D<br>
will substitute a more reasonable one and issue a warning. It won't let you<br>
subdivide a curve at a million positions!</li>
<li>For method kQ3SubdivisionMethodConstant, c1 should be a whole number<br>
greater than 0; fractional values will be truncated.</li>
<li>If you don't specify a subdivision style, the default value will be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Expanding on our example of immediate mode rendering, the following code will render<br>
our NURB curve with a five-segment polyline between each pair of knots:
</p>
<pre>TQ3SubdivisionStyleData         subdivData;
...
subdivData.method = kQ3SubdivisionMethodConstant;
subdivData.c1 = subdivData.c2 = 5;
...
Q3View_StartRendering(view);
do {
   Q3SubdivisionStyle_Submit(&amp;subdivData, view);
   Q3NURBCurve_Submit(&amp;curveData, view);
} while (Q3View_EndRendering(view) == kQ3ViewStatusRetraverse);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>EDITING NURB CURVES</b>
</p>
<p>
If you're rendering your curve in immediate mode, you can edit the curve by simply<br>
modifying its control points, weights, and knot vectors directly in the<br>
TQ3NURBCurveData structure. If you're using retained mode, QuickDraw 3D provides<br>
calls to retrieve and set individual control points and knots:
</p>
<pre>TQ3Status Q3NURBCurve_GetControlPoint(TQ3GeometryObject curve,
      unsigned long pointIndex, TQ3RationalPoint4D *point4D);

TQ3Status Q3NURBCurve_SetControlPoint(TQ3GeometryObject curve,
      unsigned long pointIndex, const TQ3RationalPoint4D *point4D);
  
TQ3Status Q3NURBCurve_GetKnot(TQ3GeometryObject curve,
      unsigned long knotIndex, float *knotValue);

TQ3Status Q3NURBCurve_SetKnot(TQ3GeometryObject curve,
      unsigned long knotIndex, float knotValue);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Because we're not interacting with items that are objects themselves, there are no<br>
reference counts involved and no need to dispose of any data structures. Note, however,<br>
that if you edit a knot, the resulting knot vector must remain nondecreasing and follow<br>
the limitations described earlier for multiple knots.
</p>
<p>
You may have noticed that there are no calls to add, delete, or reorder control points or<br>
knots. Instead, QuickDraw 3D provides calls for retrieving and replacing the entire<br>
TQ3NURBCurveData structure from the retained object:
</p>
<pre>TQ3Status Q3NURBCurve_GetData(TQ3GeometryObject curve,
             TQ3NURBCurveData *nurbCurveData);

TQ3Status Q3NURBCurve_SetData(TQ3GeometryObject curve,
             const TQ3NURBCurveData *nurbCurveData);</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you want to change the number of control points and knots in a curve, you have to<br>
make a local copy of the data structure you obtain from Q3NURBCurve_GetData<br>
(making sure to allocate extra space for the new knots and control points), modify the<br>
arrays in the local copy, and store it back into the object with Q3NURBCurve_SetData.<br>
You must then call the following routine to dispose of the data you received from<br>
Q3NURBCurve_GetData:
</p>
<pre>TQ3Status Q3NURBCurve_EmptyData(TQ3NURBCurveData *nurbCurveData);</pre>
<p>
However, if you're going to be modifying the NURB curve frequently, you should<br>
probably be working in immediate mode and not using a retained object at all.
</p>
<h2>KNOT INSERTION</h2>
<p>
In general, the more control points we define for a NURB curve, the more control we<br>
have over its shape. It would seem reasonable that we could add more control points<br>
without changing the shape of the curve, and in fact this turns out to be true.<br>
Remember, though, that there's a fundamental relationship among the knots, the<br>
control points, and the order of the curve: the number of knots is equal to the number<br>
of control points plus the order. For example, a cubic curve (order 4) with 9 control<br>
points will require 13 knots. So every time we add a control point, we also have to add<br>
an extra knot -- and make sure all the control points are in the correct locations to<br>
keep the curve's shape the same as before.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, we actually take the reverse approach: we decide where to add a new knot,<br>
then compute the location of the corresponding new control point (as well as the new<br>
locations of some of the existing ones). For example, if we take the curve depicted<br>
earlier in Figure 9 and insert a new knot at t = 3.6, we get a new curve with exactly<br>
the same shape but with a new set of control points (Figure 22).

<p>
This operation of <i>knot insertion</i> is a fundamental one in working with NURB curves.<br>
It's directly useful in both modifying (editing) and rendering curves, and can also be<br>
used to convert a NURB curve to B&eacute;zier representation. After a brief discussion of the<br>
mathematical algorithm for inserting a knot, we'll look at some example C code for<br>
implementing it.

            it goes in the ordered vector of control points, but also how to adjust some of the<br>

The proof of this is relatively simple, but we don't have the time or space to go into it<br>
here. For a full discussion, see <i>Curves and Surfaces in Computer Aided Geometric</i><br>
<i>Design</i>.

<h2>THE IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
<p>
Listing 2 shows a function to implement this basic algorithm. The function, which is<br>
included on this issue's CD, accepts a QuickDraw 3D NURB-curve data structure as an<br>
argument, along with the value of the new knot to insert, and returns a new data<br>
structure representing the same curve with the new knot inserted. For brevity, the<br>
function performs no range checking on the inserted knot, but simply assumes that it<br>
falls within the legal range and that the resulting knot vector obeys the usual<br>
limitations on multiple knots. Note also that the code shown here does no checking on<br>
the results of memory allocation requests, though of course you should always perform<br>
such checks in real life.

<b>EVALUATING NURB CURVES</b>
</p>
<p>
Recall from our earlier discussion that if we have two knots at the same location, we<br>
lose one degree of continuity; with three identical knots, we lose two degrees of<br>
continuity; and so on. This process can be repeated until, when we reach k-1 identical<br>
knots (where k is the order of the curve), we have no continuity at all at the given<br>
point. In this case, the curve at that point coincides directly with a control point, as we<br>
saw in Figure 15.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We've just seen that we can add a knot xnew and calculate the new control points. If<br>
we take this "new" curve (really just the old one with more knots) and add in that<br>
same knot again and again, until we have k-1 knots in the same place, we'll end up<br>
with a control point that lies exactly at <math><mover><mi>Q</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mpadded depth="10%"><mi>new</mi></mpadded></msub><mo>)</mo></math>. We can use this technique to<br>
calculate the location of a particular point on the NURB curve: simply keep inserting<br>
knots at the point of interest until there are k-1 of them, at which time the newest<br>
control point created will lie at the desired point on the curve.
</p>
<p>
We can also use this approach to render a curve: by adding enough knots at some<br>
number of successive points in time t, we'll end up with a list of evaluated points on<br>
the curve, which we can then render as a polyline. The greater the number of<br>
evaluation points, the more segments the polyline will have, and the more closely the<br>
resulting image will approximate the curve.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>This isn't the most efficient algorithm;</b> a number of better<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternatives are available. For example, see An Introduction to <i>Splines for Use</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>in Computer Graphics and Geometric Modeling</i> for a description of the Oslo<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;algorithm, which is significantly more efficient if you're adding more than a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;few knots.*

<h2>NURB CURVES AND B&#201;ZIER CURVES</h2>
<p>
If you're familiar with B&eacute;zier curves, you may be wondering how they relate to NURB<br>
curves. In particular, if your application currently uses B&eacute;zier curves, how can you<br>
draw them when QuickDraw 3D currently only supports NURB curves? Although a<br>
thorough treatment of the subject is beyond the scope of this article, you'll be happy to<br>
learn that B&eacute;zier curves can actually be viewed as a subset of NURB curves. As a<br>
result, converting from B&eacute;zier to NURB representation turns out to be trivial.
</p>
<p>
<b>CONVERTING B&#201;ZIER TO NURB CURVES</b>
</p>
<p>
Here's all it takes to convert a B&eacute;zier curve to NURB format:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the B&eacute;zier control points as the NURB control points. If the B&eacute;zier<br>
control points are rational (that is, if they have four components {x, y, z,<br>
w}), make sure they're in homogeneous rather than weighted Euclidean form.<br>
If they're nonrational (have no w component), simply set w = 1.0 for each<br>
NURB control point.</li>
<li>Set the order of the NURB curve to the number of control points. B&eacute;zier<br>
curves typically have three or four control points, corresponding to quadratic<br>
(order-3) or cubic (order-4) NURB curves, respectively.</li>
<li>Create a knot vector with 2k elements, where k is the order of the curve.<br>
Set the first k knots to 0.0 and the last k to 1.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Listing 3 shows a function to perform the conversion (it's included on this issue's CD).<br>
The B&eacute;zier curve is assumed to be represented by a data structure of the form
</p>
<pre>typedef struct BezierCurve {
   unsigned int   order;
   Point3D         *controlPoints;
} BezierCurve;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 3.</b> Converting a B&eacute;zier curve to NURB format
</p>
<pre>TQ3NURBCurveData *BezierToNURBCurve(BezierCurve *bezCurve)
{
   TQ3NURBCurveData  *nurbCurveData; // NURB curve data structure
   unsigned long     k;              // Order of curve
   Point3D           *b;             // Bezier control point vector
   unsigned long     i;              // Control point or knot index
  
   // Set up local variables for readability.
   k = bezCurve-&gt;order;
   b = bezCurve-&gt;controlPoints;
  
   // Allocate data structure for new curve.
   nurbCurveData = malloc(sizeof(TQ3NURBCurveData));
   nurbCurveData-&gt;order = k;
   nurbCurveData-&gt;numPoints = k;
   nurbCurveData-&gt;controlPoints =
      malloc(k*sizeof(TQ3RationalPoint4D));
   nurbCurveData-&gt;knots = malloc(2*k*sizeof(float);
  
   // Create the control points.
   for (i = 0; i &lt; k; i++) {
      TQ3RationalPoint4D_Set(&amp;nurbCurveData-&gt;controlPoints[i],
                              b[i].x, b[i].y, b[i].z, 1.0);
   }
  
   // Create the knots.
   for (i = 0; i &lt; k; i++) {
      nurbCurveData-&gt;knots[i] = 0.0;
      nurbCurveData-&gt;knots[i + k] = 1.0;
   }
  
   // Set attributes here, if desired.
   nurbCurveData-&gt;nurbCurveAttributes = NULL;
  
   return (nurbCurveData);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
where the number of control points is equal to the order of the curve. The function<br>
returns a TQ3NURBCurveData structure representing the equivalent NURB curve.<br>
Once again, we've saved code space by leaving out the necessary checks on the results of<br>
memory allocation requests.
</p>
<p>
<b>CONVERTING NURB TO B&#201;ZIER CURVES</b>
</p>
<p>
Converting a NURB curve to B&eacute;zier format is more complicated than the other way<br>
around. As we've just seen, any B&eacute;zier curve can be represented by a particular type<br>
of NURB curve, having half its knots at one end and half at the other. The converse,<br>
however, isn't true: an arbitrary NURB curve can't, in general, be represented by a<br>
single B&eacute;zier curve. In fact, it generally requires several B&eacute;ziers to represent a<br>
single NURB curve: one for each distinct segment of the curve, as defined by its knot<br>
vector.
</p>
<p>
Recall that each segment of a NURB curve is affected by some subset of the control<br>
points. If we take each segment and add knots to both ends, generating a new set of<br>
control points each time, until each end has a number of knots equal to the order of the<br>
curve, the result will be a B&eacute;zier representation of that particular segment. Do this<br>
for each segment, and we'll end up with a series of B&eacute;zier curves that, taken together,<br>
look exactly like the original NURB curve.
</p>
<h2>DESIGNING WITH NURB CURVES</h2>
<p>
The topic of how to use NURB curves in design could easily fill a book; we'll have to be<br>
content with just a brief discussion, along with some pointers for further reading.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The most obvious capabilities an application program can offer for creating and<br>
modifying NURB curves are
</p>
<ul>
<li>interactive placement and movement of control points</li>
<li>interactive placement and movement of knots</li>
<li>interactive setting and modification of control-point weights</li>
</ul>
<p>
These capabilities can be moderately effective, but actually using them to model a<br>
desired shape turns out to be difficult and awkward. In addition, modifying a control<br>
point, knot, or weight will generally affect parts of the curve that the user wants to<br>
remain unchanged.
</p>
<p>
One problem that has been explored extensively is that of automatically creating a<br>
curve that goes through (interpolates) a given set of points, which may have been<br>
interactively placed by the user or perhaps obtained by some sort of data sampling.<br>
Indeed, it might be said that this was one of the original motivations for the<br>
mathematical development of spline curves. The first straightforward attempts yielded<br>
less than satisfactory results, but later efforts weren't too bad and may be useful if the<br>
curve must pass exactly through the given points. Often, however, we only need to<br>
approximate the given set of points with a spline curve. The points may have been<br>
obtained by sampling the user's freehand drawing with a mouse or tablet, or perhaps<br>
by measuring a physical object or extracting edge information from a glyph in a<br>
bitmapped font. In these cases, we probably want to preserve features such as<br>
endpoints and corners, but the remaining data samples may be noisy or nonsmooth and<br>
need not be fitted exactly. Techniques for both exact and approximate fitting can be<br>
found in <i>Phoenix: An Interactive Curve Design System Based on the Automatic Fitting of</i><br>
<i>Hand-Sketched Curves and A User Interface Model and Tools for Geometric Design.</i><br>
These techniques can also be adapted for use in modifying an existing curve, whether it<br>
was generated in the usual way or via one of these fitting algorithms.
</p>
<h2>CURVING ON</h2>
<p>
Well, there you have it: more than you probably wanted to know about NURB curves,<br>
plus some free code to boot. Look for a possible upcoming article on NURB surfaces,<br>
and how NURB curves and surfaces can be used together for designing objects and<br>
controlling motion.
