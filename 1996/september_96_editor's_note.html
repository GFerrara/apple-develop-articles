<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>

<h1>DAVE JOHNSON FOR CAROLINE ROSE</h1>
<p>
As I write this our esteemed Editor-in-Cheek is off on sabbatical, indulging in a little<br>
global gallivanting and some well deserved (and completely unstructured) hanging<br>
around.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it falls to me to write this editorial, making this only the second issue of<br>
<i>develop</i> that has had<i> two</i> pictures of me in it (trivia question: which was the other?),<br>
and also marking the first time (and hopefully the last time) my signature has been<br>
aired in public. (Yes, I know it's illegible, and I confess: I never really learned to<br>
write cursive. So it's only a rough approximation. Even my printing is barely legible.<br>
Thank goodness for keyboards.)
</p>
<p>
Unaccustomed as I am to editorial speaking, I was having a hard time thinking of<br>
something to write about. Fortuitously, Apple's Worldwide Developers<br>
Conferenceoccurred just about the time I needed to settle on a topic, and as always the<br>
developers I talked with at the conference brought up several issues about what we on<br>
the<i> develop</i> staff do and why we do it that way. 
</p>
<p>
One issue that came up is conveniently editorial in nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;We're often applauded for<br>
the better-than-usual (at least for a technical journal) writing in our articles and<br>
columns. It's quite true that in addition to trying to make sure everything in the<br>
magazine is correct, we also put a<i> lot</i> of ef fort into making it read well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is great<br>
for you, the reader, but as with any way of doing things there's a downside. In this<br>
case, it means more trouble and more work for those who generate the content of the<br>
journal. Occasionally an author thinks it's a hassle, all that fussing over finding the<br>
right word or phrase, all that questioning and worrying over something that's "off the<br>
topic" as far as they're concerned. For others, of course, it' s a real blessing, having<br>
our highly trained team of crackerjack editors swarming over their work, nipping and<br>
tucking and polishing it until it's snug and smooth and gleaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;While I naturally<br>
tend to side with the latter, ever ybody's entitled to an opinion. 
</p>
<p>
Those of us here at<i> develop</i> believe that it's absolutely worth it. It' s a truism about<br>
technical writing that if it's done well no one notices it.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's our goal, and always<br>
has been, and I think it' s a good and important one. If you have to read a sentence twice<br>
or three times to figure out what it means, or if you have to&nbsp;&nbsp;backtrack a page to make<br>
sense of something you just read, or if you can't find a constant in<i> Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i>because it's spelled wrong in the article, then the writing<i> will</i> be noticed,<br>
because it's getting in your way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's something we' re proud to avoid more often<br>
than not, even though it takes longer, and even though it's a lot more work.&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope<br>
you agree. 
</p>
<p>
So that's my editorial.&nbsp;&nbsp;An easy out, some might say, simply restating our editorial<br>
philosophy rather than coming up with new thoughts. But it's something that' s often<br>
lost in all the noise, and I think it's good -- both for us and for you -- to be reminded<br>
once in a while why it is we do what we do.

<p>
<b>DAVE JOHNSON</b> (dkj@apple.com) and his wife Lisa have a tiny but thriving<br>
mask-making business in San Francisco, selling masks for a one-month period each<br>
year around Halloween. In 1994 they had sales of $344 and gross profits were $159.<br>
(There was a write-down of $188 that year for retooling, resulting in a net loss of<br>
$29.) In 1995 they had total profits of $287 on&nbsp;&nbsp;sales of $330. If this explosive<br>
profit growth keeps up, this small garage business could, in time, be worth literally<br>
hundreds of millions of dollars. Dave is rubbing his hands in anticipation. *
