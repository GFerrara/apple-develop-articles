<h1> Macintosh Q &amp; A</h1>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>What books and articles would you recommend that provide strategies for<br>

debugging?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Here's a list of resources that can help you with debugging on the Macintosh:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to Write Macintosh Software by Scott Knaster and Keith Rollin<br>
(Addison-Wesley, 1992). This book describes how to find all the bugs you<br>
wrote when you used memory manipulation in C.</li>
<li>Debugging Macintosh Software With MacsBug, by Konstantin Othmer and<br>
Jim Straus (Addison-Wesley, 1991), and MacsBug Reference and Debugging<br>
Guide by Apple Computer, Inc. (Addison-Wesley, 1990). These books don't<br>
describe the latest version of MacsBug; check the MacsBug 6.5.2 release notes<br>
for additional details.</li>
<li>"Macintosh Debugging: A Weird Journey Into the Belly of the Beast" by<br>
Bo3b Johnson and Fred Huxham, develop Issue 8, and "Macintosh Debugging:<br>
The Belly of the Beast Revisited" by Fred Huxham and Greg Marriott, develop<br>
Issue 13.</li>
<li>"Debugging on PowerPC" by Dave Falkenburg and Brian Topping, develop<br>
Issue 17.</li>
<li>"Balance of Power: MacsBug for PowerPC" by Dave Evans and Jim<br>
Murphy, develop Issue 22.</li>
<li>"KON &amp; BAL's Puzzle Page," in every issue of develop since Issue 9.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I have a customer who's encountering a problem using my product. Can you suggest<br>

a way to use MacsBug to diagnose problems at a customer site?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Yes. Here, in a few easy steps, is a technique for using MacsBug to diagnose<br>

problems in the field:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Install a clean copy of the latest MacsBug.</li>
<li>Create a file using ResEdit (or Resorcerer, or whatever) containing an<br>
'mxbm' resource (which contains MacsBug macro definitions) and install it<br>
into the MacsBug Preferences folder.</li>
<li>In this 'mxbm' resource, define the macro everytime to call the stdloginto<br>
macro as follows:

<p>
stdloginto 'Send to the programmer'
</p>
</li>
<li>This way, if MacsBug is ever invoked due to a program error, a log of<br>
what occurred will be automatically generated. The log, named "Send to the<br>
programmer," will appear on the desktop.</li>
<li>Have your customer send you the log file created by the above steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>
See page 219 of the MacsBug Reference and Debugging Guide by Apple Computer, Inc.<br>
(Addison-Wesley, 1990) for details of the everytime macro. For details of what the<br>
stdloginto macro does, look at the 'mxbm' resource named "log stuff" in MacsBug's<br>
resource fork.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>We're developing an application that uses Apple Guide. It's working well on 680x0<br>

Macintosh computers but is presenting a problem on the Power Macintosh, because of<br>
AppleGuideGlue. If we import this library as "weak," the program runs but crashes<br>
when we call any Apple Guide routines. If we import "strong," the program simply<br>
refuses to run. What can we do?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Linking with the .xcoff file produces a reference to a shared library named<br>

AppleGuideGlue. Unfortunately, the Apple Guide extension provides a library named<br>
AppleGuideGlueLib instead, so the reference isn't resolved and the application fails to<br>
launch.
</p>
<p>
The AppleGuideGlue.xcoff file has been changed to AppleGuideGlueLib.xcoff on the latest<br>
Mac OS SDK CD. You can use that one, or just rename the one you have before including<br>
it in your project.
</p>
<p>
In MPW, you can rename the library in the link process. If you're using Symantec C or<br>
C++ or CodeWarrior, however, the name of the file has to be correct for the matching<br>
library to be found at run time. Note that CodeWarrior ignores the ".xcoff" suffix if<br>
it's present in the filename, while Symantec must have the ".xcoff" suffix to properly<br>
include the file in the project.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>My QuickDraw GX printer driver has a 'ptyp' of "A4 portrait" as the default paper<br>

type (via the isDefaultPaperType flag). But when a user chooses my driver from the<br>
Page Setup dialog, A4 is selected as the default paper type in the desktop printer,<br>
though my driver has no 'ptyp' named A4. How can I set my own paper type (A4<br>
portrait) as the default?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;The paper-matching code is working incorrectly. QuickDraw GX internally adds the<br>

standard paper types (such as A4 and US Letter) to the options for your driver. The<br>
bug is that QuickDraw GX thinks it's finding a better fit for the current page<br>
dimensions than the assigned A4 portrait paper type. It then defaults to the internal A4<br>
paper type.
</p>
<p>
The only workaround at this time is to remove the paper type that you're incorrectly<br>
defaulting to. If you're defaulting to a nonstandard paper type, such as Letterhead,<br>
Stationery, or Three-hole Punch, the best workaround is to remove that type from the<br>
Extensions folder. If you're defaulting to another paper type, the easiest thing you can<br>
do is to open your driver with a resource editor and remove or edit the 'ptyp' resource<br>
for the paper type that's incorrectly matching. (Open the resource and you'll see the<br>
paper type name embedded in the data.)
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'm creating a QuickDraw GX page that contains a line of single-layer text shapes,<br>

with each word a different color. The page displays correctly when it's opened in<br>
SimpleText but shows a bug when it's printed to a PostScript printer: each line prints<br>
with one color instead of each word being a different color. Any ideas?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;This is a bug that occurs only with single-layer text shapes that have a nil style in<br>

their face layer. There's a workaround that should be used anytime you do a one-layer<br>
text face, except for italics -- this workaround slows down italic drawing but speeds<br>
up all other cases.
</p>
<p>
Create a "generic" style object (with GXNewStyle) to replace the nil style. Set the text<br>
size to 1.0 (important) and the pen to 0 in the style. The other fields are irrelevant to<br>
this fix. Set your text face's style to this "generic" style and the problem will<br>
disappear.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'm having a problem, apparent at very small font sizes (6 points and below), with<br>

the output quality of some fonts that emerge from a QuickDraw GX vector driver. My<br>
application uses gxLayouts for text display and editing. If I create my output using<br>
GXDrawShape to render the layout shapes, the small characters begin to look very<br>
crude: character height varies by about 30% between some letters, and curved letter<br>
forms degenerate to rough polygons. What can I do to improve the quality?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Layouts (like all typographic shapes) have hints turned on by default. If the font<br>

you're using isn't hinted at small point sizes, using hints messes up the appearance of<br>
the text rather than helping it. Try using the layout shape and setting the<br>
gxNoMetricsGridText and gxNoContourGridText bits in the text attributes. The results<br>
at small sizes should be better.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'm writing an Open Transport client program, and I'm confused about how to<br>

perform an orderly release when I receive the T_ORDREL message. When I get the<br>
T_ORDREL message I'm supposed to call OTRcvOrderlyDisconnect. The documentation<br>
for OTRcvOrderlyDisconnect says that I can then continue to send data but that I can't<br>
read data without getting an "out of state" error (kOTOutStateErr). Is this correct?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Yes, it is. Your confusion is due more to the dynamics and subtleties of X/Open<br>

Transport Interface (XTI) programming than to Open Transport itself.
</p>
<p>
Let's examine an orderly disconnect situation. Assume that two nodes have an<br>
established TCP connection. Endpoint A has finished sending data and indicates closure<br>
by invoking an OTSndOrderlyDisconnect call (this translates into sending an<br>
end-of-file signal -- FIN -- over the wire). Endpoint B receives a T_ORDREL<br>
message. If, however, B hasn't finished receiving the data, B must continue until it<br>
gets back kOTNoDataErr. At this point, B initiates an OTRcvOrderlyDisconnect (which<br>
acknowledges A's FIN). This is known as a "half-close"; B can still send data to A<br>
(which will still receive T_DATA events), but if A attempts to send to B, A will<br>
receive an "out of state" error.
</p>
<p>
A, of course, should also continue accepting data until receiving kOTNoDataErr. A<br>
should then call OTRcvOrderlyDisconnect, thereby completing the other side of the link<br>
teardown. Both sides can then unbind.
</p>
<p>
If, however, either endpoint's network code is written such that T_ORDREL and<br>
T_DATA events are handled at different priorities (for instance, the T_ORDREL is<br>
handled at the notifier, but the T_DATA is deferred to SystemTask time), a race<br>
condition can occur. Your program must ensure that all data has been read before<br>
calling OTRcvOrderlyDisconnect.
</p>
<p>
There's also a subtlety of XTI programming that you should be aware of. It's possible<br>
that OTSndOrderlyDisconnect or OTRcvOrderlyDisconnect will return with a TLOOK<br>
error. This means that there's another event pending; your program must call OTLook<br>
to gather that event.
</p>
<p>
According to the XTI specification, the OTSndOrderlyDisconnect and<br>
OTRcvOrderlyDisconnect calls can fail because of a pending T_DISCONNECT event. XTI<br>
is trying to tell you that the connection to that endpoint broke. This can happen easily<br>
in our modern, wacky, asynchronous world of networks, and your program will have<br>
to call OTRcvDisconnect to acknowledge that your endpoint dropped.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I've implemented a server endpoint that hands off the connection to a hand-off<br>

endpoint. After the server processes a connect request with the OTAccept call, the<br>
asynchronous handler for the hand-off endpoint is passed a T_DATA event. When the<br>
handler makes the OTRcv call, however, it returns error -3168<br>
(kOTStateChangeErr). Can you explain this?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;This problem occurs only when there's a hand-off (secondary) endpoint involved.<br>

The way Open Transport is implemented, it's possible for an asynchronous hand-off<br>
endpoint to receive a T_DATA event before the connect mechanism is completed. After<br>
accepting a connection, an asynchronous listener endpoint can expect to receive a<br>
T_ACCEPTCOMPLETE call. The "accepting" or hand-off endpoint can expect to receive<br>
the T_PASSCON event.
</p>
<p>
It's possible for the hand-off endpoint to receive the T_DATA event before receiving<br>
the T_PASSCON event, and this apparently is what's happening to you. When this<br>
happens, set a flag to defer receiving the data until later. After the T_PASSCON event is<br>
received, check the flag and issue the OTRcv call if the flag is set. (Note that after<br>
deferring the handling of the T_DATA event, your handler won't receive this event<br>
again until you process all of the data presently available.)
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>What's the relationship between the classic AppleTalk "self-send" variable and the<br>

one in Open Transport AppleTalk?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;In version 1.1, Open Transport AppleTalk shares the self-send variable with<br>

classic AppleTalk, so if you set the variable with the classic PSetSelfSend call, the<br>
effects are seen by both AppleTalk and Open Transport clients. If you're using Open<br>
Transport, you can change the variable with an OTIoctl call, as shown here:
</p>
<pre>enum {
   kATalkFullSelfSend      = MIOC_CMD(MIOC_ATALK, 47)
};

static OSStatus OTSetSelfSend(EndpointRef ep,
     Boolean enable_self_send)
{
   OSStatus result;

   result = OTIoctl(ep, kATalkFullSelfSend,
               (void *) enable_self_send);
   if (result &gt; 0)
      result = 0;
   return result;
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Note that like the PSetSelfSend call, the OTIoctl call returns the previous value of the<br>
self-send variable as either 0 (it was previously disabled) or 1 (it was previously<br>
enabled). As in classic AppleTalk, it's rarely appropriate to restore the value of<br>
self-send when you're done, so the code above maps both results to 0 (noErr).
</p>
<p>
Here's why the value shouldn't be restored. The self-send value is a Boolean, not a<br>
counter. For example, imagine the following sequence:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-send starts out false.</li>
<li>Client A sets self-send to true and is returned false as the previous value.</li>
<li>Client B sets self-send to true and is returned true as the previous value.</li>
<li>Client A quits, "restoring" self-send to false.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the end, client B is left with self-send set to false, which is incorrect.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, the standard practice is to set self-send if you need it and not attempt<br>
to restore it when finished. Because many clients follow this convention, it's<br>
important that your program work even if self-send is true.
</p>
<p>
Future versions of Open Transport will most likely have self-send always on for Open<br>
Transport native clients, and loop-back packets will be filtered out only for classic<br>
clients if PSetSelfSend wasn't called.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>When I make a synchronous OTConnect call from a TCP client to a TCP server that's<br>

passively awaiting an incoming connection, I find that even before the server responds<br>
with the OTListen and OTAccept calls, the OTConnect call completes with no error. At<br>
this point, if I examine the client endpoint state, I find that it's in the T_DATAXFER<br>
state. Can you explain this?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;As mentioned in the XTI specification (available with the Open Transport release),<br>

"TCP does not allow the possibility of refusing a connection indication. Each connect<br>
indication causes the TCP transport provider to establish the connection. Therefore<br>
t_listen() and t_accept() have a semantic which is slightly different than that for ISO<br>
providers." Consequently, the server will accept the TCP connection request if the<br>
current number of connections allows it. The XTI specification states that "when the<br>
transport detects a T_LISTEN, TCP has already established the connection." The client,<br>
whether in synchronous or asynchronous mode, will receive notice that the connection<br>
was established. For synchronous endpoints, TCP completes the three-way connection<br>
handshake. For asynchronous endpoints, the OTRcvConnect call must be made to<br>
complete the handshake.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>In my Open Transport TCP-based server application, I use a specific socket for<br>

receiving incoming connection requests. If I relaunch the server immediately after<br>
quitting, the initialization calls complete without error, but the server never receives<br>
any incoming connection requests. If I wait several minutes before relaunching the<br>
server, this problem doesn't occur. It appears that there's some internal timeout for<br>
disconnected connections. Is there a solution to this problem so that the server can be<br>
relaunched without waiting for the timeout?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;TCP has a two-minute timeout on a binding after a connection has closed before the<br>

same port can be bound to again. This prevents stale data from corrupting a new<br>
connection. For this reason, you see a delay before you can successfully bind to the<br>
port again.
</p>
<p>
There's a way around this, using the IP_REUSEADDR option and the<br>
OTOptionManagement call. Set this option on all of your listening endpoints before you<br>
bind, and the problem should disappear.
</p>
<p>
Note that even after you use the IP_REUSEADDR option, at most one endpoint that's in a<br>
state less than connected (listening; unbound doesn't count) may be bound to a given<br>
port. Any number of connected or closing endpoints may be so bound to other unique<br>
ports, however.
</p>
<p>
The following sample shows how to set this option. The function takes two input<br>
parameters, the EndpointRef that you want to set the option for, and the state of the<br>
option that you want, typically true. The function returns a result of OSStatus: if<br>
negative, it's the error returned from the OTOptionManagement call; if positive, it's<br>
the status field returned by OTOptionManagement (this means the call completed<br>
successfully but the status field had a value other than T_SUCCESS). If 0<br>
(kOTNoError), then of course there was no error.
</p>
<pre>#include &lt;OpenTransport.h&gt;            // Open Transport files
#include &lt;OpenTptInternet.h&gt;
/* input:   reuseState (true: no delay, false: normal delay state)
   output: if result less than kOTNoError, it's the error returned by
   OTOptionManagement. Otherwise, the status value is returned as
   defined in OpenTransport.h:
      T_SUCCESS       = 0x020,      return kOTNoError if success
      T_FAILURE       = 0x040,
      T_PARTSUCCESS   = 0x100,
      T_READONLY      = 0x200,
      T_NOTSUPPORT    = 0x400

     if (opt-&gt;status != T_SUCCESS)   // If not T_SUCCESS, return
        err = opt-&gt;status;           // the status.
  }
  return err;

<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'm implementing a passive TCP connection. Can I hand off the connection to a<br>

different port address?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;No, the hand-off connection endpoint must be bound to the same address as the<br>

endpoint that passed off the connection. This is an XTI requirement, as discussed in<br>
Appendix B of the XTI specification, Section B.3.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'd like my network client software to be able to abort an asynchronous OTConnect<br>

in progress -- to allow a user, for example, to recover from an attempted connection<br>
to a nonexistent IP address. I've been calling OTSndDisconnect to abort it, but when I<br>
check the return code, I get a kOTOutStateErr error. What gives?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Using an OTSndDisconnect is the proper way to abort an OTConnect in progress.<br>

After a successful call to OTConnect, the endpoint state will transition from T_IDLE to<br>
T_OUTCON. Calling OTSndDisconnect returns the endpoint state to T_IDLE.
</p>
<p>
You may be getting kOTOutStateErr for one of the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The original OTConnect failed. Determine this by checking the OTConnect<br>
result.</li>
<li>The connection broke and was asynchronously handled by your notifier. In<br>
this case, your endpoint would no longer be in the T_OUTCON state before you<br>
do the disconnect.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A good rule of thumb is always to confirm the endpoint state before doing the<br>
OTSndDisconnect to ensure that the endpoint isn't already disconnected.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I have a question regarding T_DATA event handling for multiple active endpoints.<br>

Let's say I have two endpoints open, endpoint 1 and endpoint 2. Data arrives for<br>
endpoint 1, which then receives a T_DATA event. If data arrives for endpoint 2 before<br>
the data for endpoint 1 is read, it's my understanding that endpoint 2 won't get a<br>
T_DATA event until the data for endpoint 1 is read. Is that correct? In other words,<br>
does Open Transport queue multiple T_DATA events corresponding to multiple<br>
endpoints?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;XTI or Open Transport endpoints are handled independently of each other. Whatever<br>

events are pending on one endpoint have (for the most part) no effect on any other<br>
endpoints.
</p>
<p>
Assume that endpoint 1 gets notified of a T_DATA event. Following this, a separate<br>
T_DATA event is queued up for endpoint 2. As soon as the notifier for endpoint 1<br>
completes and returns to Open Transport, the notifier for endpoint 2 will be invoked.<br>
This behavior isn't contingent upon whether endpoint 1 processed the event, although<br>
of course endpoint 1 won't receive any more T_DATA events until its current T_DATA<br>
event is cleared. Keep in mind that waiting too long to process endpoint 1's T_DATA<br>
event will result in the exhaustion of buffers in the lower protocol layers.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Given an AppleTalk network and the node address of a Macintosh, how can I<br>

remotely retrieve the Network Name specified in the Sharing Setup control panel?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;The only universal way to determine a Macintosh's "flagship" name is to target an<br>

NBP lookup of type "workstation" to that particular node. At first glance, it would<br>
seem that we could get the desired result by calling PConfirmName (since it allows us<br>
to direct the NBP LkUp to the specific node by using the confirmAddr field, whereas<br>
PLookupName would broadcast it to an entire zone). The PConfirmName call doesn't<br>
return the NBP Tuple information to the application, however: under classic<br>
AppleTalk, PConfirmName's sole purpose is to confirm or deny the existence of a<br>
registered NBP name. This leaves you with several alternatives.
</p>
<p>
Under classic AppleTalk, you have two options. The first option is to use the<br>
PLookupName call. This is a little complicated because PLookupName requires that you<br>
specify the "zone name" of the target node. You have to call GetZoneList and parse<br>
through the replies (illustrated in Inside Macintosh: Networking, page 4-7) to extract<br>
a list of zone names that correspond to your target's network number. (Note that if<br>
you're on an extended network, it's possible for an AppleTalk zone to have a range of<br>
network numbers.) Once you have a list of suspected network zones that the target is<br>
on, you can then direct a PLookupName to those zones and parse through the responses<br>
to find the one that matches your target's node address.
</p>
<p>
The second option under classic AppleTalk is to form the NBP LkUp packet yourself and<br>
send it via DDP. You can open and register your own DDP listener by using the<br>
POpenSkt call. You can then form your own NBP LkUp packet and transmit it to the<br>
target node's NBP listener socket (socket 2) with the PWriteDDP call. The target will<br>
respond to you with an NBP LkUp-Reply, which will cause your DDP socket listener to<br>
be called. You can parse the reply there.
</p>
<p>
Writing a DDP socket listener is tricky, but it's illustrated in the Network Watch<br>
(DMZ) sample provided on this issue's CD. Examine the doEcho function in the files<br>
dMZAT.c and SktListener.a. Writing a socket listener for the Power Macintosh can be<br>
challenging because of classic AppleTalk's 680x0 roots. If you're stuck with a classic<br>
AppleTalk system, however, this is the recommended approach.
</p>
<p>
If your code is written to run under Open Transport, you're in luck. You can specify<br>
the target address in the TLookupRequest data structure used by the OTLookupName<br>
function. Check out the DoSendLkUpReq function in DDPSample.cp, found on any Open<br>
Transport SDK CD. Since the programming model is so much simpler, you may want to<br>
investigate the Open Transport approach.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I need to get the full pathname to a document in a callback where the only relevant<br>

piece of information I have is the WindowPtr for the window that contains the<br>
document. I can get the filename from the window title, but I don't know the directory<br>
ID or volume reference number. Is there any way to obtain the dirID and vRefNum<br>
from the WindowRecord?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;No, there's no way to extract the file system information you need from a<br>

WindowRecord. A WindowRecord includes only structural human interface information<br>
(which might include the filename as the window's title) and has no intrinsic tie to any<br>
file on the disk. As you've implied, you must have the directory ID and volume<br>
reference number to extract a full pathname. Once you know the vRefNum and the<br>
parent dirID, you'll be able to use one of the full path routines in the sample code<br>
MoreFiles on this issue's CD to construct a full pathname.
</p>

If the file is open and you have the refNum for its access path, you can call<br>
PBGetFCBInfo to get the vRefNum and dirID (and then use them to get the pathname).<br>
For more information on PBGetFCBInfo, see Inside Macintosh: Files, pages 2-237<br>
through 2-238.

<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>We sell a game that incorporates our own proprietary 3D technology. We'd like to<br>

be able to take advantage of 3D acceleration hardware, if it's available on the user's<br>
system. What do you recommend we use?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Use the Rendering Acceleration Virtual Engine (RAVE) application development<br>

interface, which defines an abstract standardized hardware interface for applications<br>
to communicate with and control 3D hardware. If you adapt your game to draw to RAVE,<br>
it'll be compatible with any hardware 3D accelerators with RAVE-compatible drivers.<br>
RAVE is also a cross-platform specification, so code you write for the Macintosh will<br>
be easier to port to Windows 95 or Windows NT (if at some point in the future RAVE is<br>
implemented for Windows).

<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>We created a QuickDraw 3D application similar to the TextureEyes demo<br>

distributed by Apple: it maps a moving image texture onto a spinning cube. The display<br>
quality of TextureEyes, however, is much better than ours. We're using large<br>
high-quality textures (480 x 320), but the image mapped onto the cube is quite<br>
chunky even with a 3D accelerator card, and the animation seems to be slower and<br>
jerkier. What's TextureEyes' secret?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;No secrets: TextureEyes is a straightforward implementation of the texturing of<br>

QuickDraw 3D geometries. The problem is that the quality of your textures is actually<br>
too high!
</p>
<p>
QuickDraw 3D uses a trilinear MIP map algorithm to obtain the best possible quality<br>
texture mapping. To create an MIP map from an image requires creating subimages<br>
sized for every inverse power of 4 -- that is, 1/4, 1/16, 1/64, and so on. The<br>
process of creating an MIP map for every texture takes time, and larger textures take<br>
longer. TextureEyes uses a 128 x 128 source for its movie and video textures. For<br>
more information on MIP maps, see Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice, by<br>
Foley, VanDam, Feiner, and Hughes (Addison-Wesley, 1996).

<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>My quartz watch is eerily accurate. Why?</i><br>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;A quartz watch uses the vibrations of a quartz crystal as its time reference. The<br>

frequency of vibration in the crystal depends on three factors: voltage, pressure, and<br>
temperature. To keep the watch accurate, all three of these must be kept constant.
</p>
<p>
The electronics in the watch provide a nice constant voltage, and the atmosphere<br>
provides a nice constant pressure. But what really ensures that the watch is accurate<br>
is that it's worn on your wrist: the constant temperature of your body in contact with<br>
the watch ensures that the crystal operates at a constant temperature.
