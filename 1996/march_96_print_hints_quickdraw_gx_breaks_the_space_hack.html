<i>Before QuickDraw GX, when an application that generated its own PostScript(TM) code</i><br>
<i>wanted to make sure the printer could print a particular font, it could send one space</i><br>
<i>character in the needed font. The LaserWriter driver would check the printer to see if</i><br>
<i>the font was available, and if not, the driver would send the font to the printer so that</i><br>
<i>it would be available to print the space character -- and any other characters in that</i><br>
<i>font that the application-generated PostScript code might require. The reason for</i><br>
<i>using a space was simple: you didn't want to mark the page just to get a font to the</i><br>
<i>printer, and a space wouldn't mark it. This technique, first described in "The Perils of</i><br>
<i>PostScript" back in develop Issue 1, became known as the "space hack."</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the space hack doesn't work with QuickDraw GX. This column</i><br>
<i>describes a new way for applications that generate their own PostScript code to send</i><br>
<i>fonts to the printer. The code to do this is provided on this issue's CD.</i>
</p>
<h2>QUICKDRAW GX CHANGES THE PICTURE</h2>
<p>
QuickDraw GX has a really cool imaging model, supports all kinds of whizzy features,<br>
and to top it off, introduces the long-awaited new printing architecture. But it has one<br>
snag: after all the years you've spent getting your PostScript printing tuned just the<br>
way you like it, QuickDraw GX breaks the space hack.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The space hack depends on a font's entire character set being sent to the printer in<br>
response to the need for a single character (the space character). But QuickDraw GX<br>
sends only the needed characters in a font to a printer, because it's trying to conserve<br>
memory on the printer and also because sending less data means faster transmission of<br>
that data. This isn't such a big issue with Roman fonts, where there are only 256<br>
characters at most, but in the case of two-byte fonts such as Chinese, Japanese, and<br>
Korean fonts, where there can be tens of thousands of characters and the font can be<br>
tens of megabytes in size, sending only the required characters makes a big difference<br>
in speed.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, with QuickDraw GX you don't need a specialized printer to print two-byte<br>
fonts. It divides fonts with more than 256 characters into several smaller fonts with<br>
new encodings containing just the characters you need, so you can print characters<br>
from the font on any PostScript printer.
</p>
<h2>THE NEW WAY TO DOWNLOAD FONTS</h2>
<p>
So QuickDraw GX has lots of advantages over QuickDraw, but the space hack is broken.<br>
What's the poor programmer to do?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use a new font downloading method based on calling GXFlattenFont, a handy<br>
function introduced with QuickDraw GX, to convert the font to a form that's easily sent<br>
to the printer. GXFlattenFont is intended to convert any font present on your Macintosh<br>
into the output font format of your choice. (Conversion is limited by the capabilities of<br>
the scalers present, as explained in "QuickDraw GX Font Scalers.")
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QUICKDRAW GX FONT SCALERS</b>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The QuickDraw GX Open Font Architecture accepts drop-in font scalers. A font<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scaler is a bit of code that takes a font of a given type and converts it to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bitmaps for display. It also converts fonts to outline format and can optionally<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;convert a font to another font format. QuickDraw GX includes three default<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scalers:
</p>
<ul>
                    <li style="margin-left: 44px">the bitmap scaler, which is essentially the same as in QuickDraw</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 44px">the TrueType GX scaler, which supports the TrueType GX format</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 44px">the Type 1 scaler, which is part of Adobe(TM) Type Manager</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these default scalers are capable of generating bitmaps for screen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;display and PostScript fonts for printing. Only the TrueType GX scaler can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generate downloadable TrueType fonts.
</p>
<p>
GXFlattenFont can produce Type 1 data that's ready to be sent to your PostScript<br>
printer with no problem.
</p>
<p>
Now let's turn to the code that replaces the old space hack. The rough idea is to call<br>
GXFlattenFont on a QuickDraw font reference and a set of characters&nbsp;&nbsp;(an encoding)<br>
that you need to print, and return the result in a form that's easy to send to the<br>
printer. For simplicity, if no encoding is present, we use the standard Macintosh<br>
encoding. Listing 1 shows a font-downloading routine, FontToPict, that uses this<br>
technique if QuickDraw GX is installed. (This is a somewhat simplified version; see the<br>
CD for the full code of FontToPict and its related utility functions.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1. </b>FontToPict
</p>
<pre>PicHandle FontToPict(short qdFont, short qdStyle)
{
   Rect         theRect = {0, 0, 1, 1};
   PicHandle      thePict = OpenPicture(&amp;theRect);
   const   short   kPostScriptHandle = 192;

   // If QuickDraw GX is installed, use the new method.
   if (GXInstalled()) {
      Handle            piccommentHdl;
      unsigned   short   *myEncoding = nil;
     
      MakePSHandle(qdFont, qdStyle, myEncoding, &amp;piccommentHdl);
      PicComment(kPostScriptHandle, GetHandleSize(piccommentHdl),
          piccommentHdl);
   } else {
     // If QuickDraw GX isn't installed, use the old method.
      Point   penPoint;

      // We would normally set the clip here, but since we're just
      // drawing a space there's no need.
      GetPen(&amp;penPoint);             // Save the pen location.
      TextFont(qdFont);
      TextFace(qdStyle);
      DrawChar(' ');
      MoveTo(penPoint.h, penPoint.v);    // Restore the pen location.
   }
   ClosePicture();
   return (thePict);
)</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
FontToPict starts by checking to see if QuickDraw GX is installed. If not, it uses the old<br>
hack of printing a space; otherwise, it calls MakePSHandle (Listing 2), which calls<br>
the utility function ConvertQDFontToGXFont&nbsp;&nbsp;to convert the QuickDraw font reference<br>
into a QuickDraw GX font reference. MakePSHandle then checks to see if an encoding<br>
has been passed in; if not, it builds the standard Macintosh encoding. Next it&nbsp;&nbsp;calls<br>
FontToHandle, which is just a wrapper for GXFlattenFont. GXFlattenFont converts the<br>
specified font to the Type 1 format. Error-handling and cleanup code is last.<br>
Simplicity itself! The result, whether QuickDraw GX is present or not, is a PICT that<br>
you can send to the printer by calling DrawPicture once the printer port has been<br>
opened.
</p>
<p>
When calling MakePSHandle, you should specify an encoding array that contains the<br>
characters you intend to actually print. This prevents QuickDraw GX from sending the<br>
entire font to the printer and becomes very important when you make your application<br>
WorldScript aware. There's an #ifdef in the code on the CD that generates only the<br>
encoding array you need in order to use a portion of the font. As mentioned earlier,<br>
with Chinese, Japanese, and Korean fonts, sending only the characters you need can<br>
make the difference between sending a few kilobytes or many megabytes of data to the<br>
printer. If you don't use the entire font, remember to encode the characters that you<br>
want to draw,&nbsp;&nbsp;using the same encoding that you passed in to the MakePSHandle<br>
function.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 2.</b> MakePSHandle
</p>
<pre>OSErr MakePSHandle(short qdFont, char qdStyle,
    unsigned short *encodingArray, Handle *outputHandle)
{
   OSErr            status = noErr;
   gxFont            theFont;
   unsigned short   *myEncoding;
   Boolean         madeEncoding = false;

   // Convert to a QuickDraw GX font reference.
   theFont = ConvertQDFontToGXFont(qdFont, qdStyle);

   // If no encoding, create the standard Macintosh encoding.
   if (!encodingArray) {
      long   returnLength;

      myEncoding =
          (unsigned short *)NewPtrClear(256 * sizeof(short));
      returnLength = MakeMac8BitEncoding(theFont, myEncoding);
      if (returnLength != 256) {
         DebugStr("\pHmm. We didn't get a full encoding.");
         return (returnLength);      // Pass the error along.
      }
      madeEncoding = true;
   } else {
      myEncoding = encodingArray;
   }

   *outputHandle = FontToHandle(theFont, myEncoding);
   if (madeEncoding) DisposePtr((Ptr)myEncoding);

   status = MemError();
   if (status == noErr) {
      status = GXGetGraphicsError(nil);
      if (status != noErr) {
         DisposeHandle(*outputHandle);
         *outputHandle = nil;
      }
   }
   return (status);
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You may want to have HandleSpoolProc (which is called by GXFlattenFont and included<br>
on the CD) spool directly to the printer via picture comments. This way you won't need<br>
memory available to hold the font data at the intermediate steps.
</p>
<h2>DOWNLOADING HAPPINESS</h2>
<p>
The new font downloading method takes a little more work but produces better results<br>
in your printer font handling. You can easily send needed fonts to the printer, either<br>
the whole font or only the characters you'll be using. As a side benefit, you get support<br>
for two-byte font systems without having to write custom&nbsp;&nbsp;code for handling the large<br>
fonts or, worse yet, having to depend on the fonts being installed on the printer in a<br>
specific manner. Even if you're not ready to add QuickDraw GX imaging to your<br>
application today, adding QuickDraw GX compatibility improves the printing<br>
experience for your customers.

Technical Support group. He's been told that supporting printing leads to hair loss and<br>
insanity. Dave previously lived in beautiful sunny Minnesota, and wonders if he'll get<br>
used to the harsh San Francisco Bay Area winters before he's bald and crazy, or if it's<br>
already too late.*

Thanks to Dan Lipton for providing the idea and core code illustrating the new font<br>
downloading method, and to Pete "Luke" Alexander, Dave Hersey, and Dan Lipton for<br>
reviewing this column.*
