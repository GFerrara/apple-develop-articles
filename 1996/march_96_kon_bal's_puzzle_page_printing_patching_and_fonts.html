<p>
<b>Dave</b> Hey cam, it's kinda quiet. Where are KON and BAL?
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;cam</b> Since the local salad bar closed, I haven't seen KON. BAL disappeared after he left<br>
the video game industry. Have you been getting enough sleep? You look tired.
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Dave</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been under a lot of pressure to track down this bug.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I can help. What's the problem?
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Dave</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a Power Mac 6100/66 running System 7.5 with QuickDraw GX 1.1.<br>
When I try to print from a word processor, I get the message "The application has<br>
unexpectedly quit, because an error of type 11 occurred." What's an error of type 11?
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;That's an unhandled exception from native code. What word processor are you<br>
using?
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Um, a very large one in a very large office suite from a very large company up<br>
north.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you updated to version 1.1.3 of QuickDraw GX?
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Yeah. The problem still happens.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it happen on any other machine?
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Yes. It crashes on any Power Mac but works fine on 680x0 machines.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm. Is the word processor native on the Power Mac?
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Yes -- it's fat.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It sure is. But I have the same version of system software and the same word<br>
processor, yet my machine doesn't crash.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Well, I have a standard system installed, but I added a bunch of whizzy fonts.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If I install one of your fonts, will my machine crash?
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Sometimes. If you install all my fonts, it crashes all the time.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;That's easy, then: bad fonts. Here, take out this Thingamajigs font.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> No way, man. This is a standard bitmap-only font. It should work. Ike's machine<br>
doesn't have Thingamajigs on it and his machine still crashes.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he have bitmap-only fonts installed?
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Yes.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;At what point in the printing process do you crash?
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> The crash occurs just as the application starts spooling the print file.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this word processor QuickDraw GX-aware?
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Yes. It has support for the new QuickDraw GX print dialogs, and it calls the<br>
QuickDraw GX translator to translate QuickDraw drawing commands into QuickDraw<br>
GX shapes during printing.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Good for them. Have you tried to reproduce the crash with other QuickDraw<br>
GX-aware applications?
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Yup. I tried to reproduce it with several QuickDraw GX-aware and QuickDraw<br>
GX-savvy applications. No luck.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Try running the 680x0 version of this program on your Power Mac. It will be<br>
slow and piggy, but try it anyway.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> The problem went away! So, the crash seems to have something to do with the<br>
PowerPC code in this application.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm. Let's install MacsBug and take a look at this from the debugger.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> I tried that before, but I couldn't see any symbols in the PowerPC code where it<br>
crashes. I couldn't tell which routine the PC was in.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;You should install the new version of MacsBug. Version 6.5.2 understands native<br>
exceptions and can use embedded symbols.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Nifty. . . . OK, I've done that. But I still crash.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you crash? Type <b>how</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> MacsBug claims that there was a "PowerPC access exception at 001DB030<br>
ConstructNFNTDirectory+002B4."
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;What does ConstructNFNTDirectory do? Hey, wait, there's Alex Beaman. Alex,<br>
can you help us out here?
</p>
<p>
<b>Alex</b> Sure. QuickDraw GX views all fonts as type 'sfnt'. It's really elegant:<br>
ConstructNFNTDirectory will make an NFNT font appear to have an 'sfnt' directory. It<br>
can build either just the directory header or the entire directory, and this is<br>
controlled by a Boolean parameter passed into the function. OK, gotta run!
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Thanks, Alex. When I disassemble ConstructNFNTDirectory with MacsBug, I get<br>
this:

<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;An access exception means we're trying to read or write to an invalid address.<br>
That, of course, could be caused by many things, such as uninitialized variables or<br>
trashed memory. Let's check the heaps with <b>hc</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Both the system heap and the application heap are fine.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, I restart the program and use <b>brp</b> in MacsBug to set a breakpoint at<br>
ConstructNFNTDirectory. <b>brp</b> is just like <b>br</b>, except it works for PowerPC code.<br>
After I start printing and the breakpoint is hit, I step through this function to follow<br>
the code flow.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> At offset 0x0300 you don't take that branch, and you eventually begin executing<br>
code that will corrupt the QuickDraw GX heap.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;But that's wrong -- we should've taken that branch. The caller didn't ask<br>
ConstructNFNTDirectory to create the entire directory, just its header; it didn't<br>
allocate enough space for all of it. Check the heaps again.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> The heaps seem fine. QuickDraw GX allocates out of its own heap, which MacsBug<br>
doesn't know about. Even if it did know about it, it wouldn't be able to tell us if the heap<br>
was corrupt, as QuickDraw GX has its own memory manager.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Darn, memory corruption bugs are the worst. You can trash memory and not see<br>
the effects of it until you're miles away from that code. OK, why didn't it take the<br>
branch at offset 0x0300?
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Well, CR2 is true, so the branch won't be taken.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;How can you tell that CR2 is true?
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> The PowerPC chip has eight condition register fields, CR0 through CR7, stored<br>
in nibbles in a 32-bit condition register (Dave Evans talked about this in his column<br>
in <i>develop</i> Issue 21). So the value of CR2 would be bits 8 through 11 of the condition<br>
register. The chip has its bits numbered from 0 through 31, from left to right. We can<br>
tell that CR2 contains a true value because its second logical bit isn't set. That bit<br>
corresponds to the equals operator, so the fact that it's 0 means the operation that set<br>
this register was not equal.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sets up CR2?
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> The code at offset 0x00F0. As Alex mentioned, one of the parameters to this<br>
function is a Boolean that controls whether the whole directory is created or only the<br>
header. Because this parameter is a Boolean, the PowerPC processor can just compare<br>
it against 0 and use the result as a flag for later branches. Parameters passed in<br>
PowerPC code are put from left to right into registers R3 through R10; since this<br>
parameter is the third parameter to the function, it's passed to the routine in register<br>
R5. (A much better description of this is in<i>Inside Macintosh: PowerPC System</i><br>
<i>Software</i>.)
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I love this chip. I'll reexecute the program and get back to the start of this<br>
function and examine CR2.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> It starts out false.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;So someone's trashing it along the way. Well, we can't use some of our normal<br>
tricks for detecting when memory gets trashed. One problem is that step spy doesn't<br>
work yet for PowerPC. Another problem is that we would want to step spy on CR2,<br>
which is a register, and step spy never worked on registers. We'll have to do this the<br>
hard way: let's&nbsp;&nbsp;step through this function, watching CR2 to see just when it gets<br>
changed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> The subroutine GetNoLoadResource at offset 0x0068 changes CR2 from false to<br>
true. GetNoLoadResource is a wrapper to GetResource.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I restart the program and trace over the GetResource call.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Yep, that's the function that trashes CR2.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it legal for the compiler to rely on CR2 being preserved across function calls?
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Yes. According to the PowerPC ABI (Application Binary Interface) documentation<br>
-- section 3.6 in the first edition -- CR2 through CR5 are nonvolatile and need to be<br>
saved across function calls.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the code for GetResource. Since in System 7.5 GetResource is a native<br>
trap with a routine descriptor, I can use the MacsBug dcmd <b>drd</b> to dump that out.<br>
Here's what I get:
</p>
<pre>drd GetResource
 The RoutineDescriptor at:      011EDFEC
    Mixed Mode Magic Trap: AAFE, version: 07,
    routine descriptor flags: 00 (NotIndexable),
    loadLocation: 00000000, reserved2: 00,
    selectorInfo: 00 (No Selector),
    routine count: 0000
    --- Routine Record 00000000 -----
    procInfo: 000002F0, reserved1: 00, ISAType: 01 (kPowerPCISA),
    Routine Flags: 0004 (IsAbsolute, IsPrepared, NativeISA,
        PassSelector, IsNotDefault), procPtr: 01219EEC,
    storedOffset: 00000000, selector: 00000000</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> There's only one routine associated with the trap and it's the native<br>
implementation.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where's that function? On the Power Mac, every ProcPtr is actually a data<br>
structure that contains the routine's real address and TOC. This is called a TVector<br>
(transition vector). This allows every fragment to have its own globals, because the<br>
correct TOC gets loaded for each routine by the runtime environment. So, to find the<br>
routine's address, you need to dereference the ProcPtr.
</p>
<h2>WH 1219EEC^</h2>
<pre>Address 00E77B78 is in the "Porky WProcessor" heap at 00DFC430
The address is in a CFM fragment "Porky WProcessor" [non-write exec]
It is 00073058 bytes into this heap block:
  Start      Length      Tag  Mstr  Ptr  Lock Prg Type ID  File Name
* 00E04B20   003D35D8+0C N</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Apparently it's in the heap of the application.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;So this program is patching GetResource. At least they have a native patch -- a<br>
good habit these days because you don't know what traps will go native from now on. If<br>
you're patching native PowerPC code with 680x0 code, performance-sensitive code<br>
will run slower. For this reason, you should make all of your patches fat. Let's<br>
disassemble the patch on GetResource.

<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> At 0x00E77B9C they do a compare and store the result in CR2. However, they<br>
don't save and restore CR2 across this function, so it's trashed when we return to<br>
ConstructNFNTDirectory.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, I restart the program and manually save and restore the value of CR2 across<br>
the GetResource calls. I do this by futzing with bit 2 in CR2.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Everything prints fine.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like a compiler bug. Either they shouldn't be using CR2 or they should be<br>
preserving it. In any case, the GetResource patch is trashing CR2, and that changes a<br>
Boolean which causes us to read in extra data. The caller never allocated enough space<br>
for the extra data, so the QuickDraw GX heap gets corrupted.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Holy cow! A compiler bug. Shouldn't we notify the compiler developer?
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this company has their own in-house development tools group. They write<br>
their own compilers, linkers, and debuggers. We should contact them anyway, so that<br>
they can create a patch that fixes this problem. [<i>This patch, "Office4.2x Update for</i><br>
<i>Power Mac," is now available on most online services.</i>]
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Why are they patching GetResource?
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like they were looking for resources of type 'MBDF' (menu bar<br>
definition procedures). I can tell this from the instructions at addresses 0x00E77B94<br>
through 0x00E77B9C. The PowerPC architecture has a limitation of 16 bits on the<br>
size of an immediate constant. So, if you wanted to compare a value against a 32-bit<br>
constant, you would have to build the 32-bit value with two instructions. This is what<br>
occurs at addresses 0x00E77B94 and 0x00E77B98, where they insert 0x4D42 and<br>
0x4446 together into a 32-bit value. If you look at the ASCII of this constant, it's<br>
'MBDF'. At address 0x00E77B9C, they compare this constant to the resource type<br>
parameter passed to GetResource. Since that parameter is the first parameter, it will<br>
be in register R3.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Why didn't we crash when we had only one NFNT font installed?
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This patch would cause ConstructNFNTDirectory to always overwrite the buffer<br>
passed in. But that wouldn't always cause your machine to freak out. By adding enough<br>
NFNT fonts, we trashed the QuickDraw GX heap significantly enough to cause the crash.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, all this and it was an application patch that caused the problem! It sure<br>
would have been cool if we could have used the <b>patch</b> dcmd.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. The <b>patch</b> dcmd does works on the Power Mac -- but we didn't know that<br>
was the problem when we started.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> It's interesting that it was an application bug. That would explain why I crash in<br>
a spreadsheet application by the same company. They share the same patch.
</p>
<p>
<b>cam</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasty.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dave</b> Yeah.
