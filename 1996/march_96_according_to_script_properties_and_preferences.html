<i>On the way to implementing scripting support in your applications, you're bound to</i><br>
<i>confront a variety of issues. In this column, I'll give you some pointers for devising</i><br>
<i>and testing property names and discuss the techniques for handling preferences</i><br>
<i>through scripting.</i>
</p>
<h2>PROPERTIES</h2>
<p>
In an application's scripting vocabulary, a property is an attribute of an object.<br>
Properties can replace variables in <b>if</b> and <b>repeat</b> statements, as well as in<br>
expressions, and a script writer normally uses the AppleScript verbs set and get with<br>
them. Here I'll give some guidelines for coming up with human-language names for<br>
properties and testing the viability of those names within the overall natural style of<br>
the AppleScript language. It's important that properties have names that users can<br>
easily become familiar with. Ideally, users should be able to refer to properties in a<br>
script the way they think or speak about them.
</p>
<p>
<b>Don't start property names with verbs. </b>Starting property names with verbs<br>
leads to confusion when the property appears in the middle of a sentence. For example,<br>
naming a property <b>disable call waiting</b> leads to commands that don't read smoothly:
</p>
<pre>set disable call waiting to true
if disable call waiting then ...</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This is somewhat clearer:
</p>
<pre>set call waiting enabled to false
if not call waiting enabled ...</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In fact, in the above case, it would be even better to name the property <b>call waiting</b><br>
and use an enumeration as its value type (for a discussion of enumerations, see my<br>
article "Designing a Scripting Implementation" in <i>develop</i>Issue 21). The choices<br>
<b>enabled</b> and <b>disabled</b> allow grammatically correct sentences, as in the following:
</p>
<pre>set call waiting to enabled
if call waiting is disabled ...</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
A little creative thinking goes a long way in making it easy for users to work with the<br>
language.
</p>
<p>
<b>The "the" test.</b> AppleScript allows you to add or remove the word <b>the</b> almost<br>
anywhere in a script without changing the meaning of the script. Many script writers<br>
precede object and property names with the word <b>the</b> to make their scripts easier to<br>
read. Writing your test scripts in this way helps you determine the degree to which<br>
your property names facilitate forming natural sentences.
</p>
<pre>set the service to "America Online"
if the priority is high then ...</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Don't confuse attributes and actions.</b> Sometimes setting a property can cause an<br>
immediate change on the screen. In deciding whether to use a property in this<br>
situation, a helpful rule is: When an <i>action is initiated</i>, use a verb; when an attribute<br>
changes (even if it produces immediate visible results), use a property. Another way<br>
of looking at this is if a visible change is immediate, it's OK to use a property, but if an<br>
action has a duration, use a verb.
</p>
<p>
As an example, the following command causes an immediate change on the screen:
</p>
<pre>set the font of the third paragraph to "Courier"</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Even though setting the <b>font</b> property creates a visible change, the font is still an<br>
attribute of the text, not an action. On the other hand, naming a property or<br>
enumerator <b>playing</b>, as shown in the next two commands, is a poor choice, because<br>
<b>playing</b> actually initiates an action:
</p>
<pre>set playing to true  
set [the] status to playing  </pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The<b>playing</b> enumerator value in the second command is fine for obtaining state<br>
information, but a<b> status</b> property should be read-only. Instead of creating a<br>
property to control an action, use a verb. Verbs such as <b>play </b>or <b>start playing</b>are<br>
better suited for actions, as shown here:
</p>
<pre>play the movie "Wowie Zowie"
start playing the movie "Wowie Zowie"</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Note that the commands are <b>play</b> and <b>start playing,</b> not <b>play movie</b> or <b>start</b><br>
<b>playing movie</b>. In an application based on the object model, <b>movie</b> would be an<br>
object class.
</p>
<p>
<b>The properties property.</b> A <b>properties</b> property enables script writers to<br>
obtain all the properties for a given object in the form of a record by using a<br>
get<b>properties</b> construct. (I first suggested using records in this column in<i>develop</i><br>
Issue 22.) The <b>properties </b>property can also be set with the set command. The<br>
sample <b>properties</b> property shown in Listing 1 can be included as a property of any<br>
object for which you allow the setting of more than one property at a time.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1.</b> A sample properties property
</p>
<pre>{   /* array Properties: 5 elements */
   /* [5] */
   "properties",
   'Prop',
   'reco',
   "Property that allows setting of a list
      of properties.",
   reserved, singleItem, notEnumerated,
   readWrite, reserved,
   ...
},</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Don't require the user to supply all the properties when setting the properties<br>
property -- allow the setting of just one or a few properties.
</p>
<pre>get the properties of the fourth paragraph
   -- returns font, size, style, and so on
set the properties of the fourth paragraph to ~
   {font:"Helvetica", size:14}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>PREFERENCES</h2>
<p>
Developers use a variety of techniques to allow users to set preferences through<br>
scripts. I'll describe three common and easily implemented approaches for dealing<br>
with preference properties in your application class. (These same approaches can be<br>
used to implement document settings or group properties for individual objects within<br>
your application.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Separate properties for each preference</b>. Implementing preferences as<br>
individual properties works well when you have only a few preferences. For example:
</p>
<pre>set the connect sound to "Shriek"
set the receive folder to alias "HD:Drop Folder"</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you have many preferences, it's inefficient for the user to have to set each property<br>
individually. To solve this, you can implement your preferences as individual<br>
properties (usually in your vocabulary's application class definition) and also include<br>
a <b>preferences</b> property, described next.
</p>
<p>
<b>A property that includes all the preferences.</b> You can make a single<br>
<b>preferences</b>or <b>settings</b> property, which is a record that's defined elsewhere in<br>
your vocabulary. To define the elements of the record, create a fake "class" in your<br>
vocabulary, preferably in your Type Definitions Suite, to serve as the definition of the<br>
element labels in a record definition. In the comment field for your "class," be sure to<br>
document clearly that this is a record definition, not an object class. Listing 2<br>
illustrates this technique; for more information, see the section "Define Record Labels<br>
in a Record Definition" in "Designing a Scripting Implementation" in <i>develop</i> Issue 21.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 2.</b> A sample preferences property
</p>
<pre>/* First, define this application property. */
{   /* array Properties: 5 elements */
   /* [5] */
   "preferences",
   'Pref',  
   'cprf,      /* for "preferences class" */
   "Property that allows setting some or all
      of your preferences.",
   reserved, singleItem, notEnumerated,
   readWrite, reserved,
   ...      /* more reserved items */
},
... /* more property definitions */

/* Later, in your Type Definitions Suite, */
/* create a fake class. */
{   /* array Classes: 1 element */
/* [1] */
"preferences record",
'cprf',
"A record containing individual preferences",
{   /* array Properties: 10 elements */
   /* [1] */
   "connect sound", 'CSND', 'itxt',
   "the name of the sound to use when
      connected",
   reserved, singleItem, notEnumerated,
   ...
   /* [2] */
   "receive folder", 'RFLD', 'alis',
   "the folder to place files when received",
   reserved, singleItem, notEnumerated,
   ...
},
{   /* array Elements: 0 elements */
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Lists and records are the two principal constructs in AppleScript that don't lend<br>
themselves to human sentence structure. They are, however, an integral part of the<br>
language and can occasionally help to make the script writer's life easier. When you<br>
use a record to create a <b>preferences</b> property, it's OK to stray a little from strict<br>
natural-language style. Of course, when referring to elements of a list or record, you<br>
should use natural-language style.
</p>
<p>
As with the <b>properties</b> property described earlier, don't require the user to set all<br>
the individual preferences at once. Allow the setting of just one or a few preferences at<br>
a time:
</p>
<pre>set the preferences to ~
   {connect sound:"Shriek", ~
    receive folder:alias "HD:Drop folder"}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
A user can address individual preferences as if they were defined as separate<br>
application properties. To allow for varying user experience with AppleScript, your<br>
application should always accept property specifications for individual preferences<br>
using the technique described above, regardless of whether the user includes the<br>
qualifying phrase of the preferences. For example, both of the following statements<br>
should be allowed:
</p>
<pre>set the receive folder of the preferences to ~
   alias "HD:Drop Folder"
set the receive folder to alias "HD:Drop Folder"</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Multiple "group" properties for grouping preferences. </b>If you have many<br>
preferences or want to group the preferences according to similar functionality, such<br>
as those often found in multipaneled dialog boxes, you can create separate properties<br>
for groups of preferences or settings (using the record definition technique just<br>
described). The properties can reflect the groupings you've set up in your graphical<br>
interface:
</p>
<pre>set the compiler preferences to ~
   {warnings included:true, ~
   default integer size:short integer}

set the drawing settings to ~
   {pen size:{1,2}, shape:circle}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
A user addresses an individual preference by including in the object property<br>
specification the record that the preference is an element of, as follows:
</p>
<pre>the pen size of the drawing settings
set the shape of the drawing settings to ~
   rectangle
set the default integer size of the compiler ~
   preferences to short integer</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>PARTING WORDS</h2>
<p>
Following these guidelines in implementing scriptability in your applications makes it<br>
easier for users to write scripts. Although they may seem like small points, it's the<br>
details that mean the difference between frustration and smooth sailing for the script<br>
writer. Remember to think about the way a user would write or speak about<br>
accomplishing what they want to do. Until next time, I remain your obedient servant on<br>
the AppleScript front. I'll see you on applescript-implementors@abs.apple.com, the<br>
mailing list for scriptability.
