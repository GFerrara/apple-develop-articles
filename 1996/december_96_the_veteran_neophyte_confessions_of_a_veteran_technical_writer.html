<p>
I've been a technical writer long enough to have learned a few trade secrets, if you<br>
will, that guide me in my daily work and (sometimes, I hope) help me to do it a little<br>
better. Whether you're reading manuals for content, working with technical writers to<br>
document your own software, or even writing documentation yourself, understanding<br>
these secrets might be of value to you. I've long had it in mind to write a book about<br>
these and other topics, sort of a general discourse on technical thought and how to do it<br>
better. Until I actually write that book, however, the following confessions will have<br>
to do.
</p>
<p>
These confessions should help you understand some of the tasks that some technical<br>
writers typically perform and some of the conflicting forces that shape final<br>
documents. (Note the profusion of the word <i>some</i>: your mileage may vary.) For fun --<br>
and for another reason that I won't tell you yet -- each confession is introduced by an<br>
appropriate palindrome (a word or phrase that reads the same forward and backward).
</p>


<h2>MADAM, I'M ADAM</h2>
<p>
As you probably know, Adam was given the task of naming the plants and animals. In a<br>
way, Adam was the first technical writer, for an important part of technical writing is<br>
to systematize and regularize the nomenclature used in some specific area of interest.<br>
It's rare for the engineers developing software to pay very close attention to naming<br>
issues. Indeed, the rule is quite the contrary: more often than not, the technical<br>
specifications written by engineers are rife with conflicting, inconsistent vocabulary.<br>
It nearly always falls to the writers and their editors to clean things up and present<br>
the technology using clear, regular, and concise terminology.
</p>
<p>
There's a moderately foolproof way to discern which writers take this job seriously<br>
and which do not: just look at a document's glossary. For my money, every draft of<br>
every technical document should include a robust glossary that defines the special<br>
terms and concepts used in the document. You simply cannot write any significant part<br>
of a technical document without grappling with naming issues. A working, growing<br>
glossary is the writer's proof that he or she is actively thinking about these issues and<br>
is developing a preferred vocabulary to describe the technology being documented.
</p>
<p>
Don't be misled by the fact that the glossary is usually one of the last items in a book:<br>
as I see it, the glossary ought to be written concurrently with the book, not after it.<br>
(The index is another issue altogether: a book cannot be properly indexed until it's<br>
nearing completion. Trying to do an index while a document is still changing usually<br>
results in tremendous frustration.)
</p>


<h2>SUE US, ONO, SUE US!</h2>
<p>
At some point in the distant past, Apple Computer reached an agreement with the<br>
Beatle's record company, Apple Records, that allowed Apple Computer to use the name<br>
"Apple" so long as it did not engage in certain markets, such as music recording. At<br>
some later point in the distant past, Apple Records sued Apple Computer, alleging<br>
certain violations of that agreement. Suddenly, the lawyers at Apple Computer were<br>
intensely interested in the sound and music capabilities of the Macintosh hardware and<br>
system software.
</p>
<p>
At that moment, I happened to be finishing up the Sound Manager chapter of<i>Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i> Volume VI. Apple's lawyers decided that a number of API elements smacked<br>
too much of music and needed therefore to be changed. For instance, it was thought that<br>
since music is composed of individual notes, the word <i>note</i> should not occur anywhere<br>
in the documentation in any sound-related sense. As a result, what was hitherto known<br>
as the noteCmd constant was changed to freqDurationCmd (the idea being that playing a<br>
note is just playing a frequency for a specific duration). The legal department<br>
demanded a number of other changes, which led to some last-minute rewriting and<br>
reindexing as the book neared publication. And, of course, the engineers had to issue<br>
new header files to reflect the new names.
</p>
<p>
I don't imagine that Yoko Ono and other Apple Records executives have spent much time<br>
reading <i>Inside Macintosh</i>, so I doubt that my efforts were all that critical. Nonetheless,<br>
I learned my lesson. I confess: I've come to appreciate the difficult job done by the<br>
Apple legal department. I now pay close attention to the lists of trademarks distributed<br>
by the editors in our department, and I'm constantly on the lookout for API elements<br>
that might step on someone's copyrighted toes.
</p>


<h2>YAWN WAY</h2>
<p>
Let's face it: technical writing isn't creative writing. It's not designed to enthrall, just<br>
to educate and to serve as a useful reference during your daily work. To be useful, a<br>
technical document has to be complete. It also has to be consistent in style and<br>
vocabulary with other similar documents -- in my case, with other <i>Inside Macintosh</i><br>
books. ("No manual is an island.") Providing documents that are both complete and<br>
consistent usually means following a pretty strict set of rules and guidelines governing<br>
the style, organization, and content of the document. It can get to be drudgery,<br>
sometimes. Yawn.
</p>
<p>
On the upside, having rules and other established methods to follow can be incredibly<br>
liberating. These shackles free you from constantly having to rethink major issues<br>
about a document you're writing. Once you figure out what goes where, in a general<br>
sense, you almost don't need to think any more. You just take the API elements that<br>
need documenting, plug them into the correct paragraph formats, and fill in the<br>
appropriate information. It can get to be too easy, sometimes. Yawn.
</p>
<p>
Following rules, though laudable, is not without its own problems. The requirement<br>
that every constant in an API be precisely described can result in some pretty silly<br>
stuff. For instance, page 2-33 in the book <i>Inside Macintosh: PowerPC System Software</i><br>
takes the trouble to inform us that the constant kRegisterD0 stands for the register<br>
D0. Did anyone have any doubt about that? It can get to be too dumb, sometimes. Yawn.
</p>
<p>
Have we reached the stage where the API is self-documenting, where just the names of<br>
functions and constants give us all the information we need to use them effectively? I<br>
don't think so. It's just plain dangerous to start having writers decide what's too<br>
obvious to need description and what isn't. In my mind, every element of an API should<br>
be fully documented, even if we end up with a few odd cases where there really is<br>
nothing more to say. Remember, degenerate cases like these are a direct result of<br>
systematically applying rules and established methods. They're a clear signal that the<br>
writer is doing things exactly right.
</p>


<h2>IF I HAD A HI-FI...</h2>
<p>
...I'd play it real loud, and I'd turn the bass way up. That's the only way to play reggae<br>
music, which is what I listen to mostly. My taste in music is quirky, but that's a<br>
problem of mine generally. I confess: I adopt methods that help me get my work done,<br>
even if those methods are quirky. I revel in quirks, because they often pay off.
</p>
<p>
So I'll confess another quirk of mine: I write my documents backward. For each<br>
chapter, I start at the end and write the summary first. This actually makes good<br>
sense, since what I'm documenting is usually an API, as defined by a header file. The<br>
summary is really just an improved header file. It's improved in part because it<br>
attempts to impart more order and consistency than you'll find in a typical header file.<br>
It's important to keep in mind that header files are designed for compilers, not for<br>
humans. There's lots of junk in these files that has absolutely no meaning to a<br>
programmer. The summary provides an ordered distillation of the header file to its<br>
key components.
</p>
<p>
Once I've written my summary, I have a good head start on the reference section. That's<br>
because the summary already contains intelligent groupings and orderings for the<br>
basic language elements. To write the reference section, I simply need to "fill in the<br>
blanks" provided by the summary: Each constant needs a precise definition. Each data<br>
structure needs to have its use explained, and each of its fields must be fully described.<br>
Each function has parameters that need describing, and it probably returns a value<br>
that must be described.
</p>
<p>
Only when I've finished the summary and reference sections do I even think about the<br>
first parts of the chapter, the About and Using sections. At that point, I need to turn<br>
down the music and do some real thinking.
</p>


<h2>GOD? DOG?</h2>
<p>
Good technical writing is far too often simply taken for granted. Partly that's an<br>
occupational hazard: when it's done right, good documentation is unobtrusive: it<br>
purposely doesn't try to be cheeky or clever. More important, good technical writing<br>
is unobtrusive because it doesn't jar the reader with confusing organization, sloppy<br>
diction, or bad transitions from one topic to the next. Its job is to conform to<br>
established styles and norms, and to present information as straightforwardly and<br>
clearly as possible. Nonetheless, it bugs me that I've never seen a single review of any<br>
<i>Inside Macintosh</i> book. Even magazines that are geared specifically at Macintosh<br>
programmers, like <i>MacTech Magazine</i>, never actually bother to review these<br>
important books. Third-party books get plenty of discussion, but not the primary<br>
documents they all draw on.
</p>
<p>
I see some other signs that technical writing is taken for granted -- like product<br>
managers who try to bring a writer onto a project two weeks before the CDs are to be<br>
pressed, and engineers who would rather have a root canal than review the chapter<br>
describing the technology they've slaved over for months or perhaps years. What these<br>
people are missing is that good documentation can add a considerable amount of value to<br>
an engineering product. Documentation is the first and most important bridge between<br>
the engineers and the developers using their technology. If the documentation paints a<br>
compelling reason to adopt the technology and facilitates that adoption by providing<br>
useful sample code and complete descriptions of the API, the writer is a god.<br>
Occasionally, the "wow" factor emerges: documentation that is so compelling that it<br>
opens your eyes wider and makes your fingers itchy for some coding.
</p>
<p>
The flip side of the "wow" factor is the "dud" factor: documentation that is so patently<br>
bad it almost single-handedly ensures limited adoption for the technology it describes.<br>
I've seen some really good technologies languish for years, for no other discernible<br>
reason than that they're tied to some really lousy documentation. The best software<br>
technology and the best API cannot survive a mauling by a dog technical writer.
</p>


<h2>"OTTO," MY MOTTO</h2>
<p>
Palindromes delight us because they call attention to a fairly rare phenomenon: a<br>
sequence of letters that is meaningful and that reads the same forward or backward.<br>
Language wasn't designed to be palindromic, and there is no cognitive benefit -- no<br>
additional information -- in a particular phrase or sentence that happens to be<br>
reversible. It's usually a serendipitous accident that some long sentence should be<br>
palindromic.
</p>
<p>
At their best, palindromes tweak our sense of order. As I've suggested above, order<br>
itself is deceptive. The linear order of presentation that you find in technical<br>
documentation like <i>Inside Macintosh</i> reflects, in all likelihood, neither the order in<br>
which the document was written nor the order in which you're most likely to access<br>
the information in it. In fact, the principle according to which most good documentation<br>
is organized is a complex hybrid of at least two ordering schemes.
</p>
<p>
On one hand, there is a principle governing how you should be able to learn from a<br>
document: you should be able to pick up a document (a book or a chapter) and read it<br>
from start to finish with good comprehension. Concepts should be explained in a clear,<br>
cumulative order, and tasks should be explained in the order they need to be<br>
performed. I like to call this a <i>pedagogically linear</i>path through the document. The good<br>
writer progressively reveals more and more of the technology as he or she goes along.<br>
This is the main principle that governs the opening sections of an <i>Inside Macintosh</i><br>
chapter (the About and Using sections).
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, there is a principle governing how you should be able to find<br>
information in a document. Technical documentation is, above all, a type of reference<br>
material. You're constantly jumping into the middle of a chapter to find the meaning of<br>
a constant, or the type of a parameter to a function, or some similar piece of<br>
information. It's common to call this <i>random access</i> to the information, but I prefer to<br>
avoid that term, since it might suggest that the information itself is ordered randomly.<br>
In my opinion, pure reference material (such as that found in the reference and<br>
summary sections of <i>Inside Mac</i> chapters) must be organized hierarchically, where<br>
the items are intelligently divided into groups, which are themselves further<br>
subdivided into groups, until every item can be reached by a meaningful path from the<br>
top of the hierarchy. I like to call this the <i>hierarchically linear</i> path to the<br>
information. (For reference material, the main competitor to a hierarchical<br>
organization is the standard alphabetical organization, which some of you might<br>
prefer. Personally, I like to have things grouped by functional similarity, not ordered<br>
-- "one darn thing after another" -- by name.)
</p>
<p>
The pedagogical order and the hierarchical order are clearly different ways of<br>
organizing information. If you follow a pedagogical path, you might not get where you<br>
want to go very quickly, but you'll get a complete picture of the terrain as you pass<br>
through it. If you follow a hierarchical path, you can get where you want to go pretty<br>
quickly, but only if you already know where you're going. So, to use the hierarchical<br>
path, you must already have traveled the pedagogical path. These two ordering<br>
principles depend on each other and should never be separated.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, order dominates my mind, at least when I'm writing technical<br>
documentation. That's why my motto is a palindrome. Attention to order -- and clearly<br>
understanding exactly what kind of order is relevant to the task at hand -- is the<br>
foundation of all good technical writing.
