<i>Last issue's column discussed various ways of using ToolServer. I looked forward to</i><br>
<i>deeper integration of MPW scripts into other development systems, in a stirring plea</i><br>
<i>that must have brought tears to the eyes of many an overly sensitive reader. In this</i><br>
<i>column, I'll show just how self-fulfilling a prophecy can be: I'll explain how to use a</i><br>
<i>generic ToolServer plug-in compiler with the popular Metrowerks CodeWarrior</i><br>
<i>development system.</i>
</p>
<h2>BEYOND THE WORKSHEET</h2>
<p>
CodeWarrior already comes with ToolServer support in the form of an integrated<br>
Worksheet window, similar to the MPW Shell Worksheet. Simply choose Start<br>
ToolServer from the Tools menu and you can issue all kinds of shell commands. It's like<br>
a miniature MPW Shell inside CodeWarrior. What more could you ask for?
</p>
<p>
Ten bonus points for reading skills if you could tell that that wasn't really a rhetorical<br>
question. The Worksheet is useful but it falls short of full integration. True, you can<br>
execute a Make command from CodeWarrior's Worksheet, but it would be even better<br>
to integrate MPW tools and scripts into the default CodeWarrior build sequence.
</p>
<p>
Let's say you have a SOM build -- that is, you're using IBM's System Object Model as<br>
implemented on the Macintosh in the form of "SOMObjects for MacOS(TM)". Before too<br>
long, it's likely that the current preprocessing approach to SOM will be just a fading<br>
(though still traumatic) memory, and that CodeWarrior and MPW will have<br>
direct-to-SOM compilers. For now, though, building with SOM requires running MPW<br>
tools and scripts to generate include files which are then processed by the C or C++<br>
compiler.
</p>
<p>
Error prevention is one of the basic principles of user friendliness. You can invoke the<br>
SOM compiler from a makefile and run it in the CodeWarrior worksheet before you<br>
build, but if you're like me, short-term memory loss from a misspent youth will<br>
cause you to forget to run the makefile from time to time, leading to bizarre errors<br>
and gratuitous hair-tearing behaviors. MPW makefiles provide another rich source of<br>
errors by requiring you to track your own include files.
</p>
<p>
It's more convenient to simply give the single menu command Make than to bring up<br>
the Worksheet, enter "BuildProgram MyBuildFile", wait for the build to finish, and<br>
then give the Make menu command. One could only wish that CodeWarrior had a<br>
built-in SOM compiler.
</p>
<h2>A BUILT-IN SOM COMPILER (AND MORE)</h2>
<p>
Thanks to CodeWarrior's new plug-in compiler architecture (available starting with<br>
CW7), you can add build rules that invoke ToolServer scripts automatically to compile<br>
".idl" files, or any other type of file. I've created a generic ToolServer plug-in for<br>
CodeWarrior (found on this issue's CD) that allows you to set up different command<br>
lines for different filename extensions. It will automatically track include files as<br>
well, if you want it to. It should be powerful enough for most applications, but if you<br>
need something different, you can take the source code and hack it endlessly to your<br>
own nefarious purposes.
</p>
<p>
To install the plug-in compiler, put the compiler file ToolFrontEnd into the Compilers<br>
folder of the CodeWarrior Plugins folder of your CodeWarrior application folder, and<br>
the preferences file ToolFrontEnd Panel into the Preferences folder of CodeWarrior<br>
Plugins. To set it up, first decide which filename extensions you want to run through<br>
ToolServer; in this example, we'll be doing the ".idl" files used by SOM. Give the<br>
Preferences menu command in CodeWarrior, go to the Targets panel, and attach the<br>
ToolFrontEnd compiler to source files of the appropriate type and extension.
</p>
<p>
Finally, go to the new ToolFrontEnd panel in Preferences and enter the command line<br>
you want to execute for files of this extension. The ToolFrontEnd panel is shown in<br>
Figure 1. Like all software, this is a work in progress, so it may look slightly<br>
different by the time it reaches you.
</p>

</p>
<p>
The pop-up menu allows you to enter different commands for different filename<br>
extensions. Bind each extension to the ToolFrontEnd compiler from the Target panel.
</p>
<p>
The Script Include File will be executed before your command line. This lets you set up<br>
variables and aliases that may be useful for your scripts and tools. The&nbsp;&nbsp;same include<br>
file is used for all filename extensions. The include file can be anywhere in the<br>
project's&nbsp;&nbsp;access paths. Here I'm using an include file named "cwtsinclude," which sets<br>
up a few handy variables.&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't need to specify any include file if you don't want<br>
one.
</p>
<p>
Your source file can be preprocessed to find include files. I've provided a default<br>
preprocessor that deals with <b>#include</b> specifications. You can add other<br>
preprocessors -- see the documentation and sample code that come with the software.<br>
Each include file will be added to CodeWarrior's internal list of dependencies for the<br>
source file, so the source file will automatically be rebuilt when an include file<br>
changes. If you don't want to scan for include files, choose None from the pop-up menu.
</p>
<p>
All include files should be in the CodeWarrior project's access paths. The project's<br>
access paths will be combined into the IncludeFiles variable, prefixed with the Path<br>
Parameter shown in the panel. This variable is available to all scripts executed from<br>
the plug-in.
</p>
<p>
All commands will be executed in the ToolServer context, so they'll use any startup<br>
scripts you've installed. See the notes from last issue's column&nbsp;&nbsp;about minimizing<br>
dependencies, though; all your requirements should be fulfilled by files you explicitly<br>
execute or by the Script Include File specified in the panel. Otherwise you'll run into<br>
configuration synchronization problems when restoring archived builds or sharing<br>
sources with your team members.
</p>
<p>
When the plug-in compiler executes scripts, ToolServer's current directory will have<br>
been set to the folder containing the project file. The following variables&nbsp;&nbsp;will be set<br>
up:
</p>
<ul>
<li>{IncludeFiles} -- the parameterized include path list</li>
<li>{ProjectFolder} -- the full pathname of the folder containing the current<br>
project file</li>
<li>{SourceFile} -- the full pathname of the source file being compiled</li>
<li>{SourceFileStem} -- the root or stem of the</li>
<li>name of the source file (for instance, the stem of "MyPanels.idl" would be<br>
"MyPanels")</li>
</ul>
<p>
Generally speaking, you'll probably want to create a front-end script for the plug-in<br>
compiler, rather than enter a raw MPW command line in the panel. This allows you to<br>
specify any number of parameters, redirections, and so on in a script file without<br>
worrying about the text editing limits in the modal dialog. The command line you<br>
specify can be up to 255 characters long. The SOM compiler has a lot of options, so I've<br>
put all the ones I use into a script file named "cwsomc."
</p>
<p>
All diagnostic output will appear in the CodeWarrior error window. All standard<br>
output will be ignored. Internal errors in the plug-in will appear as alerts.
</p>
<p>
Due to a limitation in the current plug-in API, CodeWarrior doesn't know about<br>
dependencies involving compilers that put out source files. While the SOM compiler<br>
will emit, for instance, a ".xh" include file that will be included by a ".cp" file later in<br>
the build process, there is currently no way for CodeWarrior to know that the ".cp"<br>
file depends on the ".idl" file from which the ".xh" file was generated. This will be<br>
fixed in a future version of the API, and I'll add functionality to the ToolFrontEnd<br>
plug-in to support this feature when it becomes available. For now, since<br>
CodeWarrior compiles files in the order they appear in the project file, just put ".idl"<br>
files above ".cp" files.
</p>
<h2>UNDER THE HOOD</h2>
<p>
Source code is provided with ToolFrontEnd, so you can get a detailed peek at its insides<br>
and mutate it to your own needs. A quick overview may be useful here, though.
</p>
<p>
ToolFrontEnd sends commands to ToolServer in the form of Apple events, as described<br>
in last issue's column. It builds a command in memory that is a short multiline script<br>
with semicolons separating the commands. The last command of this script is the one<br>
you typed in&nbsp;&nbsp;the preferences panel. At the start of the script are commands that set the<br>
four variables described above. The diagnostic output is extracted from the 'diag'<br>
parameter of the reply Apple event returned from ToolServer, and the error code is<br>
extracted from the 'stat' parameter. All this is done using a slightly modified version<br>
of the sample code for communicating with SourceServer that I provided in this<br>
column in Issue 23; the Apple event conventions of SourceServer and ToolServer are<br>
much the same.
</p>
<p>
The plug-in was built by starting with the sample code provided with CodeWarrior. I<br>
didn't have to make any large-scale changes to the structure -- Metrowerks deserves<br>
kudos for the quality of their sample code and their clean API. There are two code<br>
modules to be built, one for the preferences panel and one for the compiler itself.<br>
Library routines are provided for common operations like registering a dependency<br>
and getting a stored preferences record. The sample compiler already contained an<br>
include file parser, which I broke out into a separate module to allow customization<br>
for different file types.
</p>
<h2>THE BEST OF TWO WORLDS</h2>
<p>
Though I've shown just one example, many different things can be done with the<br>
ToolFrontEnd plug-in. One of my friends is using a third-party version of the<br>
UNIX(TM) tool yacc (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler), which is delivered as an MPW<br>
tool. Thanks to this plug-in, he no longer has to switch between the MPW Shell and<br>
CodeWarrior constantly. You could also define your own macro language to preprocess<br>
your source files, or add your own original compilers. And of course, using ToolServer<br>
scripts from the compiler is fully compatible with using the CodeWarrior ToolServer<br>
Worksheet window for other tasks such as installing software. The Worksheet is also<br>
useful for testing and debugging scripts you'll use with ToolFrontEnd. I haven't<br>
provided a linker plug-in, but the API is similar and the compiler plug-in could<br>
easily be adapted to&nbsp;&nbsp;this purpose.
</p>
<p>
With ToolFrontEnd, the friendliness of CodeWarrior and the power of MPW celebrate a<br>
hieros gamos (or sacred union, if that's Greek to you). The fruit of this union is an<br>
all-in-one development environment from which you can execute your entire build<br>
process, no matter how complicated, without changing contexts&nbsp;&nbsp;or inviting errors.<br>
Those whose souls are devoid of romance may prefer to contemplate the consequences of<br>
increased productivity for their next performance review -- in either case, enjoy in<br>
good humor and&nbsp;&nbsp;good health!
