<p>
In this column in Issue 26 of <i>develop</i>, I showed you a wide range of scriptable editing<br>
commands available from the MPW Shell. This time I'll discuss a single tool that<br>
provides a powerful self-contained text-editing scripting language, StreamEdit.
</p>
<p>
Why would you want to use StreamEdit instead of the other text-editing features of the<br>
MPW Shell?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance -- A StreamEdit script is faster than an MPW script<br>
containing various Replace and Find commands.</li>
<li>Self-containment -- Because StreamEdit is a self-contained tool, you can<br>
run it from within ToolServer, unlike the scriptable editing commands<br>
discussed in Issue 26, which are available only in the MPW Shell itself. This<br>
means you can use StreamEdit to create lightweight drag-and-drop grinder<br>
AppleScript scripts that send StreamEdit commands to ToolServer.</li>
<li>Consistency -- Keeping all your editing in a single scripting language<br>
confers the elusive mystical boon of code consistency, making your system<br>
easier to maintain and modify in the future.</li>
</ul>


<h2>GETTING TO KNOW YOU</h2>
<p>
StreamEdit is based very closely on the hoary UNIX tool named <b>sed</b>. If you already<br>
know <b>sed</b>, much of this will be familiar, but StreamEdit isn't directly compatible with<br>
<b>sed</b> scripts.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An MPW version of sed</b> is available as part of the GNU free software<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;project. One place you can find it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ishttp://sunsite.cnam.fr/packages/gnu/cygnus/mac/.*
</p>
<p>
StreamEdit implements a pattern-matching language. Every time a particular pattern<br>
is matched, a sequence of commands will be executed. As in most pattern-matching<br>
languages, StreamEdit's scripts are lists of pattern/command pairs, with the pattern<br>
coming before the command. The input file or files are read through the script<br>
interpreter, which searches for instances of the patterns and executes the<br>
corresponding commands. Anything that doesn't match a pattern is passed through<br>
unchanged.
</p>
<p>
StreamEdit scans one line at a time through the input, matching its current line to<br>
every pattern in its script. After processing each line, it writes out the modified line.<br>
The result is a concatenation of three internal buffers: the<i>insert buffer</i>, then the <i>edit</i><br>
<i>buffer</i>, and finally the <i>append buffer</i>. The edit buffer gets filled with the current line,<br>
while the other buffers are empty at the start. The Insert and Append commands place<br>
text in the insert and append buffers, allowing you to add text to the beginning and end<br>
of the output line. The Change, Delete, and Replace commands modify the contents of the<br>
edit buffer.
</p>


<h2>SHARING ADDRESSES</h2>
<p>
As usual, MPW uses words in ways previously unknown in human speech. In<br>
StreamEdit, patterns are referred to as "addresses." There are two kinds of addresses:<br>
line numbers and regular expressions. Line numbers ought to be self-explanatory, but<br>
it may help to note that the numbers must be Arabic numerals rather than Roman, and<br>
must be in base 10 rather than the hexadecimal or sexagesimal number systems.<br>
There are three special line numbers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the bullet symbol (<b>&#8721;</b>, Option-8), meaning the point before the first line<br>
(enabling you to add a line before the first line, for example)</li>
<li>the infinity symbol (Option-5), meaning the point after the last line</li>
<li>dollar sign ($), meaning the last line</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The keyboard shortcuts</b>, as always in this column, are for American<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QWERTY keyboards; if you've got some other type of keyboard, you're on your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own.*
</p>
<p>
Regular expressions are expressions that manage their diets sensibly. They can be<br>
used for searching, and were explained in detail in Issue 26. In StreamEdit addresses,<br>
though, regular expressions find the entire line containing the pattern, rather than<br>
just the pattern. Regular expressions are denoted by slashes. Only forward slashes are<br>
used (StreamEdit doesn't have a backward search mode, having been frightened at an<br>
early age by the legends of Eurydice and Lot's wife). Three new constructs have been<br>
added to regular expressions in StreamEdit:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>&#231;</b> (Option-C), which indicates a case-sensitive search</li>
<li>// (two slashes), which means the last regular expression that was<br>
matched</li>
<li> &lt;=<i>variable</i>&gt;= (a variable name embedded in inequality operators, here<br>
overloaded as a special kind of angle brackets, and typed as Option-comma and<br>
Option-period), which means the text of an expanded StreamEdit variable,<br>
treated as literal text to be matched rather than as a regular expression</li>
</ul>
<p>
StreamEdit has variables that can be set with the Set command (more on this later) or<br>
from the command line using the <b>-set</b><i>variable</i> [<b>=</b><i>value</i>] option.
</p>
<p>
You can form more complex addresses using a few operators. The Boolean and, or, and<br>
not operators are the same as in C (<b>&amp;&amp;</b>, | |, and <b>!</b>, respectively). Parentheses can be<br>
used for grouping within addresses. The comma operator matches the range of lines<br>
specified; for example, <b>3,5</b> matches lines 3 through 5. A range address matches each<br>
of the lines in the range, if any. It can be thought of as matching more than once: it<br>
fires off the accompanying command on the first line matched, the last one matched,<br>
and all lines in between. If the termination condition is never met, the address<br>
continues to match until the end of input. This could happen if you specify a range of<br>
lines ending at line 15, for instance, and there are only ten lines in the file, or if your<br>
range termination condition is a regular expression that doesn't appear anywhere in<br>
the input.
</p>


<h2>TAKING ACTION</h2>
<p>
Matching patterns is very nice, but what do you do once you match them? Statements<br>
in StreamEdit attach actions to patterns. An action consists of one or more commands,<br>
separated by semicolons or by the end of a line. There's no begin or end bracketing as<br>
in Pascal or C. Addresses and commands are syntactically distinct, so the script<br>
interpreter can figure out where the list of commands for a pattern ends and the next<br>
pattern begins.
</p>
<p>
<b>Editing commands</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Insert</b><i>text</i> [<b>-n</b>] -- Adds the specified text to the start of the line by<br>
putting it in the insert buffer. The <b>-n</b> option (in this command and in Append<br>
and Change) prevents adding a newline character when the line is written out.</li>
<li><b>Append</b><i>text</i> [<b>-n</b>] -- Adds the specified text to the end of the line by<br>
putting it in the append buffer.</li>
<li><b>Change</b><i>text</i> [<b>-n</b>] -- Changes the line to the specified text by replacing<br>
the contents of the edit buffer.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- Clears the edit buffer.</li>
<li><b>Replace</b> [<b>-c</b><i>count</i>] /<i>pattern</i>/ <i>text</i> -- Replaces the pattern with the<br>
specified text. This is the second part of a two-step matching process: first the<br>
address matches a line, then Replace searches in the edit buffer and replaces<br>
the pattern. The count argument indicates the maximum number of times to<br>
perform the replacement in the line. It can be a positive integer or infinity.<br>
The default count is 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Control commands</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Exit</b> [<i>status</i>] -- Stops StreamEdit with the given error status. The<br>
default is 0, which means execution completed with no errors. Any nonzero<br>
error status indicates a problem, and unless the built-in MPW variable Exit<br>
is set to something other than 0, this will stop execution of the script (if any)<br>
from which the StreamEdit command was executed.</li>
<li><b>Next</b> -- Somewhat like the C keyword continue. When a Next command is<br>
executed, all pending changes are written out and no more addresses are<br>
matched against the current line; that is, StreamEdit immediately goes on to<br>
the next line without matching the rest of the rules against the current edit<br>
buffer.</li>
<li><b>Set</b><i>variable text</i> [<b>-i</b> | <b>-a</b>] -- Much like the MPW Shell Set command.<br>
The variable is set to the specified text. The <b>-i</b> and <b>-a</b> options allow text to be<br>
added to any existing setting of the variable at the start or the end,<br>
respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Output commands</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Print</b> [<i>text</i>] [<b>-appendto</b> | <b>-to</b><i>file</i>] -- Writes output to a specified file.<br>
If <i>text</i> is empty, the current line is printed without modification.<br>
The<b>-appendto</b> and <b>-to</b> options write at the end of the file or overwrite the<br>
file, respectively. If no file is specified, standard output is used. If the<br>
filename is empty, nothing gets printed.</li>
<li><b>Option AutoDelete</b> -- Deletes all input lines, leaving only output from<br>
Next and Print commands. You can get the same effect by specifying the<br>
<b>-d</b>option on the StreamEdit command line or by including this in the script:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      /~/    Delete</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The text arguments to these commands are usually literal text, denoted by single or<br>
double quotes. There are a few other forms as well:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An unquoted variable name can be used, in which case the variable is<br>
expanded; no brackets need be (or even may be) supplied.</li>
<li>A period means the current input line up to but not including the newline<br>
character at the end.</li>
<li>As discussed in Issue 26, you can use &#198; (Option-R) followed by a digit to<br>
mean the expression with that number matched in the pattern.</li>
<li>You can read text from a file with <b>-from</b><i>filename</i>, which reads the next<br>
line of text from the specified file. The filename is usually literal text, but it<br>
could also be a variable, the current input line (denoted by a period), or a&nbsp;&nbsp;&#198;<br>
expression.</li>
</ul>


<h2>A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>
Let's say you're the director of corporate communications at a major computer maker<br>
and, without any warning except for inventory backlogs larger than the gross national<br>
products of many developing countries, you experience a sudden transition in chief<br>
executive officers, corporate policy, and product line. Your quarterly report (10-Q)<br>
is due in the SEC's EDGAR database tomorrow. Fortunately the SEC requires the<br>
cutting-edge ASCII format for its filings, and you realize that you can automate 90% of<br>
the tedious changes with a single StreamEdit script.
</p>
<pre># Change nickname of CEO
/Diesel/
Replace // 'Flyboy'

# Change corporate policy
/1,$/
Replace /capture market share/ 'survive'

# Remove lines referring to obsolete products
/PowerTalk/ || /eWorld/
Delete

# Change developer relations strategy
/third-party developers/
Replace /evangelize/ 'listen to'

# Mark lines referring to old schedules with a
# distinctive string at the start of the line
# for manual editing later
/1996/
Insert 'WHOOPS: '

# Add new final line of report
[[infinity]]
Append 'May God have mercy on our souls.'</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>


<h2>CONTROL YOURSELF</h2>
<p>
StreamEdit is almost too powerful. People have used it for everything, including<br>
pretty-printing source code, converting files to HTML, and postprocessing object files<br>
for dynamic linking tools. If you use it for finding incriminating passages in<br>
coworkers' e-mail, karma may get you, but the limitations of the tool won't. Use your<br>
powers for good rather than evil, and a grateful world will thank you.
