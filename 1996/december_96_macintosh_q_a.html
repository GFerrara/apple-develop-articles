<h1>Macintosh Q &amp; A</h1>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>My application animates moving geometries in QuickDraw 3D. Recently I've been<br>

seeing a lot of screen flicker, and faces of geometries that should be behind other faces<br>
are showing through. What's going on?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;The flickering problem is probably happening because double buffering is turned<br>

off (call Q3DrawContext_SetDoubleBufferState to turn it on) or because double buffer<br>
bypass is set on the interactive renderer and the scene is taking longer than a screen<br>
refresh to render. See page 12-8 of <i>3D Graphics Programming With QuickDraw 3D</i><br>
for more information.
</p>
<p>
Your second problem is likely the result of having an excessively large difference<br>
between <b>hither</b> and <b>yon</b> (and, as a result, not having enough <i>z</i>resolution to resolve<br>
depth differences). Experiment with greater <b>hither</b> values and smaller yon values to<br>
see if the bleed-through goes away.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>We're using QuickDraw 3D and applying UV attributes to our geometries so that we<br>

can texture-map them. There are, however, two sorts of UVs: surface UVs and shading<br>
UVs. Which one should we use to get the textures to map correctly and what does the<br>
other one do?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;At the time of this writing (QuickDraw 3D 1.5), only the surface UVs are<br>

supported. The shading UVs will be used in a future version to support advanced<br>
shading renderers.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>What are view hints in the QuickDraw 3D metafile format (3DMF)?</i></p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;The concept of view hints was included early on in the development of QuickDraw<br>

3D. It became apparent that the settings for determining how a scene should be<br>
rendered aren't always transportable from one application to another (for example,<br>
settings such as the camera location, lighting, and camera type). The idea of a view<br>
hint is that it sets up a series of hints that tell the reading application how the author<br>
of a metafile intended the geometries within the metafile to be rendered. The fact that<br>
these are hints implies that the reading application can ignore them.
</p>
<p>
Rather than writing out the lighting information to the metafile as absolute objects, we<br>
recommend creating a view in the normal manner, adding lighting, camera, renderer,<br>
and other information as usual, and then extracting the view hints from the view with<br>
Q3ViewHints_New(theView). You pass in a view object to this function, and it returns<br>
a view hints object that includes the view configuration for the view you pass in. The<br>
Tumbler and Podium sample code that comes with the QuickDraw 3D release<br>
illustrates how to use view hints read from a metafile to configure a view. Look in the<br>
file Tumbler_document.c for details.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>What's the best way to do collision detection in QuickDraw 3D?</i></p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;QuickDraw 3D doesn't directly provide collision detection, but you can use the<br>

bounding boxes or bounding spheres of the geometries to determine whether the bounds<br>
intersect. You can easily calculate bounding boxes and spheres on either individual<br>
geometries or groups of geometries. If the bounds intersect, you can either assume the<br>
objects have collided or test further, depending on your application.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>In the TQ3CameraData record, is the position of the point of interest relative to the<br>

camera location used for anything other than the view direction of the camera?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;The point of interest is an absolute position -- it's not relative to anything. As the<br>

camera's location changes, the camera "turns" to keep the point of interest in view.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>TQ3HitData's distance field is described for window-point picking as "the distance<br>

from window point's location on the camera frustum (in world space) to the point of<br>
intersection with the picked object." Does this refer to the center of the intersection of<br>
the pixel's frustum with the hither plane, or maybe the yon plane? Or is it the camera<br>
location?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;TQ3HitData's distance field is the world space distance from the origin of the<br>

picking ray to the intersection point. Effectively, this is the distance from the<br>
camera's location to the geometry intersection point in world coordinates.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>When I print with background printing enabled, and PrintMonitor fires up and<br>

tries to post an error, my application hangs, and no dialog ever appears. What can I<br>
do?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Make sure the bits in your SIZE resource are set correctly. This behavior appears<br>

when you've got your "MultiFinder aware" bit set but don't have your "accepts<br>
Suspend/Resume events" bit set.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I can't figure out how to get the default settings for the features in a given<br>

QuickDraw GX font. Any ideas?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;A routine to do this, GXGetFontDefaultFeatures, was added after the release of<br>

QuickDraw GX 1.0. This routine will retrieve those layout features defined as default<br>
by a given font. It's fully documented in Technote 1028, "Inside Macintosh: GX Series<br>
Addenda."
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I want to turn my font (generated with a third-party font design program) into a<br>

true QuickDraw GX font with a customized features menu. How do I do this? What<br>
programs are available for GX font design? Will I be able to add a features menu to my<br>
font after generating it with a non-GX font design program?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;For custom design of QuickDraw GX features in a font, you should use TrueEdit,<br>

which is available (along with other font tools) in the QuickDraw GX folder on the Mac<br>
OS SDK edition of the Developer CD Series, or via ftp in this directory:<br>
/cgi-bin/ftpchooser.pl?partialURL=Development_Kits/QuickDraw_GX/Goodies/<br>
Font_Tools/.
</p>
<p>
The general process of designing a QuickDraw GX font starts with building all the<br>
glyphs you're interested in and hinting them, just as you would for a non-GX font. Once<br>
you have the glyph repertoire, use TrueEdit to add all the GX tables. You should be able<br>
to add the tables for the various menu features with TrueEdit just fine after you've<br>
built the font with another font design program.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I read somewhere that you don't have to call CloseOpenTransport if you're writing<br>

an application. Is this true?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Yes and no. The original Open Transport programming documentation stated that<br>

calling CloseOpenTransport was optional for applications. There is, however, a bug in<br>
Open Transport 1.1 and earlier whereby native PowerPC applications aren't properly<br>
cleaned up when they terminate unless CloseOpenTransport is called.
</p>
<p>
Here are some rules of thumb:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nonapplication code must always call CloseOpenTransport when it<br>
terminates.</li>
<li>It's best if 680x0 applications call CloseOpenTransport, but they'll be<br>
cleaned up automatically even if they don't.</li>
<li>Make sure that PowerPC applications running under Open Transport 1.1<br>
or earlier call CloseOpenTransport when terminating.</li>
</ul>
<p>
One way of ensuring that you comply with the third item is to use a CFM terminate<br>
procedure in your main application fragment, like this:
</p>
<pre>static Boolean gOTInited = false;
void CFMTerminate(void)
{
   if (gOTInited) {
      gOTInited = false;
      (void) CloseOpenTransport();
   }
}

void main(void)
{
   OSStatus err;
   err = InitOpenTransport();
   gOTInited = (err == noErr);

   ...   // the rest of your application

   if (gOTInited) {
      (void) CloseOpenTransport();
      gOTInited = false;
   }
}</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In general, when the Mac OS provides an automatic cleanup mechanism, it's normally<br>
intended as a "safety net." It's always a good idea to do your own cleanup, at least for<br>
normal application termination.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'm using OTScheduleSystemTask to schedule a task to run at non-interrupt time.<br>

Will this be cleaned up automatically when I call CloseOpenTransport?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;No. You must explicitly clean up any pending system tasks by calling the routine<br>

OTDestroySystemTask. See Technote 1059, "On Improving Open Transport Network<br>
Server Performance," for a good discussion of this.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>How do I map Open Transport error numbers to their names?</i></p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;There are two ways to do this. The first is the OTErr MacsBug dcmd that ships with<br>

the debugging version of Open Transport. This dcmd allows you to quickly map an error<br>
number to a (hopefully) meaningful error name. Once you install it in your Debugger<br>
Prefs file, you can type, for example, "oterr -3271" in MacsBug and get the name for<br>
that error.
</p>
<p>
The second solution is to read the latest OpenTransport.h header (for Open Transport<br>
version 1.1.1 or later), where the error numbers are now spelled out in an<br>
easy-to-read format.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'm writing an Open Transport server product and will be implementing hand-off<br>

endpoints. What is the maximum <b>qlen</b> value that limits the number of hand-off<br>
endpoints that can be implemented?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;There's a maximum <b>qlen</b> value for each protocol, but maximum values that are<br>

true today for Open Transport may change in the future, so we recommend that you set<br>
the <b>qlen</b> value to a <i>desired</i> value. If the desired value is greater than the number of<br>
hand-off endpoints that the underlying protocol can support, the protocol can specify<br>
its own maximum <b>qlen</b> value for the server endpoint. After making the OTBind call,<br>
take a look at the <b>qlen</b> field of the TBind structure to see whether the protocol imposed<br>
a limit on the <b>qlen</b> value.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'm developing a plug-in (let's call it MyPlugIn) for an application (let's say<br>

CoolApp). I'd like to create a special icon for the documents my plug-in creates, but<br>
they're really CoolApp documents. However, if I add a BNDL resource to MyPlugIn, all<br>
other CoolApp plug-ins become MyPlugIn documents. What can I do?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Just register a new, unique creator code and use that for the BNDL, but not for the<br>

plug-in. Contrary to popular belief, the owner code for a BNDL doesn't have to match<br>
the creator code of the file it's in.
</p>
<p>
Another possibility is to create custom icons for documents you create, but this has a<br>
couple of drawbacks: it takes the Finder longer to display them, and you'd be storing<br>
redundant data if the icons are all the same.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you should also add 'STR ' resources with IDs -16396 and -16397 so that the<br>
Finder can display a meaningful message if an application can't be found to open the<br>
file. (See <i>Inside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox Essentials</i>, pages 7-27 to 7-30.)
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'm using MPW and MacApp from E.T.O. 20. Where are the 411 help files?</i></p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Starting with E.T.O. 20, the 411 files have been converted to QuickView(TM)<br>

format and can be accessed through the Info menu of the MPW Shell.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Why is Apple now making the latest versions of MacApp available under a "release"<br>

approach, instead of the previous "product" approach?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;In response to the many messages we received from developers requesting early<br>

access to new framework features and timely support for new technologies, Apple has<br>
implemented a release approach with MacApp that allows us to get new improvements<br>
and features in our frameworks into your hands more quickly than was possible with<br>
the product approach.
</p>
<p>
Previously, our product approach required that we implement all planned features<br>
before the MacApp product was considered final. We found that this was keeping us<br>
from getting new features to you simply because other more time-consuming work<br>
was delaying the completion of the product. Under the new approach, each framework<br>
release will be made up of features at various levels of certification. Most features<br>
will be of final quality, while others may be of beta or alpha quality. You can choose<br>
the features to build your MacApp-based application with, and by doing so you'll<br>
choose the quality level of the resulting application. Our build tools will indicate the<br>
quality level you've chosen from the build flags you've passed to them. The release<br>
notes that accompany each MacApp release will list the features included in the<br>
framework and their quality status.
</p>
<p>
Over the course of multiple releases, every feature will proceed through alpha, beta,<br>
and final quality phases. Some features will move rapidly from development into final<br>
quality, perhaps in as little time as one release, while other features may require<br>
several releases. This approach ensures that the software features Apple provides to<br>
you are of the highest possible quality, while still allowing you to experiment with<br>
new, unproved features. Apple will create a new release version of MacApp<br>
approximately once every six to nine months, and the MacApp product will ship once<br>
each E.T.O. delivery cycle. Releases of MacApp that occur between E.T.O. shipment dates<br>
will be posted to the Web at http://www.devtools.apple.com/macapp/.
</p>
<p>
Note that for each MacApp release, you should <i>always</i> refer to the release notes for the<br>
quality status. For some releases, we recommend that you don't build applications that<br>
you intend to rely on as final-quality applications. Releases that have final-quality<br>
status are suitable for building final-quality MacApp-based applications.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>When linking my application in MPW, I get this error message:<br>
<pre>### Link: Error: Can't open object file for input. (Error 32)
ETO#19:Libraries:CLibraries:CSANELib.o is not an object file.</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>

Why am I getting this message?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;If you look at the CSANELib.o itself, you'll see that it's really just a text file<br>

containing this:
</p>
<pre>The library "CSANELib.o" is obsolete beginning with the PreRelease
environment of ETO 18 and the Latest environment on MPW Pro 19.

Use the "{Libraries}MathLib.o" library instead.

"CSANELib.o" is incompatible with the SC/SCpp compilers,
and is incompatible with the new FPCE floating point model.
See the header file &lt;fp.h&gt; for more details.

Please read the release notes.

You may safely delete this file when you are sure that all of your
Make files have been updated.</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In fact, as of E.T.O. 20, all of the following libraries are obsolete: Runtime.o,<br>
Complex.o, Complex881.o, CPlusLib881.o, CPlusOldStreams881.o, CPlusOStreams.o,<br>
CSANELib.o, CSANELib881.o, Math.o, Math881.o, AppleScriptLib.xcoff, CPlusLib.o,<br>
InterfaceLib.xcoff, MathLib.xcoff, ObjectSupportLib.xcoff, QuickTimeLib.xcoff,<br>
SpeechLib.xcoff, and StdCLib.xcoff. These "libraries" are now text documents, similar<br>
to the above. Each of them contains information about the libraries you should use<br>
instead.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I understand how to use PrGeneral with the getRslDataOp opcode to get the<br>

resolutions that a printer supports, but when I ask the LaserWriter driver about<br>
resolutions, it always tells me I'm talking to a 300 dpi printer, even when I know the<br>
printer is, say, 600 dpi. I want to print at the maximum resolution available. How can<br>
I do that?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Currently, the LaserWriter driver always returns a range of 25 to 1500 dpi for<br>

valid resolutions, and a fixed resolution of 300 dpi. The range of 25 to 1500 means<br>
that your application can ask for any resolution in that range, and the driver will<br>
allow it, as explained in Technote PR 07, "PrGeneral." However, given that<br>
LaserWriters and other PostScript printers can support only a limited number of<br>
resolutions, you may not get optimal results if you pick the wrong resolution for a<br>
printer, even if the driver lets you. You'll also end up sending more data than is needed<br>
if you're generating bitmaps at a higher resolution than the printer can print, which<br>
can slow printing down significantly. Furthermore, some extremely high-resolution<br>
devices may be able to print at a resolution higher than 1500 dpi, but the range<br>
returned by PrGeneral was chosen quite a while ago and hasn't been changed for<br>
application compatibility reasons.
</p>
<p>
Currently, the only way to get the actual resolution(s) supported by a PostScript<br>
printer (short of querying the printer directly) is to ask the LaserWriter driver for<br>
the PPD file and parse it yourself, looking for the valid resolutions. To get the PPD<br>
file, call PrGeneral with the PSPrimaryPPDOp opcode, which is 15. This is<br>
documented in the Macintosh Technical Q&amp;A QD 01, "PPDs." When Apple makes the<br>
functions in LaserWriter 8.4's PPD Library public, you'll also be able to use those<br>
functions to get the information from the PPD, but the API to that library hasn't yet<br>
been made available as of this writing.
</p>
<p>
To parse the PPD file, you'll need to consult the PPD specification maintained by<br>
Adobe. That document can be found at Adobe's ftp site, at the<br>
locationftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/devtechnotes/psfiles/.
</p>
<p>
Rather than go to all that work, however, a better approach might be to change your<br>
code so that you don't need to know the printer's resolution in order to generate<br>
high-quality output. Some of the various ways to solve this problem are listed below;<br>
the approach you take will depend on your application requirements. Also, see the<br>
Print Hints column in this issue of <i>develop</i>, which discusses this very problem<br>
(among others).
</p>
<ul>
<li>If your application is such that you require a PostScript printer, you<br>
could generate your own PostScript code to achieve high-quality results.</li>
<li>You could generate your own PostScript code but also use a QuickDraw<br>
representation so that images will print correctly to StyleWriters and other<br>
QuickDraw printers. This solution is recommended if you're writing a<br>
program that draws curves, such as a graphing program. For best results,<br>
break down the curves you need to draw into small portions that can be<br>
accurately represented by the QuickDraw primitives you have at your<br>
command.</li>
<li>You could use QuickDraw only, but draw in such a way that you'll get<br>
high-resolution results. To do this, use objects such as lines, ovals, and arcs<br>
rather than bitmaps. The endpoints of the objects will be limited by the<br>
resolution at which you draw, but the objects will be drawn at device<br>
resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I noticed that several QuickTime Music Architecture routines (TuneResume,<br>

TuneFlush, TuneGetState) are missing in the latest headers. What gives?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;The routines TuneResume, TuneFlush, and TuneGetState were poorly defined, and in<br>

fact were unimplemented in QuickTime 2.0 and 2.1. They've been removed from the<br>
headers.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>_StuffXNoteEvent, a QuickTime Music Architecture macro, has vanished from the<br>

latest headers. Why?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Whoops. A mistake was made, and _StuffXNoteEvent didn't make it into the final<br>

release header. You can copy the macro from the older header file if you need it, but<br>
for consistency you should rename it qtma__StuffXNoteEvent. Here it is as well:
</p>
<pre>#define qtma_StuffXNoteEvent(w1, w2, instrument, pitch, volume, \
        duration) \
   w1 = (kXNoteEventType << kXEventTypeFieldPos) \
   |   ((long)(instrument) << kXEventInstrumentFieldPos) \
   |   ((long)(pitch) << kXNoteEventPitchFieldPos), \
   w2 =   (kXEventLengthBits << kEventLengthFieldPos) \
   |   ((long)(duration) << kXNoteEventDurationFieldPos) \
   |   ((long)(volume) << kXNoteEventVolumeFieldPos)</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Why did the old _EventLength(x) macro get split into two macros,<br>

qtma_EventLengthForward(xP, ulen) and qtma_EventLengthBackward(xP, ulen)?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;_EventLength(x) had to be changed because of some new event types. We needed<br>

separate macros to determine the length from the first long word of a music event and<br>
from the last one. Typically, you'll be using qtma_EventLengthForward.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i><i>Inside Macintosh: QuickTime Components</i> states that the limit on data transfer rates<br>

for the base media handler (and therefore all media handlers derived from it) is 32<br>
kilobits per second. Is that true?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Starting with QuickTime 2.0, when the data handler API became publicly available,<br>

that statement is no longer accurate. In fact, QuickTime imposes no limitation on<br>
performance at all; the hardware you're using is the only limiting factor.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I heard at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference last May that the QuickTime<br>

for Windows installer can be customized through a ".INI" file. Where can I get more<br>
information about this?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Following is the format for the optional configuration file that can be used with the<br>

installer for QuickTime for Windows version 2.1.2. If used, the file must be named<br>
QTINSTAL.INI, and it must be located in the same directory as the installer,<br>
QTINSTAL.EXE. (The 32-bit installer is called QT32INST.EXE, and the corresponding<br>
".INI" file must be called QT32INST.INI.)
</p>
<p>
For all of the options listed except DialogStyle, a value of 1 enables the option and a<br>
value of 0 disables it. The default for all values is 1, unless otherwise noted. Although<br>
all combinations of options are designed to work (that is, the program will run<br>
correctly), not all combinations will yield a viable result. For example, creating a<br>
program group without unpacking the files would probably not be a good idea.
</p>
<pre>; All QTW installer options must be in the following section:
[Options]
; The QuickTime background can be suppressed when QTINSTAL is to be
; called from another program:
;   1 - shows a background window with QuickTime banner.
;   0 - shows no background window.
StandAlone=1
; A Dialog style may be specified by one of the following values:
;   1 - Thin frame
;   2 - System menu
;   3 - Thin frame and system menu (default)
DialogStyle=3
; If the following option is set, the client area of all dialogs will
; have a 3-D look.
Ctl3D=1
; If the following option is set, the installer will display the QTW
; end-user license agreement, with Agree/Disagree buttons.
DisplayLicenseAgreement=1
; If the following option is set, an opening dialog will prompt the
; user whether to begin the installation or to exit.
PromptToBegin=1
; If the following option is set, existing-version checking will be
; enabled and the installer will evaluate the PromptToDeleteVersions
; option.  If CheckExistingVersions is set to zero, the installer
; will not check for existing versions.
CheckExistingVersions=1
; If CheckExistingVersions and the following option are set, the
; installer will prompt the user before doing a search operation for
; all out-of-date QTW installations on the machine.  For each
; installation found, a dialog will ask the user whether to mark it
; for deletion.  If this option is set to zero, the search will be
; unconditional and all installations found will be marked for
; deletion.
PromptToDeleteVersions=1
; If the following option is set, a "do you want to continue" dialog
; will appear before any files are deleted or the hard disk is
; modified in any way.
PromptToComplete=1
; If the following option is set, all files will be unpacked from the
; executable and written to disk.  Care and consideration should be
; used before setting this option to zero, since a zero value means
; no files will be installed.
UnpackFiles=1
; If the following option is set, the Windows INI files will be
; updated.
UpdateIniFiles=1
; If the following option is set, Program Manager groups will be
; created.
CreateGroups=1
; If CreateGroups is set and the following option is used, the
; specified name will be used as the group name (that is, the name;
; as it displays in the window titlebar, not the group filename)
; that the installer will use when installing the QuickTime icons.
; For example, the option shown would use the group name "My Group."
; If the group does not exist it will be created.  This option can
; be used to add the QuickTime applications to an existing group
; file.  The string used to specify a group name should be tested
; in actual use, since there is a practical upper limit to the number
; of characters Windows will use in a window title.
GroupName=My Group
; If the following option is set, a success dialog will indicate
; whether the installation has completed successfully.
SuccessDialog=1
; If SuccessDialog and the following option are both set, the
; installer will launch Movie Player with a sample movie to verify
; that QTW has been installed successfully.
PlaySampleMovie=1
The Installer also always creates a file in the Windows directory
called RESULT.QTW that looks like this:
[QTW Install 16]
Complete=1
[QTW Install 32]
Complete=1</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If Complete equals 0, the installation didn't finish for some reason (any reason, such<br>
as the user canceling, or running out of disk space, or whatever). This enables the<br>
title installer to tell whether the QuickTime for Windows installation was successful<br>
and to respond appropriately.
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>I'm playing four QuickTime movies simultaneously from a Director project. Each<br>

movie has a single music track with no other video or sound tracks, and two of the<br>
movies use more than one instrument. The Director project lets the user control the<br>
volume level of each movie independently. The application works great on the<br>
Macintosh with QuickTime 2.1, but under Windows with QuickTime 2.11 only one<br>
music track plays at a time. Is it possible to hear all four music tracks at once under<br>
QuickTime for Windows 2.11?</i>
</p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;You can do live mixing of your four QuickTime movies only if your Windows<br>

system has four MIDI output devices. Most systems have only one. All Windows<br>
applications suffer from this limitation unless they're clever enough to mix the tracks<br>
on the fly, but none seem to do this.

For now, you must pre-mix the four music tracks from the four movies into one<br>
music track in one movie. You won't be able to do live mixing unless you write your<br>
own MIDI sequencer.

<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;<i>Why do my eyes water when I chop onions?</i></p>
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp;Onions contain sulfur compounds, and when you cut into them they release sulfur<br>

dioxide. When the sulfur dioxide gas dissolves in your tears (which are mostly water),<br>
sulfurous acid is produced: SO2 + H2O --&gt; H2SO3. The acid burns your eyes, which<br>
respond by generating more tears in an attempt to flush away the acid.&nbsp;&nbsp;See<br>
http://www.superscience.com/onions.html as well.
