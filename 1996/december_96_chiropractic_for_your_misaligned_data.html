<p>
Sometimes Macintosh application performance is limited by architectural factors that<br>
can't be remedied, like the raw speed of the I/O or memory subsystem. But the<br>
programmer <i>does</i> have control over some factors that affect the speed of the memory<br>
subsystem and thus application performance -- such as how data is aligned and<br>
accessed within memory. By default, most compilers will do the appropriate alignment<br>
for PowerPC code. However, alignment options offered for backward compatibility<br>
with the 680x0 architecture can cause significant overhead.
</p>
<p>
Misalignment is a difficult performance problem to detect. Traditional debugging and<br>
performance tools typically don't help you find misaligned accesses. On top of this,<br>
misalignment problems manifest themselves differently on different CPU<br>
architectures. 
</p>
<p>
In this article, we'll define misalignment, describe how it's caused, discuss the<br>
overhead penalties for accessing misaligned data on various microprocessors, and<br>
introduce some tools designed to aid in the detection of misaligned accesses in code.<br>
These tools accompany the article on this issue's CD and <i>develop</i>'s Web site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed<br>
with these tools and what you learn in this article, you can perform chiropractic<br>
adjustments on your programs to solve their data alignment problems.
</p>


<h2>WHAT IS MISALIGNMENT AND WHY SHOULD I CARE?</h2>
<p>
A piece of data is properly aligned when it resides at a memory address that a<br>
processor can access efficiently. If it doesn't reside at such an address, it's said to be<br>
misaligned. In the PowerPC architecture, 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point numbers<br>
are misaligned when they reside at addresses not divisible by 4. Misalignment<br>
exceptions are taken based on the specific microprocessor.
</p>
<p>
Whether a data item is aligned depends not only on its address and the processor that's<br>
performing the access, but also on the size of the item. In general, data of size <i>s</i> is<br>
aligned if the least significant <i>n</i> bits of its address are 0, where <i>n</i> = log<i>2</i>(<i>s</i>). Hence,<br>
1-byte items are always aligned, while 2-byte items are aligned on even addresses and<br>
4-byte items are aligned if the address is evenly divisible by 4. This alignment policy<br>
is often called <i>natural alignment</i> and is the recommended data alignment for code to run<br>
well on all current and future PowerPC processors.
</p>
<p>
Accessing misaligned data can be quite costly, depending on the microprocessor your<br>
program is running on. We'll demonstrate just how costly in a minute, but in general,<br>
misaligned memory accesses take from 2 to 80 times longer than aligned accesses on<br>
603, 604, and future PowerPC microprocessors. A misaligned access can require<br>
more time to perform for two reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It may require two requests to the memory system instead of just one.</li>
<li>It may cause the processor to take an unaligned access exception, a costly<br>
penalty.</li>
</ul>


<h2>WHAT CAUSES MISALIGNMENT?</h2>
<p>
Misaligned accesses can involve variables located on the stack or on the heap. The type<br>
of compiler and the compiler settings that you use will determine whether misaligned<br>
accesses occur. Improper structure placement and incorrect pointer arithmetic can<br>
also cause misaligned accesses. These problems can be found with the tools and<br>
techniques described below, but this article generally focuses on alignment problems<br>
that aren't caused by programmatic errors.
</p>
<p>
Most compilers for the Macintosh allow you to choose among various alignment<br>
options. Some compilers default to 2-byte alignment so that data alignment in<br>
PowerPC code mimics alignment on the 680x0 processor. While using this option<br>
means that structures written to disk in binary format can be accessed easily by both<br>
architectures, it also permits alignment problems in the PowerPC architecture. Both<br>
improper structure padding and misaligned stack parameters can result in misaligned<br>
accesses.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPROPER STRUCTURE PADDING</b>
</p>
<p>
When a <b>float</b> field occurs in a structure, improper padding by the compiler will cause<br>
the <b>float</b> field to be misaligned. The example in Listing 1 uses MPW's alignment<br>
pragmas to illustrate this.
</p>
<p>
______________________________
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1. </b>An example of a poorly aligned structure
</p>
<pre>#pragma options align=mac68k
typedef struct sPoorlyAlignedStruct {
   char      fCharField;
   float     fFloatField;
   char      fSecondCharField;
} sPoorlyAlignedStruct;

sPoorlyAlignedStruct      gPoorlyAlignedStruct;
#pragma options align=reset</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
______________________________
</p>
<p>
In this example, a compiler that did no padding would align fFloatField on an offset of<br>
one byte from the structure's base address. Since compilers (and memory allocators)<br>
usually align the base of a structure on a boundary of at least four bytes (and<br>
multiples of four bytes), every access to fFloatField will cause a misalignment error.<br>
Also, fFloatField will be misaligned in statically or dynamically allocated arrays, since<br>
the lengths of structures are padded so that each structure that's an array element<br>
starts on a 4-byte aligned address.
</p>
<p>
A compiler with a 2-byte padding setting would align fFloatField on an even address,<br>
but this would still cause misalignment when that address isn't divisible by 4.<br>
Compilers using the mac68k pragma (as shown in Listing 1) cause 2-byte alignment,<br>
putting fFloatField on an even but often misaligned address for PowerPC processors.
</p>
<p>
A compiler with a 4-byte padding setting would always align the field properly.
</p>
<p>
<b>MISALIGNED STACK PARAMETERS</b>
</p>
<p>
Besides affecting the alignment of data in a structure, compiler settings can affect the<br>
way data structures are placed on the stack. Consider this function declaration:
</p>
<pre>void FunctionFoo (sPoorlyAlignedStruct firstParam, float floatParam)</pre><p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In this example, the parameters are placed on the stack (even though PowerPC<br>
compilers use registers if possible). A compiler using a 680x0 2-byte padding option<br>
may align firstParam.fFloatField on an even address, but if the address isn't divisible<br>
by 4 this will cause a misalignment every time that parameter field is accessed within<br>
FunctionFoo. It won't, however, change the alignment of other parameters on the stack.
</p>

<p>
On the PowerPC processor, nonstructure parameters are usually placed in registers.<br>
There are no alignment problems when accessing registers.
</p>


<h2>THE COST OF MISALIGNMENTS</h2>
<p>
To demonstrate the cost of misalignments, we've written the code in Listing 2, which<br>
generates both aligned and misaligned accesses in the course of a million iterations. It<br>
accesses a byte array in different ways -- data writes of integers, floats, and doubles<br>
-- and at different offsets. In a portion of the code not shown, accesses are confined to<br>
within a single page of memory, and interrupts are turned off. Running this code<br>
enabled us to calculate the difference in performance between aligned and misaligned<br>
accesses. This code (with slight modifications for the various compilers) was compiled<br>
with the Symantec, MrC, and Metrowerks compilers. All compilers behaved similarly.

Table 1 shows the results. Overhead is calculated as the percentage difference between<br>
the time required for aligned and misaligned accesses. Our experiments showed that<br>
misaligned accesses at different offsets seemed to pay the same penalty (excluding<br>
cases where the two accesses required to retrieve the data straddle a memory page<br>
boundary, which is every 4K of memory).

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Tests were run at 80 MHz on the PowerPC 601 and 132 MHz on the PowerPC<br>
604.
</p>
<p>
Misaligned integer accesses result in a relatively small penalty for PowerPC 601,<br>
603, and 604 CPUs. However, there's no guarantee that future microprocessors will<br>
provide hardware support for integer misalignment. Floating-point misalignments are<br>
severely penalized by the 604 implementation. In fact, while a misaligned access takes<br>
1.5 times as long as an aligned access on the 601, it takes more than 80 times as long<br>
as an aligned access on the 604. The 601 pays a penalty only when an access crosses a<br>
page boundary (this will be verified later). Misaligned accesses to doubles on a 601<br>
result in nearly double the overhead of misaligned accesses to floats. On the 604,<br>
however, doubles and floats suffer nearly the same overhead penalty. Misaligned<br>
accesses for doubles occur on any address not divisible by 8 on the 601, and any<br>
address not divisible by 4 on the 604. It's important to note that all memory accesses<br>
(aligned and misaligned) result in some timing penalty.
</p>
<p>
When we ran these experiments as emulated code (compiled for 680x0), float and<br>
double accesses showed no significant overhead (less than 8%). The 68040LC<br>
emulator doesn't do PowerPC floating-point loads/stores when processing<br>
floating-point data; it avoids alignment exceptions by doing integer emulation of a<br>
floating-point unit and loading and storing data 16 bits at a time.
</p>
<p>
Our code paints a worst-case scenario; worst case or not, the results indicate that<br>
there's plenty of motivation to avoid misaligned accesses in native PowerPC code.<br>
Perhaps the biggest problem facing the programmer, however, is the detection of these<br>
problems in application code. We'll look now at two tools that are useful for detecting<br>
and pinpointing alignment problems.
</p>


<h2>TOOLS FOR DETECTING MISALIGNMENTS</h2>
<p>
Apple's Performance Evaluation Group has developed two tools for detecting<br>
misalignments that cause exceptions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>PPCInfoSampler, a tool to detect high levels of misalignment exceptions<br>
over general application workloads</li>
<li>the Misalignment Instrument Library (MIL), a set of functions useful for<br>
profiling misalignments in specific regions of code</li>
</ul>
<p>
PPCInfoSampler is useful for determining whether your code has misalignment<br>
problems. If misaligned accesses are detected, the MIL can be used to pinpoint which<br>
parts of your code are causing the misalignments. We'll describe each tool in greater<br>
detail before discussing how to correct misalignments that you identify.
</p>
<p>
<b>PPCINFOSAMPLER</b>
</p>
<p>
PPCInfoSampler is a control panel that when activated records information about the<br>
PowerPC exception services and emulator at 100-millisecond intervals. The<br>
information recorded includes counts of mode switches, interrupts, misalignment<br>
exceptions, and page faults. See Table 2 for a list of PPCInfoSampler output categories.<br>
The output saved from PPCInfoSampler is in tab-delimited format and is best viewed<br>
from a spreadsheet program.
</p>

<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> With the exception of microseconds time, each measurement is per sample and<br>
isn't cumulative with the next interval.
</p>
<p>
To use PPCInfoSampler, you must first drop it into your Control Panels folder and<br>
reboot. The tool installs code in the system heap that waits for an action to occur. There<br>
are two ways to activate the sampling mechanism:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use the keyboard shortcut Command-Option-Z to start the<br>
sampler instantly at any time. When you start the sampler, an 8-pixel line<br>
will flash in the upper left corner of your main screen. It will continue to<br>
flash for each sample that's recorded. To stop the sampler, use the keyboard<br>
shortcut again.</li>
<li>You can use the control panel interface, as shown in Figure 1, to start,<br>
stop, and save a sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1. </b> PPCInfoSampler control panel interface
</p>
<p>
For our purposes, let's focus on the number of misalignment exceptions. To determine<br>
in general whether you have misalignment problems in your application, think of the<br>
operations or "workloads" (such as saving to disk) that force your application to<br>
access many data structures. Run PPCInfoSampler during these workloads to<br>
determine whether any misalignments are occurring. Any misalignment count greater<br>
than 0 should be investigated and, if possible, corrected.
</p>
<p>
Table 3 shows an example of a misalignment count generated by PPCInfoSampler. The<br>
program that was being executed during this count displayed bursty misalignment<br>
characteristics. That is, during some 100-millisecond intervals no misalignments<br>
were happening; during other intervals, large numbers were happening.

<p>
<b>THE MISALIGNMENT INSTRUMENT LIBRARY</b>
</p>
<p>
Where PPCInfoSampler allows you to detect misalignment activity in broad<br>
100-millisecond intervals, the Misalignment Instrument Library (MIL) allows you<br>
to then make educated guesses about where to further instrument your code to pinpoint<br>
where the misalignment is happening. The MIL consists of two routines:
</p>
<pre>void initMisalignRegs(void);        // Initializes our misalignment
                                     // counter (do this only once)
unsigned long getMisalignments(void); // Returns the total number of
                                     // misalignment exceptions since
                                     // the initMisalignRegs call</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
With these calls to the MIL, you can profile strategic portions of your source for the<br>
application's workloads. Iteratively narrow the focus of your profile by moving the<br>
instrumentation in the code until you can determine where the misaligned accesses are<br>
and the structures that they're associated with.
</p>
<p>
Listing 3 is a sample of application code instrumented with the MIL calls. In this<br>
sample, we use the MIL to display the different floating-point exception-handling<br>
properties of the 601 and 604 CPUs.

______________________________
</p>
<p>
The results of running this code are shown in Table 4. There's a large discrepancy<br>
between the number of misalignments generated and the number reported by the MIL<br>
on the 601. The 601 architecture internally fixes float and double misalignments in<br>
hardware. However, the 601 can't fix misalignments across page boundaries, so it<br>
takes a misalignment exception. Thus, only those page boundary cases are reported.<br>
The 603/604 architecture doesn't handle misalignments in hardware, and it takes an<br>
exception in all cases.

<h2>NOW FOR THE CHIROPRACTIC ADJUSTMENTS</h2>
<p>
You've determined with the help of PPCInfoSampler that you have misalignment<br>
problems in your application. You've used the MIL to determine where the misaligned<br>
accesses are and the structures that they're associated with. Now it's time to think<br>
about these structures.
</p>
<p>
Is there a reason why they can't be naturally aligned (as we described early in the<br>
article)? If there are structures in the parameter block passed to a Toolbox call,<br>
fields within these structures may not naturally align, but this is something the<br>
programmer can't do much about until the system provides an alternate API. Perhaps<br>
there are binary data files created and accessed from 680x0 legacy code. Is it really<br>
necessary to still be supporting data files formatted to 2-byte alignment? Can you<br>
provide a version mechanism for your data files, such that newer versions write and<br>
read to natural PowerPC alignment? Ask these questions, and naturally align<br>
structures as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
You can ensure proper structure alignment by ordering the fields in your structures<br>
by hand, from largest to smallest, instead of relying on a compiler to pad the fields.<br>
This will require you to do more work but will remove reliance on any particular<br>
padding strategy.
</p>
<p>
Another possible scenario is the case where data files are shared across multiple<br>
platforms. Alignment strategies on Intel and other x86 processors aren't the same as<br>
on PowerPC processors. There are two possible approaches to this scenario, given an<br>
application on Windows and one on the Mac OS that share the same data files:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Try compiling structures on the Windows application with 4-byte<br>
alignment, according to PowerPC natural alignment. This is a "least common<br>
denominator" approach.</li>
<li>If rebuilding a Windows application isn't a viable option, load the data<br>
from disk and convert the data structures to an aligned structure that's used<br>
internally. The performance tradeoff depends on how often the misaligned<br>
structure is used.</li>
</ul>


<h2>IT'S THAT SIMPLE</h2>
<p>
Misaligned memory accesses can take a real toll on your application's performance,<br>
requiring from 2 to 80 times longer than aligned accesses on newer PowerPC CPUs. If<br>
you do what we've described in this article, you can detect and pinpoint misalignments<br>
and fix them so that your code will run efficiently now and on future processors<br>
(which won't include hardware to fix misaligned accesses for any misaligned data<br>
type) and won't be penalized by the lack of hardware support in future<br>
implementations of PowerPC architecture. Isn't it worth a few simple adjustments<br>
now to know that your code's future is secure?
