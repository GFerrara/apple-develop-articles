<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>

<h1>CAROLINE ROSE</h1>
<p>
I'd like to make some general comments on user interface that I've been collecting for a<br>
while. Please understand I don't claim to be an expert on the subject -- and, as always,<br>
the usual disclaimer applies that my opinions aren't necessarily those of&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple<br>
Computer the corporate entity. I'm just one person who has the luxury (as well as the<br>
burden) of filling an editorial page, and this is what's on my mind.
</p>
<p>
First I'd like to make a pitch for a more obvious and responsive channel for users to<br>
give feedback on the experience of working with your software: What bugs them about<br>
it? Do they have suggestions for improvement? It seems that such feedback gets lost if<br>
it's delivered through the usual customer support (bug-reporting) vehicle. Or maybe<br>
it gets delivered to the wrong person, like the engineer who designed and implemented<br>
that feature in the first place and can give 99 excellent reasons for why it was done<br>
that way. When I first returned to Apple from NeXT and had to use a lot of new<br>
applications, I encountered a number of interface glitches that were short of being<br>
bugs but made using the applications unnecessarily awkward. I suggested a&nbsp;&nbsp;few simple<br>
fixes through the customer support line, sensing some interest but the assignment of a<br>
low pri - ority. Alas, those annoying features are all still there five years and a couple<br>
of upgrades later.
</p>
<p>
This ties in with a peeve that I share with many of my computer -using friends who<br>
don't work in this industry and so have that valuable perspective of a pure end user:<br>
Please avoid making spurious interface "improvements" that change the basic way&nbsp;&nbsp;I<br>
work with your application. Be sure there's a real benefit to the user before you<br>
change command names, rearrange them in menus, or put new features in my face<br>
rather than making them options I can explore at will. You may think you're making<br>
the interface friendlier, but in fact you may be alienating your existing customer base.<br>
The changes that I most appreciate are those that smooth out the rough spots of&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br>
interface as it is, so that, for example, I won't have to resize every mail window&nbsp;&nbsp;to fit<br>
my screen, or select the text in the Find box every time I do a new search. I want these<br>
nuisances eliminated; instead, I find the upgrade to be just another big nuisance.
</p>
<p>
We interrupt this list of grievances to announce another list we just learned about: <br>
develop has been cho - sen by Internet Valley, Inc. as one of the top 100<br>
computer-related magazines and journals on the Web<br>
(http://www.internetvalley.com/top100mag.html). I'm happy enough about this to<br>
quit my griping about user interface for now -- though I do see a tie-in here: we've<br>
always encouraged and responded to com - ments from our readers, and we've tweaked<br>
our content and format accordingly&nbsp;&nbsp;rather than done a com - plete overhaul. Thanks<br>
for all the valuable feedback over the years ; please keep it coming so that we can keep<br>
improving.
</p>

<b>CAROLINE ROSE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;(AppleLink CROSE) has been a technical editor for so long that she<br>
says she can do it with her eyes closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's exactly what she did after being<br>
felled by a detached retina during her last vacation. Lying down for over two weeks<br>
with her lids shut and not much to do except listen to books on tape, she welcomed the<br>
occasional phone call on a develop-related editorial question. Getting back to work and<br>
realizing how much catching up she had to do was a real eye-opening experience. *
