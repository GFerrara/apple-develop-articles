<p>
In this column in Issue 26 of develop, I showed you a wide range of scriptable editing<br>
commands available from the MPW Shell. This time I'll discuss a single tool that<br>
provides a powerful self-contained text-editing scripting language, StreamEdit.
</p>
<p>
Why would you want to use StreamEdit instead of the other text-editing features of the<br>
MPW Shell?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance -- A StreamEdit script is faster than an MPW script<br>
containing various Replace and Find commands.</li>
<li>Self-containment -- Because StreamEdit is a self-contained tool, you can<br>
run it from within ToolServer, unlike the scriptable editing commands<br>
discussed in Issue 26, which are available only in the MPW Shell itself. This<br>
means you can use StreamEdit to create lightweight drag-and-drop grinder<br>
AppleScript scripts that send StreamEdit commands to ToolServer.</li>
<li>Consistency -- Keeping all your editing in a single scripting language<br>
confers the elusive mystical boon of code consistency, making your system<br>
easier to maintain and modify in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h2>GETTING TO KNOW YOU</h2>
<p>
StreamEdit is based very closely on the hoary UNIX tool named sed. If you already know<br>
sed, much of this will be familiar, but StreamEdit isn't directly compatible with sed<br>
scripts.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An MPW version of sed is available as part of the GNU free software project.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One place you can find it is http://sunsite.cnam.fr/packages/gnu/cygnus/mac/
</p>
<p>
StreamEdit implements a pattern-matching language. Every time a particular pattern<br>
is matched, a sequence of commands will be executed. As in most pattern-matching<br>
languages, StreamEdit's scripts are lists of pattern/command pairs, with the pattern<br>
coming before the command. The input file or files are read through the script<br>
interpreter, which searches for instances of the patterns and executes the<br>
corresponding commands. Anything that doesn't match a pattern is passed through<br>
unchanged.
</p>
<p>
StreamEdit scans one line at a time through the input, matching its current line to<br>
every pattern in its script. After processing each line, it writes out the modified line.<br>
The result is a concatenation of three internal buffers: the insert buffer, then the edit<br>
buffer, and finally the append buffer. The edit buffer gets filled with the current line,<br>
while the other buffers are empty at the start. The Insert and Append commands place<br>
text in the insert and append buffers, allowing you to add text to the beginning and end<br>
of the output line. The Change, Delete, and Replace commands modify the contents of the<br>
edit buffer.

<h2>SHARING ADDRESSES</h2>
<p>
As usual, MPW uses words in ways previously unknown in human speech. In<br>
StreamEdit, patterns are referred to as "addresses." There are two kinds of addresses:<br>
line numbers and regular expressions. Line numbers ought to be self-explanatory, but<br>
it may help to note that the numbers must be Arabic numerals rather than Roman, and<br>
must be in base 10 rather than the hexadecimal or sexagesimal number systems.<br>
There are three special line numbers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the bullet symbol (Option-8), meaning the point before the first line<br>
(enabling you to add a line before the first line, for example)</li>
<li>the infinity symbol ([[infinity]], Option-5), meaning the point after the<br>
last line</li>
<li>dollar sign ($), meaning the last line</li>
</ul>
<p>
The keyboard shortcuts, as always in this column, are for American QWERTY<br>
keyboards; if you've got some other type of keyboard, you're on your own.
</p>
<p>
Regular expressions are expressions that manage their diets sensibly. They can be<br>
used for searching, and were explained in detail in Issue 26. In StreamEdit addresses,<br>
though, regular expressions find the entire line containing the pattern, rather than<br>
just the pattern. Regular expressions are denoted by slashes. Only forward slashes are<br>
used (StreamEdit doesn't have a backward search mode, having been frightened at an<br>
early age by the legends of Eurydice and Lot's wife). Three new constructs have been<br>
added to regular expressions in StreamEdit:
</p>
<ul>
<li>&#231; (Option-C), which indicates a case-sensitive search</li>
<li>// (two slashes), which means the last regular expression that was<br>
matched</li>
<li>&lt;=variable&gt;= (a variable name embedded in inequality operators, here<br>
overloaded as a special kind of angle brackets, and typed as Option-comma and<br>
Option-period), which means the text of an expanded StreamEdit variable,<br>
treated as literal text to be matched rather than as a regular expression</li>
</ul>
<p>
StreamEdit has variables that can be set with the Set command (more on this later) or<br>
from the command line using the -set variable [=value] option.
</p>
<p>
You can form more complex addresses using a few operators. The Boolean and, or, and<br>
not operators are the same as in C (&amp;&amp;, ||, and !, respectively). Parentheses can be<br>
used for grouping within addresses. The comma operator matches the range of lines<br>
specified; for example, 3,5 matches lines 3 through 5. A range address matches each of<br>
the lines in the range, if any. It can be thought of as matching more than once: it fires<br>
off the accompanying command on the first line matched, the last one matched, and all<br>
lines in between. If the termination condition is never met, the address continues to<br>
match until the end of input. This could happen if you specify a range of lines ending at<br>
line 15, for instance, and there are only ten lines in the file, or if your range<br>
termination condition is a regular expression that doesn't appear anywhere in the<br>
input.

<h2>TAKING ACTION</h2>
<p>
Matching patterns is very nice, but what do you do once you match them? Statements<br>
in StreamEdit attach actions to patterns. An action consists of one or more commands,<br>
separated by semicolons or by the end of a line. There's no begin or end bracketing as<br>
in Pascal or C. Addresses and commands are syntactically distinct, so the script<br>
interpreter can figure out where the list of commands for a pattern ends and the next<br>
pattern begins.
</p>
<h2>Editing commands</h2>
<ul>
<li>Insert text [-n] -- Adds the specified text to the start of the line by<br>
putting it in the insert buffer. The -n option (in this command and in Append<br>
and Change) prevents adding a newline when the line is written out.</li>
<li>Append text [-n] -- Adds the specified text to the end of the line by<br>
putting it in the append buffer.</li>
<li>Change text [-n] -- Changes the line to the specified text by replacing the<br>
contents of the edit buffer.</li>
<li>Delete -- Clears the edit buffer.</li>
<li>Replace [-c count] /pattern/ text -- Replaces the pattern with the<br>
specified text. This is the second part of a two-step matching process: first the<br>
address matches a line, then Replace searches in the edit buffer and replaces<br>
the pattern. The count argument indicates the maximum number of times to<br>
perform the replacement in the line. It can be a positive integer or infinity<br>
([[infinity]]). The default count is 1.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Control commands</h2>
<ul>
<li>Exit [status] -- Stops StreamEdit with the given error status. The default<br>
is 0, which means execution completed with no errors. Any nonzero error<br>
status indicates a problem, and unless the built-in MPW variable Exit is set<br>
to something other than 0, this will stop execution of the script (if any) from<br>
which the StreamEdit command was executed.</li>
<li>Next -- Somewhat like the C keyword continue. When a Next command is<br>
executed, all pending changes are written out and no more addresses are<br>
matched against the current line; that is, StreamEdit immediately goes on to<br>
the next line without matching the rest of the rules against the current edit<br>
buffer.</li>
<li>Set variable text [-i | -a] -- Much like the MPW Shell Set command. The<br>
variable is set to the specified text. The -i and -a options allow text to be added<br>
to any existing setting of the variable at the start or the end, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output commands</h2>
<ul>
<li>Print [text] [-appendto | -to file] -- Writes output to a specified file. If<br>
text is empty, the current line is printed without modification. The -appendto<br>
and -to options write at the end of the file or overwrite the file, respectively.<br>
If no file is specified, standard output is used. If the file name is empty,<br>
nothing gets printed.</li>
<li>Option AutoDelete -- Deletes all input lines, leaving only output from<br>
Next and Print commands. You can get the same effect by specifying the -d<br>
option on the StreamEdit command line or by including this in the script:</li>
</ul>
<pre>/~/   Delete</pre>
<p>
The text arguments to these commands are usually literal text, denoted by single or<br>
double quotes. There are a few other forms as well:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An unquoted variable name can be used, in which case the variable is<br>
expanded; no brackets need be (or even may be) supplied.</li>
<li>A period means the current input line up to but not including the newline<br>
at the end.</li>
<li>As discussed in Issue 26, you can use reg. (Option-R) followed by a digit<br>
to mean the expression with that number matched in the pattern.</li>
<li>You can read text from a file with -from filename, which reads the next<br>
line of text from the specified file. The filename is usually literal text, but it<br>
could also be a variable, the current input line (denoted by a period), or a reg.<br>
expression.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>
Let's say you're the director of corporate communications at a major computer maker<br>
and, without any warning except for inventory backlogs larger than the gross national<br>
products of many developing countries, you experience a sudden transition in chief<br>
executive officers, corporate policy, and product line. Your quarterly report (10-Q)<br>
is due in the SEC's EDGAR database tomorrow. Fortunately the SEC requires the<br>
cutting-edge ASCII format for its filings, and you realize that you can automate 90% of<br>
the tedious changes with a single StreamEdit script.
</p>
<pre># Change nickname of CEO
/Diesel/
Replace // 'Flyboy'
# Change corporate policy
/1,$/
Replace /capture market share/ 'survive'

# Remove lines referring to obsolete products
/PowerTalk/ || /eWorld/
Delete

# Change developer relations strategy
/third-party developers/
Replace /evangelize/ 'listen to'

# Mark lines referring to old schedules
# with a distinctive string at the start
# of the line for manual editing later
/1996/
Insert 'WHOOPS: '

# Add new final line of report
[[infinity]]
Append 'May God have mercy on our souls.'</pre>

<h2>CONTROL YOURSELF</h2>
<p>
StreamEdit is almost too powerful. People have used it for everything, including<br>
pretty-printing source code, converting files to HTML, and postprocessing object files<br>
for dynamic linking tools. If you use it for finding incriminating passages in<br>
coworkers' e-mail, karma may get you, but the limitations of the tool won't. Use your<br>
powers for good rather than evil, and a grateful world will thank you.
