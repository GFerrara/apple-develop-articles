The people at ACOT SM (Apple's Classroom of Tomorrow) recently offered me the<br>
opportunity to work on another of their cool projects. I'll tell you all about the<br>
project, but--as usual--I'll also veer off into some wild philosophical speculation<br>
about computers and programming. So please fasten your seat belts and keep your head<br>
and arms inside the magazine at all times.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;ACOT was working on a research project in mobile computing: by combining GRiDPAD<br>
&#174; computers (notebook MS-DOS machines with pen-based input) and tiny wireless<br>
modems, they had created a unit that could be carried around easily in the field and that<br>
was continuously connected with other identical units. The software they were<br>
developing to run on these machines was a sort of collaborative spreadsheet, so that<br>
many separate users could enter and edit data simultaneously, and everyone would be<br>
updated continuously. They were going to give these units to kids at an elementary<br>
school in Tucson, Arizona, and send 'em out in the desert to collect various kinds of<br>
environmental data (temperature, pH, location, number of cacti, and so on). The idea<br>
was this: the kids would be able to see not only their own data, but how their data fit<br>
into the big picture. Presumably learning is enhanced when a person can see multiple<br>
levels of meaning side by side, because the mental "level switching" that has to happen<br>
to discern interdependencies can happen faster.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;In addition to the spreadsheet, they wanted a user-configurable graphing tool that<br>
would enable the user to plot any available value against any other, and to label the<br>
data points with a third variable to get a crude sort of a 3-D graph. This is another<br>
potentially powerful thing: being able to see the same set of data represented in two<br>
different ways side by side should enhance the understanding of the data and how it<br>
relates to reality. ACOT was running out of time and needed someone to write the<br>
graphing tool. In return for taking on this project I'd get a trip to Tucson to assist in<br>
the field trials. It sounded great: I love to program graphics, I have a good friend in<br>
Tucson I haven't seen in years, I'd get to learn all about a pen-based computer, and I'd<br>
have a chance to participate in some really interesting research.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Unfortunately, this was at a time when my workload, which waxes and wanes over the<br>
quarter, was on a steep rise. I had less than ten days to write this graphing tool, and I<br>
had to maintain some semblance of responsibility to my regular job. I knew perfectly<br>
well that if I took this project it would mean some late night and weekend hacking<br>
(something I increasingly try to avoid, at least for code that relates to work), and it<br>
would also mean working on an MS-DOS machine, something I had hoped to adroitly<br>
sidestep forever. Ah well, what's life without a little adventure? I took it.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Suddenly there I was, sitting in front of this strange machine made by Toshiba, all<br>
softly textured gray plastic and glowing plasma orange, surrounded by about thirty<br>
pounds of documentation, and the screen says something like "C:\GRID\BIN&gt;." Yikes!<br>
What have I done? I'm a Macintosh guy. I can get around OK on UNIX &#174; , thanks to a<br>
class I took once, but I've never touched an MS-DOS machine in my life, believe it or<br>
not. Now I'm not going to write yet another MS-DOS slam fromthe Macintosh<br>
perspective, but there are two lasting impressions I want to share. First, it took me<br>
almost half an hour to copy one directory of files into another the first time I tried,<br>
and I'll never forget it. Second, batch files are pretty handy.
</p>
<p>
Mercifully, I didn't have to spend much time in MS-DOS itself. I used Borland's Turbo<br>
C &#174; to do the actual development work, and it's a lot like THINK C, my preferred<br>
compiler on the Macintosh. Also, the programming interface for the GRiDPAD is very<br>
Macintosh-like, so aside from some syntactic differences I felt pretty much at home<br>
writing the code. In order to finish on time, though, I did have to go on a rather severe<br>
coding binge.
</p>
<p>
You know that feeling that you get around the sixth or eighth or tenth hour of nonstop<br>
digital interaction? Strange tensions, displacement, a weird urgency enclosing every<br>
movement, feeling compelled and repulsed simultaneously . . . you've all been there,<br>
I'm sure. Isn't it bizarre that computers can create such visceral reactions? Maybe if<br>
you do <i> anything</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;nonstop for a long time like that it would feel the same, but somehow<br>
I don't think so.
</p>
<p>
Programming is, at least partially, the ability and/or desire to force your mind to be <br>
<i>completely </i> literal. I have a pet theory that the reason programming is so difficult for<br>
many people, and the reason it induces such a strange mind state, is that it's a<br>
fundamentally different way of thinking that's not at all natural and must be<br>
consciously donned, like a hat that doesn't fit. You know how it sometimes takes a while<br>
to get fully into it, and once you're there it takes a while to come out of it? My wife<br>
still struggles with that: she doesn't understand that I am in a sort of trance, holding a<br>
whole strange world inside my head that is at odds with reality. She'll ask me a simple<br>
question, like what should we eat for dinner or have I let the dogs out recently, and it<br>
sometimes takes a full ten or fifteen seconds before I can react coherently. And it's not<br>
that I'm ignoring her. I just don't have room in my poor overburdened brain for the<br>
real world: it's been crowded out by the digital one. And unfortunately, by coming out<br>
long enough to answer her, I've lost a lot of ground. It will take another twenty minutes<br>
to get back to where I was. I <i> don't</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;think, though, that programming has to do that to<br>
people forever: it's just that our method of telling computers what to do is still very<br>
crude and cumbersome.
</p>
<p>
How can computers be so . . . I don't know, profound? I mean, they're only machines,<br>
right? And they only do one thing really well--they can add--but boy, are they good at<br>
it! They can add circles around anything else on the planet. Big circles. And somehow<br>
that makes them into what they are: these fluid, configurable, multipurpose tools and<br>
toys. You forget, and rightly so, that they're just adding machines on steroids. I once<br>
heard Todd Rundgren give a talk at a local SIGGRAPH meeting, and he made the point<br>
that computing itself is a poorly understood thing. He compared computers to the<br>
handles on tools: if you put a handle on a rock, you've got a hammer. Computers are<br>
like handles, but we don't yet know what they're handles to, and I suspect that we won't<br>
really know for a long time, if ever. It sure is a lot of fun, though, to grab that handle<br>
and start swinging!
</p>
<p>
Well, I can't tell you the end of the ACOT story, 'cause it hasn't happened yet, but<br>
maybe a future column will pick up where this one leaves off. My little graphing tool<br>
plugged into the spreadsheet with a minimum of hassle, thankfully, and it seems to be<br>
just what they wanted. Next week we get to hand our newly forged handle to the kids and<br>
see what they bash into. It might be anticlimactic-- maybe they'll just treat it like a<br>
fancy pad of paper--but maybe, just maybe, their minds will light up when they grab<br>
on.

<p><b>DAVE JOHNSON</b> has the best toy collection of anyone around.&nbsp;&nbsp;He says that his<br>
favorites either make cool noises, fly, do something surprising, or have just the<br>
right number of exclamation points in the product description. His Humming Bee (a<br>
rubber band stretched over a cheap wooden frame on the end of a string) hums<br>
when you whirl it over your head; Mike Stone's Amazing dip-er-doTM Stunt Plane<br>
defies gravity (it's a weighted paper plane that only does tight loops, so no matter<br>
which way you throw it, it always comes back to you); and the rattleback-- this<br>
one's so surprising that Scientific American had to publish something about it<br>
(see the article in <i>Roundabout: The Physics of Rotation in the Everyday World</i> by Jearl<br>
Walker, 1985). But his favorite toy of all is his Macintosh, because it makes<br>
cool noises, flies (well, figuratively), and does surprising things all at once. When<br>
he's not playing with his (and everyone else's) toys, he enjoys redwoods (wherever he<br>
may find them), dogs (his own in particular), clear blue (sky and water),<br>
escapist fiction (science and otherwise), and </td>complex mechanical contraptions. *</td></tr></table></p>
