&nbsp;OK, so you're cruising your source like a madman trying to get all those little System<br>
7.0 changes in before that target ship date (whatever it is this week), and you notice<br>
that the items you've added to the Page Setup/Print dialogs don't have any Balloon<br>
HelpTM--you know, those items like Reverse Pages, Print Hidden Text, or even Use<br>
Fractional Font Widths. (Coming up with meaningful names for these items, in four<br>
words or less, was a little tricky.) But now there's help, literally, in System 7.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Great! Then you remember that there wasn't a simple Printing Manager call to add<br>
those items to the dialogs. You had to resort to the technique described in Technical<br>
Note #95, How to Add Items to the Print Dialogs. As you remember, it used a set of<br>
procedures that modified the Printing Manager's (that is, the selected print driver's)<br>
dialog item list (DITL) resource.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Remembering the actual code in Tech Note #95, you consider that the Standard File<br>
package shipped with 7.0 has a new call that allows you to append things to its dialog,<br>
including Help Manager resources. Feeling relieved, you think, "Ah, there must be a<br>
similar call in the new Pri . . ." But no, the new printing architecture has been<br>
delayed. A quick scan shows that there isn't even a Printing Manager chapter in<i>Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i> Volume VI! Help!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not as bad as you might expect. If you consult Tech<br>
Note #95, you'll see the rather husky AppendDITL procedure. This procedure is called<br>
to append the items that you want to add to the dialog item list being used by the<br>
particular dialog (Page Setup or Print). 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The sample code from Tech Note #95 calls some Printing Manager routines that let<br>
you get in after the DITL resource has been loaded, but before the dialog has been<br>
displayed. You add your items to the resource in memory<i>without</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;calling either<br>
ChangedResource or WriteResource. The driver then uses this DITL and displays your<br>
items. Once the dialog is dismissed, the resource is purged, and the driver doesn't even<br>
know you were there. Life is good. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;As you've probably guessed by now, you're going to have to append to the Help Manager<br>
dialog item help ('hdlg') resource in the same way that you appended to the DITL<br>
resource. You simply scan the list to the end, and then append the appropriate items.<br>
The 'hdlg' resource is purged in the same way as the DITL resource, so once again you<br>
make no permanent changes. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;On the next page is the definition of the Append2hdlg procedure. We start by getting<br>
both 'hdlg' resources into memory. It's safe to assume the source 'hdlg' resource hasn't<br>
been loaded yet, but we use the SetResLoad trick on the destination in case it has<br>
already been loaded. (The SetResLoad trick is a method for determining whether a<br>
resource has already been loaded. This trick is important, since in cases where the<br>
resource has already been loaded by the system, you don't want to unload it or<br>
permanently change any of its resource attributes.) The trick works like this: You<br>
SetResLoad to false so that the Resource Manager doesn't load the resource data;<br>
instead, it just creates an empty resource handle that can be passed to routines like<br>
GetResInfo. You then call GetResource on the resource you're looking for. If the handle<br>
returned is empty (that is, points to nil), you know the resource isn't already in<br>
memory. If the handle returned is not empty, something else (like the system) has<br>
already loaded it before you called GetResource. In this example, since we use<br>
HGetState and HSetState to preserve the resource attributes, and we want the resource<br>
to be left in memory when we're done, we don't really need to know if it was already<br>
loaded. The SetResLoad code is included for anyone who is planning on modifying this<br>
code to do more.
</p>
<p>
Next we initialize our locals. We want to point srcPtr to the place in the source<br>
resource that we want to start copying from. To do this, we need to point past the<br>
"missing item." The size of the item is stored in the resource just after the resource<br>
header. We first use srcPtr to get the size (in bytes) of the missing item. Using that<br>
size, we can calculate the starting location for the copy. We don't actually initialize<br>
srcPtr yet, since resizing the destination handle could move memory. Next we<br>
initialize dstPtr and dstLength. In the process, we resize dstHdl to make room for the<br>
items we're going to append. Once SetHandleSize has been called, we also initialize<br>
srcPtr. Now that srcPtr and dstPtr are set up, we use BlockMove to copy the new items<br>
into the destination resource. After unlocking the resource handles, we update the<br>
numItems field of the destination resource so that the Help Manager will know how<br>
many items we added. Finally, we release the source resource. We don't want to release<br>
the destination, since our changes would then be lost.

<pre>void Append2hdlg(srcResID, dstResID)
short   srcResID, dstResID;
{
    Handle              srcHdl, dstHdl;
    Ptr                 srcPtr, dstPtr;
    short               srcLength, dstLength;

    SignedByte      dstHState;
   
    srcHdl = GetResource('hdlg', srcResID);
    if (srcHdl != nil) {
        SetResLoad(false);  /* System resource, make sure it's not */
        dstHdl = GetResource('hdlg', dstResID); /* already loaded. */
        SetResLoad(true);
        if (*dstHdl == 0)
            dstHdl = GetResource('hdlg', dstResID);
        dstHState = HGetState(dstHdl);
       
        if (dstHdl != nil) {
            srcPtr = (Ptr)*srcHdl + sizeof(hdlgHeader);
            missingItmSz = *((IntPtr)srcPtr);
            srcLength = GetHandleSize(srcHdl) - (sizeof(hdlgHeader)
                - missingItmSz);

            dstLength = GetHandleSize(dstHdl);
            SetHandleSize(dstHdl, dstLength + srcLength);
            if (MemError() != noErr) {
                DebugStr("\pMemError");
                            /* Use this error handler, go to jail. */
                ExitToShell();              /* It's the law! */
            }
            dstPtr = (Ptr)*dstHdl + dstLength;
            srcPtr = (Ptr)*srcHdl + sizeof(hdlgHeader) +
                missingItmSz;

            HLock(srcHdl);
            HLock(dstHdl);

            BlockMove(srcPtr, dstPtr, srcLength);

            HUnlock(srcHdl);
            HSetState(dstHdl, dstHState);

            ((hdlgHeaderPtr)*dstHdl)-&gt;hdlgNumItems +=
                ((hdlgHeaderPtr)*srcHdl)-&gt;hdlgNumItems;
        }
    }
    ReleaseResource(srcHdl);

<p>
So that's about it. Append2hdlg is a lot smaller than AppendDITL because we don't<br>
actually need to parse the contents of the 'hdlg' resource. Although it's another piece of<br>
code to be added to your application, this should be quite painless, unlike other<br>
Printing Manager exercises. Don't forget to read the Help Manager chapter of <i> Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume VI for guidelines on the contents of your Help Manager balloons. See<br>
ya next time . . .

<b>SCOTT "ZZ" ZIMMERMAN</b> loves Disneyland--we think it's because he's really a<br>
cartoon character at heart. When asked, he admitted to wanting to be Captain Hook<br>
when he grew up. His favorite ride is Peter Pan because it's romantic, cool, dark, and<br>
the main character is a kid who never grew up. Except for the romantic, cool, and dark<br>
parts, it reminds him a lot of life at Apple. When he's at Apple he makes sure he drinks<br>
at least 15 gallons of Mountain Dew a day--he says it powers the mechanism for his<br>
retractable Barbie Doll hair. In closing, we'll leave you with his favorite question,<br>
"How can I miss you if you won't leave?"*
