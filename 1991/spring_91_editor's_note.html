<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>
<h2>LOUELLA PIZZUTI PASSES TO CAROLINE ROSE</h2>

</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Dear Readers,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Starting with this issue of <i> develop</i> , Louella has passed the editorial baton to yours<br>
truly, Caroline Rose. If the name sounds familiar, it's because you may have seen it in<br>
the credits for <i> Inside Macintosh</i> , Volumes I-III. At one point during my<br>
three-and-a-half-year stint as the primary author and editor of that magnum opus, I<br>
interviewed an inexperienced but delightfully cocky young woman who convinced me<br>
that she could do as good a job as anyone of formatting the <i> IM </i> files on the Macintosh&#174;<br>
(they were created on the Apple &#174; III).&nbsp;&nbsp;She was hired, and ended up being a great help<br>
to the project as well as a great friend. You'll also find her name in the credits:<br>
"assisted by" none other than Louella Pizzuti.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;But the time came for me to move on. I went looking for jobs and found the next<br>
company I would work for (puns intended). After four years as that next company's<br>
Manager of Publications and a year as its Editor in Chief, I was ready to move on again.<br>
I put the word out at Apple and got a phone call from Louella, with whom I had fallen<br>
woefully out of touch over the years. Now the friendship has been renewed and we're<br>
working together once again--this time with her as my boss!
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;After a brief orientation (and a wonderful "welcome" lunch) on my first day back at<br>
Apple, I was steered into a meeting at which I had to immediately make my first<br>
decision as <i> develop</i> 's new Editor in Chief. Actually, it was sort of a trick question,<br>
since everyone present had already agreed on the answer. Fortunately, I was of like<br>
mind, and as a result we're calling this simply Issue 6 rather than continue with the<br>
previous issue's use of "Volume 2" (which snuck in while Louella was out with a bad<br>
back). So for those of you who are collecting the whole set (knowing it will be of<br>
inestimable value someday), take note that the previous issue's number should be<br>
reassigned according to the following formula:
</p>
<pre>int
CalculateIssueNumber(int Volume, int Issue)
{
    return ((Volume - 1) * 4) + Issue;
}</pre>
<p>
Or, for you Pascal types:
</p>
<pre>FUNCTION CalculateIssueNumber (Volume, Issue: INTEGER): INTEGER;
BEGIN
     CalculateIssueNumber := ((Volume - 1) * 4) + Issue;
END;</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;You may notice other changes introduced in this issue. We hope you'll agree they're<br>
changes for the better; if not, be sure to let us know. Please also let us know if you'd be<br>
interested in writing an article for <i>develop </i> yourself. Do you have any nifty code you'd<br>
like to share with the rest of the Apple developer world? Have you yearned to have<br>
your own silly bio grace these pages (not to mention your photo)? Think of how<br>
pleased your mother would be to receive a copy.
</p>
<p>
I'll leave you with a riddle: I entered this entire editorial without pressing a single key<br>
on the keyboard or clicking the mouse button. I was as quiet as a mouse (the furry<br>
kind). How did I do this? And furthermore, why? Stay tuned for the answer in our next<br>
issue.

<b>&nbsp;Caroline Rose Editor</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>CAROLINE ROSE </b>has been writing computer documentation ever since "a computer at<br>
your fingertips" meant timesharing a mainframe. After a seven-year digression into<br>
programming, she returned to her first love--writing--and was given the<br>
opportunity to document the inner workings of a funny little computer named<br>
Macintosh. The result was a three-volume tome that, in its hard-cover edition, was<br>
the first technical manual to qualify as a lethal weapon (and we don't mean by boring<br>
people to death). In what proved to be another digression, she left Apple to launch<br>
NeXT's documentation effort. Returning after a five-year hiatus, she's thrilled to be<br>
back at Apple among friends and foe alike. For pleasure outside of work, Caroline reads<br>
voraciously, swims fanatically, dances, sings, plays Scrabble, hugs her cat, and much<br>
more.
