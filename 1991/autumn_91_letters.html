<b>THREADS PACKAGING</b><br>
I'm impressed with threads and futures and I think they'll be of real use to me in a<br>
commercial product I'm working on. I have a simple problem. I don't think we can ship<br>
your INIT with our application. Doing so constitutes an unnecessary invitation to<br>
support hassles (as well as a just plain unaesthetic package, in my opinion). Is there<br>
any chance that you could repackage the current threads and futures stuff as straight<br>
libraries (in THINK C form, please)?<br>
--Richard Reich<br>
<p>
<i>The latest version of threads and futures, which is on this issue's CD, has been</i><br>
<i>augmented so that you have your choice of how to package the code. Just use the INIT as</i><br>
<i>is, or copy the code resources into your application. Let me know if you need any more</i><br>
<i>help. My number is (408)974-0355.</i><br>

<b>THREADS IN A BLACK BOX</b><br>
I was really pleased to see the article on threads in Issue 6 of <i> develop. </i> There have<br>
been several instances in my programming experience on the Macintosh when I had<br>
some long involved processing that was not easily restructured to pass control to the<br>
interface or to other applications. The Threads Package seems like the best way to<br>
handle this problem that we are likely to have without major changes in the Macintosh<br>
OS.
</p>
<p>
However, I was disappointed to discover that Semaphore, one of the examples from the<br>
CD, crashes. If you click before the program is finished, it exits normally, but if you<br>
let it run its course, it crashes after it's done beeping. I hope that a corrected version<br>
of the Threads Package will be available on a future <i>develop </i> CD.
</p>
<p>
If the source code for this package had been provided on the disc, I would at least have a<br>
chance of understanding the source of the bug and correcting it. Instead I must rely on<br>
the possibility that a corrected version of the object code will be provided with a<br>
future issue of <i> develop. </i> We can count on Apple to provide updates for object libraries<br>
supplied with MPW; hence we have no need for the source. Can we rely on the same<br>
level of support for object libraries without source distributed on<i>develop </i> CDs?
</p>
<p>
I've seen <i>develop </i> evolve from a journal with good articles on programming techniques<br>
into a journal with articles that were basically blurbs for source code, and now into a<br>
journal with articles that are blurbs for black boxes provided on the CD. I still think <br>
<i>develop </i> is an extremely useful resource for Macintosh programmers. However, I urge<br>
you to try to include source code when you possibly can.
</p>
<p>
At any rate I am looking forward to seeing a corrected version of the Threads Package<br>
in a future issue of <i>develop</i> --I intend to give it a try even if it <i> is </i> a black box!<br>
--Dennis C. De Mars
</p>
<p>
<i>You're right, the Semaphore example crashes, and it is a bug in the Threads Package. I</i><br>
<i>guess I always clicked out early during the final testing. Issue 7 has a follow-up</i><br>
<i>article to Threads that includes an updated (and fixed) Threads Package.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>To address your concern about </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;develop<i> heading toward "black boxiness": The Threads</i><br>
<i>Package is the only</i> develop <i>article ever that hasn't included source code. We debated</i><br>
<i>for a long time whether that was OK, and many people expressed the same concerns you</i><br>
<i>did. We decided that Threads was unique enough and useful enough to justify it. The</i><br>
<i>reaction has been extremely positive, so I think we did the right thing.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I assure you that we won't make a habit of featuring black boxes, and that as long as</i><br>
<i>Michael Gough keeps supporting Threads, the latest CD will contain the latest version.</i><br>
<i>Threads is not an official Apple product, though, so use it in your application at your</i><br>
<i>own risk. It's possible that we will be able to publish the source code someday.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Thank you for taking the time to write! People's comments are the best barometer we</i><br>
<i>have for how we're doing.--Dave Johnson</i>

<b>CD SETUP (AND MORE!) ON CD</b><br>
How about including on the <i>Developer Essentials</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;CD-ROM a copy of the latest version<br>
of the <i> CD Setup </i> disc that comes with the AppleCD SC drive? It would be a convenient<br>
way to get a current version of the AppleCD SC software, and a lot of people who are<br>
browsing your CD have an AppleCD SC anyway.<br>
--Kazimir C. Stusinski
</p>
<p>
<i>The latest version of the CD Setup disc is on this issue's CD. Note that it's now the</i><br>
<i>"Developer CD Series" disc, the same disc that Apple Associates and Partners receive.</i><br>
<i>The contents of Developer Essentials was only a subset of the Developer CD Series disc;</i><br>
<i>now you can have it all!</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>EVASIVE SNIPPETS</b><br>
The Snippets section of <i> develop </i> always has such neat-sounding code fragments in it . .<br>
. if only I could find them! I always peruse the <i> Developer CD Series</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;disc that arrives<br>
with each issue of <i> develop,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;but many of the snippets can't be found, either by my<br>
old-fashioned hand searching or by using the HyperCard&#174; stack that, hopefully, really<br>
does have a complete index of the contents.
</p>
<p>
It's safe to say that it seems that most can't be found. Assuming they <i> are </i><br>
there--somewhere--I'd like to suggest that the code you list in the Snippets section be<br>
included in the <i> develop </i> folder. Even a directory or stack in that folder that would<br>
point me to them would be a terrific savings in time. Keep up the good work!<br>
--Chris Gibson
</p>
<p>
<i>Snippets have had a rough time. They didn't make it onto the Issue 6 CD at all. And,</i><br>
<i>although they were on the Issue 7 CD, they were not mentioned in the Contents Catalog</i><br>
<i>stack on the Developer CD Series disc. They can be found with the DTS sample code.</i><br>
<i>That seems the most logical place for them, since they're not strictly a</i> develop <i>thing:</i><br>
<i>they come from DTS (Developer Technical Support); we just describe them (and we've</i><br>
<i>decided to stop that--they're now described in a text file in with the snippets). Sorry</i><br>
<i>for the confusion!</i><br>
<i>--Dave Johnson</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>ONE UGLY DUDE</b><br>
I just wanted to comment that I was totally shocked when I saw Harry Chesley's picture<br>
in <i> develop</i> this month. " This is one ugly dude," I thought. Perhaps his picture was<br>
sabotaged. Or maybe he really is a Vulcan with three Adam's apples!<br>
--Dan Wood
</p>
<p>
<i>Actually, that picture wasn't supposed to be printed at all. It's top secret, the result of</i><br>
<i>an internal Apple project in the area of desktop bioengineering.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>But now that the cat's out of the bag, I guess I can mention that we're expecting to ship</i><br>
<i>the product second quarter next year. It attaches to the SCSI port of the Macintosh. You</i><br>
<i>stick one of your fingers in a hole in the front, and it modifies your DNA. The actual</i><br>
<i>physiological changes take about a week to materialize.</i><br>
<i>--Harry Chesley</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>P.S. The three Adam's apples are a bug, which we're planning to fix in the next rev.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>WHERE'S LOUELLA, REALLY?</b><br>
I sent mail to your predecessor, Louella, at louella@applelink.apple.com, but your<br>
system denied knowing about her. Any help you could give me in addressing e-mail to<br>
her would be very much appreciated.<br>
--An Admirer<i>In Issue 7, I joked that Louella had retired to raise flowers in Holland.</i><br>
<i>Well, I was close: she has left Apple to paint and write until her money runs out. We'll</i><br>
<i>miss her terribly but will remember her always as our "Spirited Guide." She'll be</i><br>
<i>living wherever the living is easy (and cheap), but letters will always get to her</i><br>
<i>through this address: 932 Rosette Court, Sunnyvale, CA 94086. Sorry, she will no</i><br>
<i>longer be electronically plugged in.</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>
