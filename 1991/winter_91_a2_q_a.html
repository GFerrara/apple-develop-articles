<h2>APPLE II Q &amp; A</h2>
<h1>APPLE II DEVELOPER TECHNICAL SUPPORT</h1>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>The </i> Apple IIGS&#174; GS/OS Reference<i>, page 43, alludes to&nbsp;&nbsp;"an enhanced ProDOS &#174; 8</i><br>
<i>QUIT call, which contains a pathname to an application to be launched." However, I find</i><br>
<i>no mention of this enhancement in the </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;ProDOS 8 Technical Reference<i>. How do I use</i><br>
<i>this call?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>The enhanced ProDOS 8 QUIT call allows you to quit to another application if GS/OS or<br>
ProDOS 16 has been booted. The enhanced ProDOS 8 QUIT call requires either of the<br>
following four-count parameter blocks:
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
<i><code>Standard</code></i>
</p>
<pre style="margin-top: 0px;">dc.b $00     ;quit type
               ;normal
dc.w $0000   ;null
dc.b $00     ;null
dc.w $0000   ;null</pre>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
<i><code>Extended</code></i>
</p>
<pre style="margin-top: 0px;">dc.b $EE     ;quit type
               ;enhanced
dc.w path    ;addr of
               ;launch
               ;pathname
dc.b $00     ;reserved
dc.w $0000   ;reserved


path str 'myprog.sys16'</pre>
<p>
GS/OS patches ProDOS 8 to get control on a QUIT and launches the next program if the<br>
quit type is $EE. The code to do this is not part of ProDOS 8; it doesn't fit in the kernel,<br>
and it can't go in the "quit code" because program selectors swap that out. The enhanced<br>
Quit call, therefore, works only when GS/OS has been booted.

<p>
<b>Q</b><i>What's the difference between Apple II GS System Software versions 5.0.3 and</i><br>
<i>5.0.4?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Apple IIGS System 5.0.4 includes the following changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>TOOL.SETUP for System Software 3.2 in May 1987 changed QDStartUp to<br>
make the cursor image handle safe and has now been changed for ROM 03 as<br>
well. </li>
<li>QuickDraw Auxiliary no longer returns bogus errors for SeedFill and<br>
CalcMask in pure 640 mode, and a low-level stack imbalance has been<br>
corrected. </li>
<li>The ImageWriter&#174; and ImageWriter LQ drivers now spool to the User<br>
Path if the system was booted over AppleShare&#174;. A bug concerning memory<br>
allocation has been fixed, and the drivers now check errors more robustly. </li>
<li>The SCSI Manager no longer resets the SCSI bus when the Manager is<br>
started. </li>
<li>The AppleShare FST now saves and restores the correct QuickDraw direct<br>
page locations when shielding the cursor to draw the AppleShare arrows. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q</b><i>What do I need to get started with&nbsp;&nbsp;MPW IIGS?</i></p>
<p>
<b>A</b>MPW IIGS is a set of tools and languages that creates Apple II and Apple IIGS programs<br>
and object code under the Macintosh MPW development environment. The system<br>
requirements for MPW are detailed in<i>APDAlog&#174;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;in the MPW product description. In<br>
addition to MPW and a system suitable for it, you need the MPW IIGS Tools package,<br>
which contains necessary development tools like the linker and other useful tools such<br>
as the resource compiler, object module dumper, and ProDOS file duplicator. You will<br>
also need the MPW IIGS language of your choice--currently assembly, C, or Pascal. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>If a task in the Heartbeat Interrupt Task queue has not yet been executed (the tick</i><br>
<i>counter has not yet reached zero), is it possible to store a zero into the</i><code> TaskCnt </code><i>field</i><br>
<i>to keep the system from ever executing the task?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>This will work fine. If you know where the count word is, then you can set it to zero<br>
to prevent yourself from being called. The system does not keep this information in a<br>
separate buffer; it checks the value in the queue header each pass through the<br>
Heartbeat queue,so if you were at 200 one pass, and then 0 the next, the system will<br>
not be bothered because it does not remember the previous value. And because the task<br>
is not executed unless the system itself decrements the count to zero, storing a zero<br>
into the<code>TaskCnt</code> field is a fine way to prevent a task from executing. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Can run queue tasks remove themselves?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Yes, run queue tasks can call Desk Manager<code> RemoveFromRunQ </code>on themselves without<br>
difficulty.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Can QuickDraw II Auxiliary's</i><code> CopyPixels </code><i>call scale pixel images beyond</i><code>maxWidth</code>?
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>No, but you can use the QuickDraw II<code> SetBufDims </code>call to increase the size of the<br>
QuickDraw buffer to beyond what was specified for the<code> maxWidth </code>variable in the<br>
<code>QDStartUp </code>routine.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>How do I port my Macintosh HyperCard &#174; stack to run with HyperCard II GS?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>You can use HyperMover TM, which is available on AppleLink<i> &#174;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;on developer CDs. <br>
HyperMover allows HyperCard 1.2.5 stacks from the Macintosh to run with little or<br>
no modification on the Apple II GS with HyperCard IIGS. HyperMover consists of two<br>
stacks, one for the Macintosh and one for the Apple II GS. HyperMover for the<br>
Macintosh creates a folder containing files that describe the stack you wish to convert<br>
to the II GS. This folder and the files it contains are then transferred to the II GS via<br>
Apple File Exchange or an AppleTalk network. HyperMover for the IIGS then rebuilds a<br>
stack as close as possible to the original stack using the files contained in this folder.<br>
The most noticeable difference between the original and the rebuilt stack will be in the<br>
graphics. Because the II GS and the Macintosh have such different sized screen<br>
displays, the graphics and objects of the rebuilt stack must be scaled to fit the II GS<br>
screen, resulting in some loss of detail.
</p>
<p>
HyperMover contains several features designed to make the rebuilt stack as useful and<br>
as close to the original stack as possible. It can create scaled representations of<br>
Macintosh pictures, convert Macintosh sounds to IIGS sounds and Macintosh icons to<br>
IIGS icons, and transfer all HyperCard objects including backgrounds, cards, buttons,<br>
and fields and their attributes. However, because HyperMover is a stack, it cannot<br>
convert XCMD/XFCNs and cannot fix scripts that need specific Macintosh screen<br>
coordinates to function. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Is HyperTalk the same in HyperCard II GS as in Macintosh HyperCard?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Generally, HyperTalk&#174; on the Apple II GS is the same as HyperCard 1.2.5 HyperTalk<br>
on the Macintosh, but the HyperTalk on the Apple II GS has an extended command set to<br>
support the&nbsp;&nbsp;features available in the Apple II GS environment. New commands are<br>
included for setting color properties&nbsp;&nbsp;of objects, painting properties, and printing. A<br>
new property for buttons called the family property also has&nbsp;&nbsp;been added.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Does HyperCard IIGS provide for extending the HyperTalk language?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Yes. External commands and functions, which are usually referred to as XCMDs and<br>
XFCNs, or externals as a general group, are functionally identical in the Macintosh<br>
HyperTalk and Apple IIGS HyperTalk software environments. XCMDs and XFCNs<br>
provide for extensions to the existing HyperTalk language and are called using the same<br>
methods as those for Macintosh HyperTalk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifications have to be made, however,<br>
to move existing source code for Macintosh externals into the Apple IIGS environment.<br>
HyperTalk callback procedures and interfaces for the Apple IIGSdiffer slightly from<br>
Macintosh HyperTalk.
