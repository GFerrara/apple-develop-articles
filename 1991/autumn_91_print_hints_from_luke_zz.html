With the release of System 7 comes a new release of the LaserWriter driver, version<br>
7.0. Yes, the great implementors (GIs) have once again created another version of this<br>
driver. This version supports TrueType fonts, it's 32-bit clean, it has the new<br>
PostScript file-saving capability, and it remembers the last setting of the Black &amp;<br>
White and Color/Grayscale print buttons (HOORAY!!).
</p>
<p>
Along comes our hero, Dudley Developer. He's been using the new CopyMask and<br>
CopyDeepMask calls that are available in QuickDraw in System 7 and he's very excited<br>
about printing his new images with the LaserWriter driver. He assumes that since<br>
QuickDraw supports the new CopyMask and CopyDeepMask calls, the LaserWriter<br>
driver 7.0 will also support them.
</p>
<p>
Bad assumption. Our hero has not been keeping up with current events. He has not even<br>
read "QuickDraw's CopyBits Procedure: Better Than Ever in System 7.0" in Issue 6<br>
of<i>develop</i> . If he had, he would know that, like previous versions of the LaserWriter<br>
driver, LaserWriter driver 7.0 does not directly support the CopyMask and<br>
CopyDeepMask calls. 
</p>
<p>
So, in his ignorance, our hero creates a few pictures with the new QuickDraw calls,<br>
and sends them off to the LaserWriter. Time goes by, paper comes out, but the picture<br>
doesn't look the same as it did on his monitor. It has lost some of the cool effects from<br>
CopyMask and CopyDeepMask. 
</p>
<p>
Why, he wonders, won't LaserWriter driver 7.0 print his images with the same<br>
effects provided by the CopyMask and CopyDeepMask calls? What was Apple thinking<br>
when they created LaserWriter driver 7.0? How could they release a driver that<br>
doesn't support the new 32-bit QuickDraw calls?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do they expect him to print his<br>
new cool pictures created in System 7 with these calls?
</p>
<p>
To attempt to understand the problem, Dudley looks between the covers of the Adobe<br>
red book (a.k.a. <i>PostScript Language Reference Manual</i> by Adobe Systems). Even he<br>
knows transfer modes would be required to support the new calls--but alas, he doesn't<br>
find any information on them, because PostScript level 1 doesn't understand transfer<br>
modes. Unfortunately, the LaserWriter driver won't rewrite PostScript for you; it<br>
just merrily converts your QuickDraw calls into their equivalent PostScript call. The<br>
LaserWriter driver always uses the srcCopy transfer mode when it prints a pixel<br>
map, regardless of the mode used when the picture was created. (Why srcCopy?<br>
Because of the limitations of the color model and the lack of transfer mode support<br>
provided by PostScript level 1.)
</p>
<p>
There<i>is</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;a method that will allow Dudley to print the images he created, but as usual<br>
with printing, he'll need to do a little more work: he'll need to use GWorlds and<br>
PrGeneral. Since our hero is not familiar with using GWorlds, he decides to go back<br>
through his old issues of<i>develop</i> , hoping for an article. Luckily, he finds just what<br>
he's looking for in Issue 1: "Realistic Color for Real-World Applications" and "Braving<br>
Offscreen Worlds." And the CD contains the sample code that uses GWorlds.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after<br>
reading the articles and trying the code, Dudley is all set to create an off-screen world<br>
to hold his image. He realizes that to get the best print quality, he'll need to make the<br>
GWorld bigger than the picture on the screen. The GWorld should be the size of the<br>
grafPort returned by the application's call to PrOpenDoc, at the printer's resolution.<br>
Dudley knows he needs a device- independent method to acquire this information, and<br>
he knows he can get it by using PrGeneral's GetRslData opcode. And even better still, he<br>
remembers an article about using PrGeneral from Issue 3 of<i> develop</i> . The article was<br>
titled "Meet PrGeneral," and it contained complete sample code. Yippee!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After using<br>
the GetRslData opcode to determine the resolutions supported by the currently selected<br>
printer, he uses the SetRsl opcode to set the printer to the resolution he wants. When<br>
his application calls PrOpenDoc, the printer driver will return a grafPort that's sized<br>
correctly for the resolution he chose.
</p>
<p>
Next, Dudley creates the correctly sized off-screen world and draws his image using<br>
CopyMask or CopyDeepMask. He just needs to remember that since the CopyMask and<br>
CopyDeepMask calls are not saved in pictures, he needs to make the calls directly into<br>
his off-screen world (not relying on DrawPicture). So, when he's ready to print his<br>
image, Dudley uses CopyBits to copy it from his GWorld into the printer's grafPort<br>
with srcCopy. That's it; his totally cool image has been printed in living color (or<br>
anemic gray scales, if he's printing to the LaserWriter).
</p>
<p>
This wasn't so bad, but our hero is wondering--when will the GIs make this easier?<br>
When will all of this incompatibility between QuickDraw and the LaserWriter driver<br>
improve? That's a really good question. The GIs tell me things will probably not<br>
improve until the new printing architecture is released. In the meantime, you've got<br>
this way around the problem, and at least it isn't too ugly!

<b>PETE "LUKE" ALEXANDER</b> After taking almost a year to check out Ford Explorers<br>
in parking lots and dealerships, Luke has, in a surprise move, actually purchased one<br>
of his own. At SIGGRAPH in Las Vegas he ran into some Ford engineers; they were<br>
surprised, but not seriously hurt. They asked increduously, "Have you driven a Ford<br>
lately?" Luke left wondering what kind of inside information they had. He knew for<br>
sure, though, that the animation was his favorite part of the show-- which figures,<br>
since since he's so&nbsp;&nbsp;used to working with Zz, our resident cartoon character. Not<br>
surprisingly, the Las Vegas show he talked about the most had little to do with<br>
computers! He also enjoys the show at Gordon Biersch, a local brew pub known for its<br>
good beer and yuppie clientele. Luke says he goes there to see how yuppie scum lives,<br>
but every once in a while we think he already knows.*
