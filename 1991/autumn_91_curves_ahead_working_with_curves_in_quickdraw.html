<i>&nbsp;Imagine being able to build into your application the capability to draw freehand</i><br>
<i>curves. Imagine being able to save these curves so that they can be loaded into other</i><br>
<i>programs like MacDraw or printed using the LaserWriter. And imagine being given the</i><br>
<i>key to an abundant supply of previously defined curves to play with. Imagine no more .</i><br>
<i>. . this article reveals all.</i>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;QuickDraw is a heck of a fine drawing engine for the Macintosh, but it does have its<br>
limitations. In particular, it supports a limited set of geometric primitives for<br>
drawing: lines, rectangles, rounded- corner rectangles, ovals, arcs, and polygons (see<br>
Figure 1). If you want your application to provide the capability of drawing contours<br>
consisting of curves and straight lines, you're out of luck. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Sure, you can use the arc primitive to draw a curve, but if you want to connect the<br>
curve to anything, you've got a problem. An arc represents a segment of an ellipse and<br>
is specified by a bounding rectangle (defining the ellipse) and start and stop angles<br>
(see Figure 2). Because an arc is not specified by starting and ending points, it's hard<br>
to know the exact points where QuickDraw will begin and end drawing the arc. Thus,<br>
the arc does not lend itself to being combined with other arcs or lines.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;A more useful curve primitive would be one that describes its start and end positions<br>
as points. The quadratic B&#201;zier is just such a curve. Applications such as MacDraw&#174;<br>
use this type of curve to allow the drawing of freehand curves, and the Macintosh itself<br>
uses this type of curve in an internal procedure to describe TrueType fonts.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;In this article we give you the lowdown on the quadratic B&#201;zier. We show the coding<br>
and the data structures used by programs like MacDraw to draw this kind of curve, and<br>
we show how your application can interchange data about this kind of curve with<br>
MacDraw and with devices equipped with a PostScript&#174; interpreter. And since the<br>
quadratic B&#201;zier happens to be the same curve that TrueType uses (in combination<br>
with other shapes) to draw outline fonts, we show how to extract curve data from<br>
TrueType fonts.

<h2>&nbsp;DRAWING CURVES AND PATHS</h2>
<p>
The quadratic B&#201;zier has a couple of properties that make it useful as a basis for<br>
drawing curves in QuickDraw. First, it can be rotated easily by changing just the<br>
starting, ending, and middle points and not the underlying equation itself. Second, it<br>
can easily be subdivided into any number of shorter curves that become flatter and<br>
flatter, until in effect it can be drawn with a series of straight lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the basic<br>
technique for drawing a curve using the existing QuickDraw primitives is by <br>
subdividing the curve into a series of line segments. If you're interested in the<br>
mathematics behind this, see "Parametric Equations, Anyone?"
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;This section begins by showing sample C code that implements the subdivision<br>
algorithm that produces a curve. We then move on to consider how to produce a<br>
combination of curves and straight lines, known in the lingo as a<i>path</i> . Then we talk<br>
about how to combine paths to produce shapes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that for a curve, as for every<br>
geometric primitive in QuickDraw, you always have two options: you can either frame<br>
it or fill it. We show you how to do the framing; you can do the filling using the call<br>
FillPoly or PaintPoly.

</p>
<p>
<b>FRAMING A CURVE</b><br>
The code that implements the subdivision algorithm to produce a curve takes a value<br>
for the number of times the curve should be subdivided before it's drawn as straight<br>
lines. This number can be dynamically computed based on the size of the curve and the<br>
quality-versus-speed trade-off the application wants to make. The code uses<br>
fixed-point coordinates to maintain high precision during the subdivisions.
</p>
<p>
To begin, let's define a few macros to help us use fixed-point coordinates in an<br>
integer-based graphics system. 
</p>
<pre>#define FR(x)              ((x) + 0x8000 >> 16)
#define ff(x)               ((long)(x) << 16)
#define fmoveto(x,y)        MoveTo(FR(x), FR(y))
#define flineto(x,y)        LineTo(FR(x), FR(y))
#define AVE(a,b)            (((a) + (b)) / 2)

FR      The same as FixRound: takes a Fixed and makes it a short.
ff      The reverse of FixRound: takes a short and promotes it to a
        Fixed. 
fmoveto The same as MoveTo, but takes Fixed coordinates. 
flineto The same as LineTo, but takes Fixed coordinates. 
AVE     Averages two numbers, either Fixed, short, or long. </pre>
<p>
To represent fixed-point coordinates, we define a struct called point. Note that this is<br>
similar to QuickDraw's Point, but uses Fixed numbers instead of integers. 
</p>
<pre>typedef struct {
    Fixed x;
    Fixed y;
} point;</pre>
<p>
To represent a curve, we need three points: a start point, a control point, and an<br>
endpoint. (These correspond to<i>a, b,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;and<i> c</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;in Figure 3.)
</p>
<pre>typedef struct {
    point start;
    point control;
    point end;
} curve;</pre>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The function FrameCurve (below) draws a quadratic B&#201;zier using subdivision. If the<br>
level for the FrameCurve routine is 0, a LineTo (using flineto) operation is<br>
performed; otherwise, the curve is subdivided and FrameCurve is called recursively,<br>
once for the left half of the curve and once for the right. FrameCurve assumes the<br>
caller has already called fmoveto on the start point of the curve. The second routine,<br>
ExampleCurve, calls FrameCurve requesting four levels of subdividing. Thus, the final<br>
curve consists of 2^4, or 16, lines. It's shown in Figure 5.

    {   curve left, right;

        left.start = cur-&gt;start;
        left.control.x = AVE(cur-&gt;start.x, cur-&gt;control.x);

        ff(0)};

    FrameCurve(&amp;myCurve, 4);
}</pre>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;FRAMING A PATH</b><br>
Drawing contours such as font outlines requires drawing a combination of straight<br>
lines and curves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a combination is known as a<i>path</i> . A path is defined by the<br>
following data structure:
</p>
<pre> typedef struct {
    long    vectors;        /* The number of points in the path. */
    long    controlBits[anyNumber];
    point   vector[anyNumber];  /* The points. */
} path;</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;A path is similar to a polygon except that it has a set of control bits that determine<br>
whether each point is on or off the curve. There's one control bit for each point,<br>
beginning with the most significant bit for point 0. If the bit is set, the corresponding<br>
point is an off-curve point and therefore the control point for a curve. If the bit is<br>
clear, the corresponding point is an on-curve point and therefore an endpoint for<br>
either a line segment or a curve segment. Two consecutive on-curve points form a<br>
straight line.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Here's a routine that takes an index and the control bits and returns TRUE (nonzero)<br>
if the point is on the curve:
</p>
<pre> Boolean OnCurve(long *bits, long index)
{
    bits += index >> 5;     /* Skip to the appropriate long. */
    index &amp;= 31;       /* Mask to get index into current long. */
    return (*bits &amp; (0x80000000 >> index)) == 0;
}</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;Two consecutive off-curve points imply an on-curve point at their midpoint, as<br>
shown in Figure 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This path consists of two curve segments. The first is defined by<i>a,</i><br>
<i>b,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>b</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;+<i> c</i> ) / 2 and the&nbsp;&nbsp;second by (<i>b</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;+<i> c</i> ) / 2,<i>c, d. </i>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;This ability to store a series of off-curve points allows a path to describe an<br>
arbitrarily complex shape without having to store unneeded intermediate points.<br>
However, this is just a storage nicety. When we draw the path, we need it broken down<br>
into a series of line and curve segments. This is done with an iterator function called<br>
NextPathSegment. It's called continuously, each time filling a record that is either a<br>
line segment or a curve segment, until it returns FALSE.

<b>FRAMING A SHAPE MADE OF SEVERAL PATHS</b><br>
To describe a shape that contains several disjoint paths (such as an outline letter<i>o</i> ),<br>
we use a simple data structure that's just a composite of several path structures:
</p>
<pre>typedef struct{
    long    contours;
    path    contour[anyNumber];
} paths;</pre>
<p>
Drawing such a shape (called in the vernacular a<i>paths</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;) is straightforward:
</p>
<pre>typedef struct{
    long    contours;
    path    contour[anyNumber];
} paths;</pre>
<p>
Drawing such a shape (called in the vernacular a paths) is straightforward:
</p>
<pre>void FramePaths(paths *aPath)
{
    long ctr = aPath-&gt;contours;
    path *cont = aPath-&gt;contour;

    while (ctr--)
        cont = FramePath(cont);
}</pre>
<p>
The following code draws the paths shown in Figure 7. 
</p>
<pre>void ExamplePaths()
{
  long myPaths[] = {
    5,              /* Five contours. */

<h2>SAVING PATHS IN PICTS</h2>
<p>
Now that you know how to give your application the capability to draw all sorts of<br>
curved shapes on the screen or on a QuickDraw printer, you might wonder whether<br>
you can cut and paste these shapes into other applications or send them to a PostScript<br>
printer. The answer is yes, thanks to picture comments. Picture comments<br>
encapsulate non-QuickDraw graphics data that other "smarter-than- QuickDraw"<br>
applications can interpret.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/206.gif" width="390 px"></img>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 7</b> A Shape Made of Several Paths
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, there's a picture comment that takes quadratic B&#201;zier information<br>
directly: PolySmooth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this comment is encountered in a PICT it indicates that<br>
the endpoints of the following lines are control points of a quadratic B&#201;zier.<br>
Unfortunately, the comment assumes that all the control points lie off the curve. This<br>
is a major drawback of the PolySmooth comment and forces us to break a path down<br>
into curves and lines, rather than allowing us to put an entire path in at once.
</p>
<p>
When a picture interpreter (such as the LaserWriter driver) sees a PolySmooth<br>
picture comment, it interprets the following points (put in the picture with a LineTo<br>
opcode) as off-curve control points.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since DrawPicture ignores picture comments<br>
completely, the clipping rectangle is set to empty so that no drawing will occur. The<br>
picture interpreter now has the control points and can render the curve however it<br>
sees fit. 
</p>
<p>
To save a path in a picture, we start with the PolyBegin picture comment. This<br>
comment indicates that a special polygon follows. If the path is closed, we add the<br>
picPlyClo comment. Then we set the clipping to empty so that DrawPicture will not<br>
render the following data. Next we add the PolySmooth comment, followed by the<br>
control points.
</p>
<p>
When the whole polygon is in the picture, we restore the clipping to its previous state<br>
and add the PolyIgnore picture comment. Anyone reading picture comments will know<br>
to ignore the following QuickDraw polygon. DrawPicture, which ignores all picture<br>
comments and skips over the smooth polygon since the lines are all clipped out, will<br>
draw the polygon just as it should. 
</p>
<p>
Thus, we have something like the following (where an asterisk indicates a picture<br>
comment):
</p>
<p>
Save the current clip<br>
*PolyBegin<br>
Set the clip to the empty rectangle to turn off drawing<br>
*PolySmooth<br>
Record the PostScript version of the curves (just the control points)<br>
*PolyIgnore<br>
Restore the original clip to turn drawing back on<br>
Record the QuickDraw version of the curves (subdivided into short lines)<br>
*PolyEnd
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Since the PolySmooth picture comment allows only off-curve points, it's necessary to<br>
break the path down into segments. This is done by the AddPathsToPict routine, which<br>
calls AddSegmentToPict for each path fragment (either a single quadratic B&#201;zier or a<br>
line). AddSegmentToPict copies two sets of points into the PICT, one that contains the<br>
actual control points of the curve or line segment (for PostScript printing or pasting<br>
into MacDraw) and another that is the QuickDraw rendering of the curve or line.
</p>
<p>
In AddSegmentToPict (below), cur is the current segment to be added; isLine is a<br>
Boolean identifying whether the segment is a curve or a line segment; and delta<br>
specifies an amount to offset the data when recording the PostScript version, to<br>
account for the difference between PostScript's centered pen and QuickDraw's upper<br>
left pen. 
</p>

        InitPathWalker(&amp;walker, cont);
        while (NextPathSegment(&amp;walker))
            AddSegmentToPict(&amp;walker.c, &amp;penDelta, walker.isLine);
        cont = NextPath(cont);
    }
}</pre>
<p>
A word about rounding: We've kept all our data in Fixed, even during the subdivision<br>
process, up until calling LineTo; still, when we record the data into a PICT, we're<br>
forced to throw away information since the PICT records only integer coordinates. The<br>
upshot of this is that a given series of paths may draw much better in your application<br>
than when it's been put into a PICT and pasted into another application.

<h2>EXTRACTING CURVES FROM TRUETYPE</h2>
<p>
Because TrueType uses the quadratic B&#201;zier as its curve primitive, as mentioned<br>
earlier, the outlines in a TrueType font represent a rich source of curve data for<br>
programmers. In fact, a program demonstrated at Apple's Worldwide Developers<br>
Conference in May of this year uses TrueType fonts as a basis for turning text typed by<br>
the user into outlines that can be rotated, filled, stretched and shrunk, and<br>
transformed in other amusing ways. All it takes to produce such a program is to<br>
convert TrueType data from its native storage structure into a paths data structure.<br>
We show you how to do that here, and then discuss the sample program you'll find on<br>
the<i>Developer CD Series</i> disc that draws outlines extracted from TrueType fonts. 
</p>
<p>
<b>CONVERTING THE DATA</b><br>
For space reasons, the data for TrueType outlines is not stored in a paths data<br>
structure but instead is compressed as byte deltas. Code provided on this<br>
issue's<i>Developer CD Series</i> disc fills out a glyph outline data structure given a<br>
TrueType font and a glyph ID. The glyph outline data structure looks like this:
</p>
<pre>typedef struct {
    long        contourCount;
    long        pointCount;
    point       origin;
    point       advance;
    short       **endPoints;        /* [contourCount] */
    Byte        **onCurve;          /* [pointCount] */
    Fixed       **x;                /* [pointCount] */
    Fixed       **y;                /* [pointCount] */
} GlyphOutline;</pre>
<p>
A glyph outline is a bit less compact than a paths data structure, but contains enough<br>
information to be converted into one. One difference from the paths data structure is<br>
that in a path, if a control bit is set, the point is treated as an off-curve point. In a<br>
glyph outline, if the onCurve byte is set, the point is treated as an on-curve point.<br>
Another difference is that in a glyph outline, the points for all the contours are stored<br>
contiguously, rather than separated into discrete path structures.
</p>
<p>
The utility function PackControlBits takes an array of bytes, each representing a<br>
point, and packs them into a bit array, suitable for a path. It then returns a pointer to<br>
the long after the last control long. 
</p>
<pre>long *PackControlBits(long *p, Byte *onCurve, long count)
{
    unsigned long mask = 0x80000000;
   
    *p = 0;
    while (count--)
    {   if (!mask)
        {   mask = 0x80000000;
            *++p = 0;
        }
        if (!*onCurve++)
            *p |= mask;
        mask >>= 1;
    }
    return p + 1;
}</pre>
<p>
The function OutlineToPaths takes a glyph outline and returns a pointer to a path that<br>
represents the outline. NewPtr is called, so when the application has finished using the<br>
path it should call DisposePtr. 
</p>
<pre>paths *OutlineToPaths(GlyphOutline *out)
{
    long size, *p, *origP;

    /* First compute how big the resulting path will be. */
    size = sizeof(long);    /* paths.contours */

    {   long i, sp = 0;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; out-&gt;contourCount; i++)
        {   long pts = (*out-&gt;endPoints)[i] - sp + 1;
            size += sizeof(long);             /* path.vectors */
            size += (pts + 31 >> 5) << 2;
                                              /* path.controlBits */
            size += pts << 3;           /* path.vector[] */
            sp = (*out-&gt;endPoints)[i] + 1;
        }
    }

    /* Now allocate the paths. */
    origP = p = (long *)NewPtr(size);
    /* Real programs check errors. */

    /* Record the number of contours. */
    *p++ = out-&gt;contourCount;
    {   long    i, sp = 0;
        Fixed *x = *out-&gt;x;
        Fixed *y = *out-&gt;y;
        short *ep = *out-&gt;endPoints;
        Byte    *onCurve = *out-&gt;onCurve;

        /* For each contour, record the point count,
         * record the control bits, then the points. */
        for (i = 0; i &lt; out-&gt;contourCount; i++)
        {   long pts = *ep - sp + 1;
            *p++ = pts;
            p = PackControlBits(p, onCurve, pts);
            onCurve += pts;
            while (pts--)
            {   *p++ = *x++;
                *p++ = *y++;
            }
            sp = *ep++ + 1;
        }
    }
    return (paths *)origP;

<b>ABOUT OUR SAMPLE APPLICATION</b><br>
The sample application QD Curves on the<i>Developer CD Series</i> disc uses paths to draw<br>
the outlines of TrueType text. It can put the outlines onto the Clipboard so that they can<br>
be pasted into another application for editing or printing. In addition, the application<br>
uses some of the other TrueType access functions to build variable-length font and<br>
style menus and display information about a font, such as its version number,<br>
copyright notice, and trademark (see Figure 8). 
</p>
<p>
To display a path, the application determines how large the path currently is and<br>
scales it to fill the window. The utility functions OffsetPaths, ScalePaths, and<br>
GetPathsBounds are used in positioning and scaling paths.

<b>Figure 9</b> Bounds of the Control Points Versus Bounds of the Curve
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;This function to mark the control points of a path is a good framework for adding<br>
curve editing. We leave that to you also, and suggest that besides simple<br>
point-by-point direct mouse editing, you consider providing the capability to do the<br>
following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>do direct curve editing by hit-testing the curve itself instead of just its<br>
control points</li>
<li>select groups of points/segments to move at once, similar to selecting<br>
multiple icons in the Finder</li>
<li>do constrain-based editing, where tangent continuity is maintained<br>
between adjacent segments</li>
<li>interpolate changes to a set of key points across the rest of the path,<br>
allowing, for instance, creation of a bold character by simply moving a few<br>
points on the stems and then smoothing out the rest of the outlines</li>
</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;NOW IT'S UP TO YOU</h2>
<p>
This article has given you the tools to do some fancy work with curves in your<br>
applications. We've given you routines for drawing curves and paths using QuickDraw,<br>
discussed how to save these in PICTs so that they can be loaded into other programs like<br>
MacDraw or printed using the LaserWriter, and shown how to extract paths from<br>
TrueType fonts, giving you an abundant supply of path data. Now it's up to you to play<br>
off this knowledge by adding curve editing, text rotation, and other means of<br>
transforming your new freehand curves. 
</p>
<h2>PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS, ANYONE?</h2>
<p>
Though you can draw curves without understanding the mathematics behind the<br>
operation, some people find this kind of thing interesting. This explanation is for those<br>
people (you know who you are).
</p>
<p>
A quadratic B&#201;zier (or parabola) can be defined by the parametric equation
</p>
<p>
<i>f</i> (<i>t</i> ) = <i>a</i> (1 - <i>t</i> )2 + 2<i>bt</i> (1 - <i>t</i> ) + <i>ct</i> 2
</p>
<p>
where <i>t</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;is a scalar and <i>a, b, </i> and <i>c</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;are points.
</p>
<p>
This parametric formulation has the advantage of being rotationally independent: since<br>
<i>t</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;is the independent variable, and not <i>x</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;or <i>y</i> , there is no bias for curves that are<br>
symmetric about the x- or y-axis. Thus, to rotate the curve, you only need to rotate <i>a,</i><br>
<i>b, </i> and <i>c</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;into their new positions, while the equation for the curve stays the same.
</p>
<p>
To better understand the equation, take a look at its geometric representation in Figure<br>
3. You'll note there that as the curve is drawn from point <i> a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;to point <i>c</i> , <i>t</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;varies from<br>
0 to 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The curve at <i> a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;is tangential to the line<i>ab,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;and the curve at <i>c</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;tangential to<br>
the line <i> bc.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Its maximum displacement from the line that could be drawn from <i>a </i> to <i>c</i> <br>
is reached at point <i>q</i> , where <i>t</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;is 0.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the curve at <i> q</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;is parallel to the<br>
(imagined) line <i>ac</i> .
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most useful property of the curve in this form is the easy way it can be<br>
decomposed into a pair of smaller curves, each of the same form. This is called <br>
<i>subdivision</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;and is the basis for drawing curves in QuickDraw.
</p>
<p>
Suppose we subdivide the curve at point <i>q</i> , as shown in Figure 4. The point <i> q </i> is
</p>
<p>
<i>q</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;= <i>f</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;( 0.5) = (<i>a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 2<i>b</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;+ <i>c</i> ) / 4
</p>
<p>
The tangent (that is, the first derivative) of the curve at <i> q</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;is parallel to the line <i> ac.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>f'</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>t</i> ) = -2<i>a</i> (1 - <i>t</i> ) + 2<i>b</i> (1 - 2<i>t</i> ) + 2<i>ct</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>f'</i> (0.5) = <i>c</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>a</i>
</p>
<p>
The line from the point <i>b' </i> = (<i>a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;+ <i>b</i> ) / 2 to <i>q</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;is tangential to the curve at <i> q</i> .
</p>
<p>
<i>q</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>b' </i> =
</p>
<p>
(<i>a </i> + 2<i>b </i> + <i>c</i> ) / 4 - (<i>a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;+ <i>b</i> ) / 2 =
</p>
<p>
(<i>a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 2<i>b</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;+ <i>c</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;- 2<i>a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;- 2<i>b</i> ) / 4 =
</p>
<p>
(<i>c</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>a</i> ) / 4
</p>
<p>
By symmetry, the same holds for <i> b''</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;= (<i>b</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;+ <i>c</i> ) / 2.
</p>
<p>
Thus, the formulas for the two curves that make up the left and right halves of the<br>
original curve are as follows:
</p>
<p>
Left:<i> a'</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;= <i>a</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;b'</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;= (<i>a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;+ <i>b</i> ) / 2
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;c'</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;= (<i>a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 2<i>b</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;+ <i>c</i> ) / 4
</p>
<p>
Right:<i> a'' </i> = (<i>a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 2<i>b</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;+ <i>c</i> ) / 4
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;b'' </i> = (<i>b </i> + <i>c</i> ) / 2
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;c'' </i> = <i>c</i> The equations for the new points are especially nice, since the arithmetic can<br>
be performed with only shifts and adds, making it very efficient.
</p>
<p>
Notice in Figure 4 that each of the resulting smaller curves is flatter than the original<br>
curve, by a factor of 4. This means that the distance from the midpoint of the curve to<br>
the midpoint of the straight line drawn from the start point to the endpoint is reduced<br>
by 4. Thus, if the curve is subdivided enough times, drawing the curve will be<br>
equivalent to drawing a line from the start point to the endpoint for each of the little<br>
curves. This is the basis for drawing the curve in QuickDraw.
