<h2>LETTERS</h2>
Thanks for the excellent article in the October 1990 issue of develop dealing with<br>
polymorphism in C++ stand-alone code resources. I have one question about the code<br>
that accompanied it&nbsp;&nbsp;on the disc; it concerns the file WindowDef_main.cp: why are the<br>
overloaded "new" and "delete"&nbsp;&nbsp;operator definitions bracketed by&nbsp;&nbsp;the #ifdef NEEDED<br>
and #endif statements? Is NEEDED defined somewhere else? (I couldn't find it in any<br>
of the other files on the CD.) Are there circumstances in which you wouldn't want to<br>
overload the storage operators for a window definition function? I'm confused.<br>
--Carlos Weber, M.D.<br>
<p>
<i>Yahoo, a technical buck to stop! Lemme at it!</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The code in question (#ifdef NEEDED... #endif) shouldn't be there at all, and as a</i><br>
<i>matter of fact is ignored by the compiler, since NEEDED isn't defined. It is left over</i><br>
<i>from when Patrick was developing the code and still experimenting.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>In the final version he is basing his WindowDefinition class on the&nbsp;&nbsp;Relocatable class,</i><br>
<i>which is in turn based on HandleObject, an Apple&#174; extension to C++ which uses</i><br>
<i>handles instead of pointers when allocating space for new objects. No overloading of the</i><br>
<i>storage operators is necessary.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sorry about the confusion. I should have spotted that code and yanked it out before we</i><br>
<i>published.</i><br>

In develop, Issue 4, you advocate installing DRVR resources at startup time by<br>
changing their resource ID to an empty slot in the Unit Table and then calling<br>
OpenDriver rather than use _DrvrInstall due to its bug.
</p>
<p>
The problem with this method is&nbsp;&nbsp;that it actually modifies the DRVR&nbsp;&nbsp;resource, which<br>
has two consequences:&nbsp;&nbsp;1. According to Apple you are not supposed to modify yourself;<br>
and 2. it sets the last date modified field on the file. This latter problem causes backup<br>
programs to think the file has really changed and it worries users that perhaps some<br>
virus has modified that&nbsp;&nbsp;file when they know they didn't.
</p>
<p>
Thus, in my opinion, it is much better&nbsp;&nbsp;to use _DrvrInstall and, until Apple fixes the<br>
bug, stuff the DCE yourself. This method does not suffer the side effects of the<br>
OpenDriver method.<br>
--Jeff Shulman
</p>
<p>
<i>You're right, it's easier to use the method outlined in my article, but it's "better"to </i><br>
<i>use _DrvrInstall and manually put the pointer to the driver into the appropriate field</i><br>
<i>in the DCE.</i><br>

I have a question about the article on&nbsp;&nbsp;the 8*24 GC card in&nbsp;&nbsp;develop, Issue 3, which,<br>
incidentally, was excellent. On pages 338 and 339 you mention the files that must be<br>
present to use the card. Is the GC file a transparent patching upgrade or is it a<br>
supplemental code block that duplicates all of the 32-Bit QD file functionality?
</p>
<p>
Good luck with Dogcow breeding,<br>
--David
</p>
<p>
<i>The 8*24 GC file contains more (and less) than just the 29000 equivalent of 32-Bit</i><br>
<i>QuickDraw TM; it also contains the IPC software that steals QD calls and transfers</i><br>
<i>them to the card, the shell (GC OS) that receives the commands and dispatches them as</i><br>
<i>well as doing the Memory Management chores and such, and finally the 'drawing' parts</i><br>
<i>of 32 QD. Note that calls that do not cause any drawing to take place, such as</i><br>
<i>NewGWorld, are not part of GC QD but are executed by the main processor even when</i><br>
<i>acceleration is on.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>All these functions are not part of 32 QD and therefore make it necessary to have the</i><br>
<i>8*24 GC file present when you want to have acceleration. So when running 6.0.x you</i><br>
<i>need both files, 32 QuickDraw and 8*24 GC; under 7.0 you will need to have the 8*24</i><br>
<i>GC file present.</i><br>

Have you guys considered adding perfume to the CD envelope, to try to raise a little<br>
capital from advertising to offset your costs? "C perfume, for the programmer in<br>
every man," "L'Air du Comp, as fresh as a new CPU."<br>

My copy of develop arrived in my P.O. box this morning and therein lies the problem.<br>
In its original shape develop will not fit into my P.O. box so its shape was altered to<br>
make it fit. The CD is warped, and try as it might, the Finder TM cannot make the<br>
"minor repairs" it says are needed. Unfortunately, we out here on the frontier don't<br>
have someone to bring our mail to us each day; we have to go fetch it--and pay for the<br>
privilege. So I'm stuck with the U.S. Postal Service and an unusable CD.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a large "DO NOT BEND"&nbsp;&nbsp;on the outside of subsequent issues&nbsp;&nbsp;will avert<br>
deformation. Then again, maybe not. Would you kindly use&nbsp;&nbsp;your considerable influence<br>
to get&nbsp;&nbsp;me a flat CD?
</p>
<p>
And if the printed warning doesn't work, how about a steel plate in each issue? Make<br>
that a really stiff steel plate. You know how those Postal Service people are--neither<br>
rain nor snow nor CD. . .<br>
--Warren Michelsen
</p>
<p>
<i>Sorry about that mangled CD--pushing the limits on information distribution</i><br>
<i>sometimes we run into hassles like how to actually get the information into the hands</i><br>
<i>(and drives) of the folks that need it. Hopefully our "DO NOT BEND" notice will help</i><br>
<i>because I'd sure hate to have to resort to a steel plate.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>f in fact, the warning doesn't help, you&nbsp;&nbsp;can contact the fulfillment house (see the</i><br>
<i>subscription order form at the back of the issue for contact information) and tell them</i><br>
<i>that your CD was mauled; they'll&nbsp;&nbsp;be happy to send you a new copy.</i><br>

In response to recent concern regarding the ecological soundness of your page layout, I<br>
have the following comments:
</p>
<p>
CD-ROM and electronic magazines are examples of technologies that--provided they<br>
are adopted-- are ecologically superior to more traditional media,&nbsp;&nbsp;such as paper.
</p>
<p>
develop is encouraging the adoption of these new media, and thus can easily defend its<br>
spacious page layout. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the few publications that&nbsp;&nbsp;can have a positive<br>
environmental impact--provided that developers absorb and act upon its contents.
</p>
<p>
Incorporating these new technologies into useful products is the first step toward their<br>
eventual widespread adoption. By keepingdevelopeasy-to-read, you are encouraging<br>
this trend. 
</p>
<p>
P.S. Providing an e-mail address&nbsp;&nbsp;for comments would also decrease&nbsp;&nbsp;paper usage!<br>
--Bryn Dyment

<i>Thanks for your words of encouragement. Pushing CD distribution is one way we're</i><br>
<i>trying to get away from killing forests; using recycled paper is another. Our</i><br>
<i>production manager, Hartley Lesser, found a paper that meets our quality standards,</i><br>
<i>that doesn't use toxic chemicals for de-inking, and that's available in the quantities we</i><br>
<i>require. This issue is the first one printed on the new paper--let us know what you</i><br>
<i>think.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Also, we are now even more available electronically (although Dave's much more</i><br>
<i>connected than I am), so if you'd rather send e-mail, feel free to use the addresses&nbsp;&nbsp;we</i><br>
<i>provide.</i><br>

May it be known by you and your wonderfully talented crew how very much I<br>
appreciate your efforts on behalf of creating the wonderful, informative, interesting,<br>
entertaining, and otherwise "slick" magazine, develop. The opportunity to see what<br>
others are doing, who those others are, and perhaps to learn more than you would from<br>
<i>MacWeek</i> , but less than from <i>Inside Macintosh,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;is indeed welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;Add to this the fact<br>
that you include a CD-ROM and I am hard-pressed to even IMAGINE a more valuable<br>
offering. Great job. Thanks a zillion!!<br>

I noticed that Apple is looking for a&nbsp;&nbsp;new editor-in-chief for the major publications.<br>
You're not going anywhere, are you?<br>

<i>First of all, believe it or not, I did&nbsp;&nbsp;not make up this letter (or even the signature).</i><br>
<i>Our group (Developer&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical Communications) recently reorganized and now my</i><br>
<i>grouplet is responsible for not only develop, but also technical updates (like the Q &amp; A</i><br>
<i>stack), Technical Notes, Sample Code, and reporting compatibility bugs to developers.</i><br>
<i>Since I need to spend my time doing the things that managers do, I'm looking for</i><br>
<i>someone to do all the real work. If this sounds fun and you think you'd be&nbsp;&nbsp;qualified, let</i><br>
<i>me know.</i><br>
