<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>
<h1>CAROLINE ROSE</h1>

</p>
<p>
Dear Readers, My editorial in Issue 6 ended with this riddle: "I entered this entire<br>
editorial without pressing a single key on the keyboard or clicking the mouse button. I<br>
was as quiet as a mouse (the furry kind). How did I do this? And furthermore, why?"<br>
Well, first I had an on-screen keyboard (a desk accessory) that interprets a click on<br>
one of its keys as a press of that key. This DA has an option that lets you set a delay<br>
after which the mere presence of the cursor over that key will be interpreted as a<br>
keypress. I also had a trackball set up on the floor and used my foot to move the cursor<br>
around. So with this I was able to type without using my hands.
</p>
<p>
As for why I wasn't using my hands--besides as a way of getting a snappy ending to the<br>
editorial-- I'm one of many people who suffer from RSI, repetitive strain injury. In<br>
my case, this means tendinitis in my forearms, but it can also mean carpal tunnel<br>
syndrome and a host of other similar problems. Since my recent return to Apple &#174;,<br>
I've learned that there are many software and hardware products for the Macintosh&#174;<br>
that can help RSI sufferers and others with limited hand movement. I'm now using a<br>
trackball with my nondominant (less-suffering) hand and with a foot switch--a pedal<br>
I step on to click. I'm also using a desk accessory that alerts me when I've been typing<br>
for a half hour without at least a five-minute break (I chose delicate Tibetan-style<br>
flute music as my auditory cue, but there are of course less sublime options). There<br>
are many similar products that I haven't yet explored. With diligent stretching and<br>
breaks from typing--and freedom from using the mouse--I'm able to type as much as<br>
I need to in order to do my job. Many others are less fortunate.
</p>
<p>
That's the good news. The bad news is that many of these products don't work with<br>
other, mainstream software: the on-screen keyboard isn't compatible with a certain<br>
macro program I'd also benefit from using, or with the word processor I use most of<br>
the time. This is a very real example of the effect of programming things in<br>
nonstandard ways--for example, using GetKeys to find out what characters have been<br>
typed rather than getting this information out of the event record, or calling the ADB<br>
Manager when you're not writing a special driver and so really should be using<br>
higher-level routines. (You know who you are.)
</p>
<p>
Incompatibilities notwithstanding, these products are terrific, and thanks go to all the<br>
Macintosh developers who have created them. You've made a big difference in some<br>
people's lives--probably including your own, since I've learned that the motivation<br>
for many of you has been that you've had a repetitive strain injury yourselves. For<br>
those of you who haven't yet had the problem, you'd be wise to takes steps toward<br>
prevention. Don't ignore it; if you slave over the keyboard for long hours, it will<br>
probably not ignore you.

While we're on the subject of doing the right thing, I might add that <i> develop</i> 's paper is<br>
now recycled enough to pass California's stringent requirements for the use of the<br>
familiar recycle logo (which we now proudly bear on our back cover). Formerly we<br>
used paper that was 50 percent de-inked (waste paper from printing plants, with the<br>
chemical inks removed); now our paper is also 10 percent post- consumer waste (not<br>
de-inked). Recycled paper keeps getting better looking and more practical to use;<br>
we're happy to be able to do our part toward saving the forests. Please do yours, and<br>
recycle your issues of <i>develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;if you don't want to hold on to them--preferably by<br>
passing them on to a friend! As always, we welcome your comments and suggestions.<br>
Keep those cards and letters coming . . .

<b>&nbsp;Caroline Rose Editor</b>

<b>CAROLINE ROSE </b>has been writing computer documentation ever since "timesharing"<br>
meant mainframes, not condos. After a seven-year digression into programming, she<br>
returned to writing and joined Apple to document the inner workings of a beguiling<br>
new computer named Macintosh. The result was a three-volume tome that was<br>
affectionately nicknamed "The Vault of Horror." In what proved to be another<br>
digression, she left Apple to launch NeXT's documentation effort (starting,<br>
interestingly enough, with writing the WriteNowTM For Macintosh manual). She's<br>
thrilled to be back at Apple with all its charms. Caroline is an avid reader, swimmer,<br>
dancer, and hiker, and is passionate about her cat and all things Italian. Seeing Michael<br>
Crawford in <i>Phantom of the Opera</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;was a recent high that she's not sure how she'll top<br>
(but she'll try).<b> *</b>
