<h2>APPLE II Q &amp; A</h2>
<h1>APPLE II DEVELOPER TECHNICAL SUPPORT</h1>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> How can I "dim" text in my Apple II GS application, similar to the way the Toolbox</i><br>
<i>dims menu titles and menu options, and the way that HiliteControl dims a button name?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Dimming text is a piece of cake. Here's how the Apple II GS Menu Manager does it in<br>
both 640 and 320 mode. The same thing works great for both.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the bounding box of the text.</li>
<li>Fill it with the proper background color for the operation in question.</li>
<li>Draw the text.</li>
<li>Execute code that looks something like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre>    pea dimmed>>16
    pea dimmed
    _SetPenMask         ;Set the pen mask to "dimmed" mask
    pea textRect>>16
    pea textRect        ;Push pointer to text boundary rect
    lda backColor       ;Get text's background color
    and #$00FF          ;Always solid

; Here you need to do something in your code to get the
; appropriate pattern for the text you're drawing. This will be
; one of the 16 patterns in the 512-byte table, starting with 16
; bytes of $00, 16 bytes of $11, and ending with 16 bytes of $FF.
; We leave the routine GetColorPtr for you to code, but our
; example assumes it returns the pointer we need in A (low word)
; and X (high word).

    jsr GetColorPtr         ;(see above)
    phx                     ;high word
    pha                     ;low word
    _FillRect               ;Fill will be dithered
    pea nor_mask>>16  ;Reset drawing mask to normal solid
    pea nor_mask
    _SetPenMask
    rts

textRect    DC.B $00,00,00,00   ;Put your rectangle here
backColor   DC.W $0000          ;Background color of text to dim

dimmed      DC.B $55,$AA,$55,$AA,$55,$AA,$55,$AA
nor_mask    DC.B $FF,$FF,$FF,$FF,$FF,$FF,$FF,$FF</pre>

&nbsp;Yes, it's really this easy!

<b>Q</b><i> When I call FixFontMenu from my Apple II GS new desk accessory (NDA),</i><br>
<i>everything works fine, but if the current application has a font menu it stops working.</i><br>
<i>What's wrong?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> FixFontMenu keeps only one correspondence between menu item IDs and font family<br>
numbers--if you call FixFontMenu from an NDA, you blow away the already existing<br>
correspondence that the application was using, maintained within the Font Manager.<br>
ItemID2FamNum then works only on item IDs corresponding to your NDA's font menu,<br>
and these usually are unrelated to the values the application passes from its font menu.<br>
Worse, FamNum2ItemID will subsequently return menu item IDs for font family<br>
numbers that have nothing to do with the application's menus; depending on how the<br>
application operates on the resulting item ID, this could be disastrous.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Fortunately, doing this yourself is fairly easy with the Font Manager's help.<br>
CountFamilies tells you how many font families there are, and FindFamily returns the<br>
name of each of them. You can manipulate this information into a font menu in a fairly<br>
straightforward way, using standard Menu Manager calls. While you're at it, you can<br>
also use FindFontStats to figure out what point sizes and styles are available for each<br>
font family, so you can indicate this in your Size and Style menus. You could even use<br>
the information to build your own font-choosing dialog, much as HyperCard IIGS does.<br>
Remember that your NDA should run in either 320 or 640 mode, so don't make the<br>
dialog box too wide.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> When using an Apple II GS run queue item, can I use the second reserved field to find</i><br>
<i>out when the item was last executed? I assume this value is the tickCount. Currently, I</i><br>
<i>just get the current tickCount and subtract the last tickCount. Using this field could</i><br>
<i>save me one tool call, and when doing animation via a RunQ, every extra tick counts.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> No, you should not use undocumented fields in the run queue header because they<br>
could change with future software releases. However, there is a fast way to get the<br>
current tick count. Pass refNum $0005 to the GetAddr function in the Miscellaneous<br>
Tools once each time your program runs, and it tells you the location of the tick<br>
counter. Since the tick count changes during heartbeat interrupts, be sure to disable<br>
interrupts around your direct accesses to the tick counter (PHP, SEI, access tick<br>
count, PLP).
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;If your application makes certain tool calls frequently, it may be worthwhile to<br>
short-circuit the tool dispatcher and transfer control to the Toolbox function directly<br>
(if the tool takes a long time to execute anyway, it isn't worth it). You can get a<br>
function's address and work area pointer by calling GetFuncPtr and GetWAP in the Tool<br>
Locator. When the function gets control, the Y and A registers must contain the tool<br>
set's work area pointer, the X register must contain the function number, and there<br>
must be <i> two</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;RTL addresses on the stack.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Does the Apple IIe Card for the Macintosh LC have a technical reference manual?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> There's no separate technical reference manual. Use the <i> Apple IIe Technical</i><br>
<i>Reference</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Addison- Wesley), together with Apple IIe Technical Note #10, "The<br>
Apple IIe Card for the Macintosh LC."
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> What's the proper method of saving the Apple II GS Super Hi-Res (SHR) screens? If</i><br>
<i>my application both uses shadowing and is fast-port aware, the restored screen colors</i><br>
<i>are garbaged. Can I simply use HandToPtr with ptr representing the screen addresses,</i><br>
<i>or will this mess up the scan-line control byte (SCB) restoration since these are</i><br>
<i>read-modify-write locations?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> The shadowed screen's SCBs may not be correct, so by saving and restoring them<br>
you're causing random data to be restored into the standard SCBs. Your best bet, if<br>
shadowing is on, is to turn shadowing off, restore the bank $01 screen, including its<br>
SCBs and color tables, turn shadowing on, and restore the $E1 screen and contents. If<br>
you don't want to double-restore the $E1 screen and $01 screen, you should turn<br>
shadowing off, restore the bank $01 color tables/SCBs, turn shadowing on, and<br>
restore the $01 screen. But, since these screens are never guaranteed to be the same<br>
when you save, you should always restore both screens separately.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;QuickDraw never touches the shadowed screen SCBs, so if the fastPort flag is set you<br>
can ignore the restoring of the bank $01 SCBs/color tables, since the application<br>
promised not to&nbsp;&nbsp;interfere with them. But since this won't save very much time, you<br>
probably shouldn't worry about it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I am using an Apple II GS utility to generate resources for my application, and I</i><br>
<i>noticed that some of the resource IDs generated are in the range $07FF0000 to</i><br>
<i>$07FFFFFF, which is reserved for the system software's use. What's happening?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Your utility is calling UniqueResourceID with an IDRange of $FFFF, to request any<br>
unused resource ID. A bug in system software version 5.0.x allows UniqueResourceID<br>
to accidentally return a system-range resource ID <i>if</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;any system-range resources of<br>
that type are already present. This will be fixed in System 6. In the meantime,<br>
utilities can use UniqueResourceID with IDRange values other than $FFFF, and you<br>
should watch your resource IDs carefully to avoid using system-range resource IDs.
