<h2>MACINTOSH Q &amp; A</h2>
<h1>MACINTOSH DEVELOPER TECHNICAL SUPPORT</h1>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>How can I set the Protect bit&nbsp;&nbsp;of a file?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>The Protect bit is neither documented nor supported. PBSetCatInfo and PBSetFInfo<br>
cannot set this bit. Additionally, attempting to change the Lock bit also fails with either<br>
of these calls. SetFLock trap must be used to set the Lock bit of the file's attribute. The<br>
Protect bit was an early method of copy protection. If the Finder sees this bit set, it<br>
will not allow the user to copy, move, delete, or rename the file. It is important to note<br>
that&nbsp;&nbsp;ONLY the Finder pays any attention to this bit. So, it would be possible to use any<br>
file utility to copy the file even if it is "protected".
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>System 6's "About Finder" memory info for my 16 MB Macintosh IIfx is incorrect.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>System 6 does not run in 32-bit address mode so it cannot support more than 8 MB<br>
of RAM. What you are seeing in the "About" box is the Finder trying to understand what<br>
has happened to the other 8 MB of RAM. It assumes the system is using it, but in<br>
reality the RAM is not being used by anything. A/UX and System 7 both support up to 1<br>
GB of RAM for 68030 Macintoshes since the IIci. System 7's "Memory" cdev must be<br>
set for 32-bit addressing in order to take advantage of RAM beyond 8 MB.&nbsp;&nbsp;This also<br>
requires "32-bit clean" ROMs (Macintosh IIci or later). 
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Is there a way to determine if a machine has a PMMU installed? </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>The Gestault Manager's gestaultMMUType selector (available since System 6.0.4)<br>
will tell you if, and which type of, MMU is installed. For preliminary Gestault<br>
documentation and interface files, check AppleLink and developer CDs.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>How do I set the cursor at interrupt time, for instance in a VBL task? </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Changing the cursor at interrupt time is permissible as long as the cursor handle is<br>
locked in memory and the cursor routines are not busy. A test needs to be performed<br>
before you change the cursor. If you want to call SetCursor (with a cursor handle<br>
locked in memory), you nmust check CrsrBusy, a low-global defined in the Macintosh<br>
Programmer's Workshop (MPW) SysEqu. If CrsrBusy is true, then you cannot call<br>
SetCursor. Changing the cursor while CrsrBusy is true causes it to leave mouse bits,<br>
or trails, on the screen.
</p>
<pre>CrsrBusy    EQU     $8CD    ; Cursor locked out? [byte]</pre>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>How do penguins know when&nbsp;&nbsp;it&#8217;s safe to go in the water?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Penguins in the Antarctic face many perils, not the least of which are several species<br>
of sea mammals waiting at the edge of icebergs to nibble on their little penguin bods<br>
when they go in the water. So, penguins will just wander around on the edge of an ice<br>
floe until one of them accidentally falls in the ocean. When that happens all the<br>
penguins will stand by and watch to see if the fallen penguin gets eaten. If the penguin<br>
comes to harm it&#8217;s back to&nbsp;&nbsp;business as usual on the iceberg. If the penguin is safe<br>
(apparently for a period of time known only to the other penguins) then the entire<br>
dissimulation leaps in, hunting for food.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Is the maximum size of a resource still 32K?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>No. There used to be a bug in the 64K ROMs that didn&#8217;t allow you to write even<br>
multiples of 32K (that is, 32K-64K, 128K-192K). This was fixed in 128K ROMs. As<br>
of 128K ROMs, the resource size is limited to &#8220;maxlongint&#8221; bytes.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>How do I write a background-only application for MultiFinder?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>A background-only application is similar to a standard MultiFinder-aware<br>
application except that it performs a task in the background with no user interface<br>
such as windows or menus.&nbsp;&nbsp;A background-only application must not initialize any<br>
Toolbox managers; for example, it must not call InitWindows or InitMenus. If a dialog<br>
needs to be displayed by a background application, the Notification Manager should be<br>
used. 
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>I am writing a Chooser PACK resource. When I change the flags that control which</i><br>
<i>messages I will be sent, nothing seems to change. Why?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Chooser caches the flags from your Chooser PACK the first time it sees the file. From<br>
then on, changes are ignored until the PACK's name is changed, or until the Chooser's<br>
cache is flushed. To flush the cache, simply hold down the Command and Option keys<br>
when selecting Chooser from the Apple menu. When the cache is flushed, the system<br>
will beep.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>What can I do and not do while executing in interrupt code?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Interrupt code is most commonly used for I/O completion routines, VBLs, Time<br>
Manager tasks, and deferred tasks. Contrary to popular belief, the Deferred Task<br>
Manager will run your task at interrupt level. All code that runs at interrupt level<br>
must follow very strict rules. The most important rule is that the code cannot allocate,<br>
move, or purge memory, reference memory manager structures (that is, HUnlock),<br>
or call a Toolbox routine that would. This eliminates nearly, if not all, QuickDraw<br>
operations. For a more complete list of these Toolbox routines, refer to the <i> Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh X-Ref</i> .
</p>
<p>
Additionally, interrupt code should&nbsp;&nbsp;avoid accessing a low-memory global&nbsp;&nbsp;or calling a<br>
trap that would access one. While MultiFinder is running, the applications'<br>
low-memory globals are being swapped in and out. Because of this, the interrupt code<br>
cannot rely on which application's globals are currently available. Even if<code> CurApName</code><br>
is correct, the interrupt routine may be called while MultiFinder is in the process of<br>
swapping the applications' globals. This restriction is difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;to deal with because<br>
there is no documention as to which low-memory globals are swapped by MultiFinder,<br>
nor which globals are accessed by traps.
</p>
<p>
A typical example of this problem is interrupt routines that attempt to restore A5 by<br>
examining CurrentA5. This low-memory global is valid only while the current<br>
application is running at non-interrupt time. Thus, the Macintosh Programmer's<br>
Workshop (MPW) routine<code> SetCurrentA5 </code>(or the obsolete<code>SetupA5</code>) cannot be used at<br>
interrupt level. It is necessary to place the application's A5 value somewhere it can be<br>
located while in the interrupt routine. This is documented in Technical Notes #180<br>
and #208. In fact, the exact code you need is in #180.
</p>
<p>
Also, there are interrupt limitations while System 7 is running under Virtual<br>
Memory. Therefore, it is best to avoid interrupt code if at all possible. Move the<br>
functionality of the interrupt code into the application. For example, if you do require<br>
a VBL, limit the code to an absolute minimum. Also, set a global flag for the application<br>
to check in its event loop.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Is the maximum size for global and local data still 32K?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Starting with MPW 3.0, the maximum size for global data in MPW became larger<br>
than 32K, using compiler and linker options -m and -srt. Local data is tougher,<br>
because local data is allocated by using the LINK instruction, for example, LINK<br>
A6,#$-380. With this relative addressing mode, you're constrained to the negative<br>
side of a&nbsp;&nbsp;16-bit value for local space, which translates to 32K. That is, this limit is<br>
basically due to the Motorola processor architecture. If you are allocating more than<br>
32K either globally or locally, you might want to rearchitect your system to use<br>
dynamic (and theoretically unbounded, especially on virtual architectures) storage<br>
space. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Is it possible to get PAL (Phased Alternate Lines) timing from the new 4*8 and 8*24</i><br>
<i>cards?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>The 4*8 and 8*24 cards currently support NTSC (National Television Standards<br>
Committee) output and will support PAL output as well when the next ROM revision is<br>
put into production early this year. (The 8*24 GC card currently supports PAL.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>What is a System Error 29? It's not in any of the documentation I have available. One</i><br>
<i>of my applications has been reported to crash with this error occasionally.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>When the Package Manager can't load in a PACK resource for any reason, it calls<br>
SysErr. There is a range of system error codes reserved for the situation in which the<br>
PACK resource couldn't be loaded. That range is 17 through 24. So if it couldn't load<br>
the List Manager package, which is PACK 0, the Package Manager adds 0 to 17 and calls<br>
SysErr with a code of 17. If it couldn't load the Standard File package, which is PACK<br>
3, the Package Manager adds 3 to 17 and calls SysErr with a code of 20.
</p>
<p>
The problem is, we overflowed our PACK SysErr range. The Color Picker is PACK 12.<br>
If the Package Manager couldn't load in PACK 12, it adds 12 to 17 and calls SysErr<br>
with a code of ... 29. And there you have it.
</p>
<p>
PACKs are loaded into the system heap. If there's not enough room in the system heap<br>
for a PACK, the system heap is expanded and the PACK is loaded in. If you set your<br>
application to take over the entire application memory space, the system heap can't<br>
grow anymore. The GetResource('PACK',12) call that the Package Manager makes<br>
fails: It adds 12 to 17, and calls SysErr with a code of 29. This could be what's causing<br>
the crashes in your case.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>How can we increase the stack space allocated by the DA Handler?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>There is no simple, supported way&nbsp;&nbsp;to increase the stack space available&nbsp;&nbsp;to a DA. DAs<br>
were designed to&nbsp;&nbsp;provide easy access to simple tools from the user's desktop. As such,<br>
the environment of a DA is relatively limited. Now, with MultiFinder and especially<br>
with System 7.0, applications can provide all the functionality of a DA with none of the<br>
limitations. Under MultiFinder the DA Handler actually reduces the stack space<br>
available to a DA by about 25 percent. This limitation is not a problem for<br>
applications. If you need stack space beyond the bounds of the DA's environment, we<br>
encourage you to convert your DA to a full application.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Does 32-Bit QuickDraw support packed PICTs? What's the technique for saving</i><br>
<i>packed PICT formats? What compression schemes are supported?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Color QuickDraw has always supported packed PICTs. See <i> Inside Macintosh</i> , volume<br>
V, for details on how CLUT PixMaps are packed. Under 32-Bit QuickDraw, to pack<br>
direct RGB PixMaps in PICTs, call CopyBits with the packType field in the source<br>
PixMap set to one of the following constants that apply to direct RGB PixMaps:
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p><table border="0"><tr><td>0</td><td>default packing (pixelSize 16 defaults to packType 3 and pixelSize 32 defaults to</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>packType 4)</td></tr></table></p>
<p><table border="0"><tr><td>1</td><td>no packing</td></tr></table></p>
<p><table border="0"><tr><td>2</td><td>remove pad byte (32-bit pixels only)</td></tr></table></p>
<p><table border="0"><tr><td>3</td><td>run-length encoding by pixel size chunks (16-bit pixels only)</td></tr></table></p>
<p><table border="0"><tr><td>4</td><td>run-length encoding, all of one component at the time, one scan line at a time</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>(24-bit pixels only)</td></tr></table></p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Scheme 4 will store the alpha channel also if cmpCount is set to to four. PackSize is<br>
not used and should be set to zero for compatibility reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;See Inside Macintosh,<br>
Volume 6, for complete details.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Is there any way to stop the Dialog Manager from playing with the</i><code> txSize</code><br>
<i>and</i><code>txFace </code><i>fields of a dialog's</i><code> grafPort </code><i>so that I can draw Geneva 9-point text from</i><br>
<i>within a userItem proc?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Unfortunately, because the Dialog Manager forgets about your previous calls to<br>
TextFont and TextSize when you put up your dialog again, you will need to call TextFont<br>
and TextSize every time your userItem proc is called.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>When should the Color Manager be used and when should the Palette Manager be used?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>The Palette Manager is by far the friendlier and more versatile of the two. It<br>
provides all the functionality you need to customize and animate the colors in your<br>
application. You shouldn't ever need to use the Color Manager unless you require<br>
custom color search and complement functions. Unless you really understand the Color<br>
Manager in detail, you are likely to have problems getting the Color Manager to work<br>
in a clean fashion.
</p>
<p>
When using the Palette Manager, applications following the rules will maintain their<br>
respective color environments safely as windows move back and forth from foreground<br>
to background, and from one screen to another. Accomplishing this with the Color<br>
Manager calls is not worth the effort. For additional information, see the Palette<br>
Manager article in this issue.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>I would like to make my fills print better. Currently, they come out as 72 dpi</i><br>
<i>patterns. Is there a way that&nbsp;&nbsp;I can make them print at a higher resolution, but have</i><br>
<i>my patterns still print as patterns?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>To make your patterns print at the printer's resolution, you need to use Printing<br>
Manager PrGeneral's<code> GetRslData </code>and<code> SetRsl </code>opcodes to get and set the resolution,<br>
and you must scale the pattern to match. Let&nbsp;&nbsp;me explain.
</p>
<p>
If we do not scale our patterns up to the printer's resolution before print time, we<br>
would get "big chunky" patterns because the printer driver would need to scale the<br>
patterns on the fly from 72 dpi to its resolution. Therefore, we use the "cookie cutter"<br>
approach to "place" the pattern into the object that is being filled. The size of the<br>
"cookie cutter" (the destination Rect) depends on the "scaleFactor." For example, a<br>
"scaleFactor" of 2 will have a destination rect of 16 x 16. We will then CopyBits the<br>
pattern one square at a time into the object that is being filled.
</p>
<p>
You might find the article "Meet PrGeneral" from the July 1990 issue&nbsp;&nbsp;of develop<br>
useful for describing the functionality of PrGeneral in greater detail.

<p>
<b>Q</b><i>What versions of Apple Color Printer software work with what system software</i><br>
<i>versions? Can Apple Color Printer software distributed with System 6.0.7 work with</i><br>
<i>System 6.0.5 and earlier versions? I am distributing LaserWriter &#174; drivers with</i><br>
<i>modified pgsz resources. I would like to cut back on the number of files I need to</i><br>
<i>distribute.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>The software sent with version 6.0.7 will work with all other 6.0.x systems. This<br>
should be the rule with most other LaserWriter printer software as well. Color has<br>
been supported since LaserWriter driver 6.0, for color depths of 8 bits or less.<br>
Depths greater than 8 bits must be converted before printing.
</p>
<p>
There really isn't any simple way to match up the version of released printer software<br>
with what version of the system it is compatible. LaserWriter 7.x is compatible with<br>
both System 7 and System 6. It's still prerelease software, however. Do not ship the<br>
preliminary LaserWriter 7.x driver with your application. You'll be able to ship the<br>
final LaserWriter 7 driver with your product as soon as System 7 is final.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>How can I use SndPlay to function asynchronously? It seems to ignore the async</i><br>
<i>parameter.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>To use SndPlay asynchronously, you must have allocated a sound channel without<br>
passing NIL as the chan parameter. There is one thing to be aware of in doing this,<br>
which often confuses developers. If the 'snd' resource being used with SndPlay<br>
specifies a 'snth' resource, then you cannot create the sound channel with a synth.<br>
Because of a Sound Manager bug that has been present in all releases through System<br>
6.0.7, SndPlay has not worked correctly for a 'snd' resource specifying a 'snth', with a<br>
user channel initialized with a 'snth'. For example, the following code will fail:
</p>
<pre>SndNewChannel(myChan,  sampledSound, init, @myCallBack);</pre>
<pre>SndPlay(myChan, sndHdl,  async);
    {sndHdle is a sampled sound}</pre>
<p>
The Sound Manager attempts to link this 'snth' to the channel with every call to<br>
SndPlay. If the synthesizer has already been installed, the Sound Manager attempts to<br>
install it again, only this time as a modifier. The same 'snth' code ends up being<br>
installed more than once in the channel. If the 'snd' contains 'snth' information, then<br>
SndPlay can be used once and only once on a channel. A format 2 'snd' resource is<br>
assumed to be a sampled sound. For format 1, check the number of snths specified in<br>
the 'snd' and then check each one. The latest version of SoundApp has source code that<br>
does these tests.
</p>
<p>
This limitation has been fixed in System 7. In System 7, SndPlay can be called any<br>
number of times on a channel. For older system releases you need to create and dispose<br>
of the channel each time after calling SndPlay, as in the following code:
</p>
<pre>#include   &lt;Resources.h&gt;
#include   &lt;Sound.h&gt;

#define   TRUE  0xFF
#define   FALSE 0

main()
{
    Handle          Sound;
    SndChannelPtr   chan;
    int             i;
    OSErr           err;
   
    Sound = GetResource('snd', 100);
    if (ResError() != noErr || Sound == nil)
    Debugger();
   
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i)
    {
        chan = nil;
        err = SndNewChannel(
            &amp;chan, 0, 0, nil);
        if (err != noErr)
            Debugger();
   
        err = SndPlay (chan,
            Sound, FALSE);
        if (err != noErr)
            Debugger();
    }
}</pre>
<p>
A good method for playing sampled sound asynchronously on any Macintosh is to create<br>
a sound channel&nbsp;&nbsp;and use the bufferCmd. Find the sound header from the 'snd ' resource<br>
and pass the pointer to&nbsp;&nbsp;this in the bufferCmd. Use this with SndDoCommand or<br>
SndDoImmediate. To determine when the sound has completed so that you can know<br>
when&nbsp;&nbsp;to dispose of the channel, send a bufferCmd with SndDoCommand (in order to<br>
queue it)&nbsp;&nbsp;after the bufferCmd. Once your callback procedure is called, set a global<br>
signalling that&nbsp;&nbsp;the sound has finished. The new Sound Manager (System 6.0.7 and<br>
beyond) supports a new call, SndChannelStatus, which&nbsp;&nbsp;will tell you if the channel is<br>
playing a sound or not. Instead of the callback procedure,&nbsp;&nbsp;you can poll the channel&#8217;s<br>
status to determine when to dispose of the channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;Example code using the callback<br>
procedure can be found in the DTS sample code SoundApp.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> What is the difference between North and West?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>North is an absolute direction on the globe. Once you are on the North Pole it is<br>
impossible to go any&nbsp;&nbsp;"further North." West, on the other hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;is a relative position.<br>
No matter where you are on the surface of the Earth, it&#8217;s always possible to go further<br>
West.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>I have found that sounds recorded at good or better quality will not play with system</i><br>
<i>software prior to 6.0.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#8217;s expected, but the fact that SndPlay does not return an</i><br>
<i>error message is not.&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I check to see if a sound is compressed when running</i><br>
<i>older system software?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>There is a byte in the SoundHeader&nbsp;&nbsp;data structure (and thus in a 'snd' resource),<br>
called "encode." If the sound is compressed,&nbsp;&nbsp;the value of this byte will be $FE, which<br>
is defined as the constant cmpSH in the headers for the Sound Manager.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Why do golf balls have pocks?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>As counter intuitive as it may seem&nbsp;&nbsp;at first, the pocks on golf balls actually make<br>
them fly farther. A golf ball builds turbulence in front of it as it flies through the air.<br>
If the ball is pocked, the turbulence &#8220;fills&#8221; the pockets as the ball spins, resulting in<br>
less resistance and more flight. 747s have pocks on their wings for the same reason.<br>
Dolphins presumably have these pocks on their fins for this purpose as well, but to<br>
date none of them have come out publicly and said so.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>We generate sounds using the Sound Driver&#8217;s four-tone synthesizer. Our application</i><br>
<i>must run on all Macintosh computers and all system software versions starting with</i><br>
<i>System 6.0.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>According to an early version of</i> Inside Macintosh<i>, Volume VI, the new Sound Manager's</i><br>
<i>wave-table synthesizer, which replaces the Sound Driver's four-tone synthesizer,</i><br>
<i>does not perform as expected on some Macintosh systems. When should we use the</i><br>
<i>Sound Manager and when should we use the Sound Driver? </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>The Sound Driver is no longer supported, as of System 6.0.7. The wave-form<br>
synthesizer in the Sound Manager released with 6.0.7 does not work correctly for<br>
non-Apple Sound Chip machines (Macintosh Plus, SE, Classic, and LC), but this will<br>
be fixed in System 7. If you need to use the wave-form synthesizer for non-ASC<br>
machines running 6.0.7, you could try the Sound Driver with 6.0.7 on the chance it'll<br>
work for your purpose. Use the Sound Driver for non-ASC machines running System<br>
6.0.5 and earlier. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Does stereo work? I was hoping to init the left and right channels separately </i><br>
<i>(using</i><code>initChanLeft </code><i>and</i><code> initChanRight</code><i>) and send different sampled sounds out</i><br>
<i>both channels. But the Sound Manager documentation says stereo is not supported. I</i><br>
<i>figured this would be a "cheap" way of playing two sounds at the same time, sending</i><br>
<i>them out the left and right channels and letting the Macintosh mix them together (or</i><br>
<i>telling the user to flip the MONO switch on their stereo).</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Stereo and mixing multiple channels are new features of the Sound Manager released<br>
with System 6.0.7. If you create a mono channel, the sounds come out both speakers. If<br>
you create a left channel, it is a mono sound coming from only the left channel.<br>
Alternatively, creating a right channel will only come from the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you create a<br>
stereo channel, then the sound's left or right position is determined by the sound<br>
header you use (with the bufferCmd). A stereo sound is only supported by a<br>
compressed or extended sound header.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot control the left or right panning of a<br>
stereo sound. This is only determined by the sound header and its interleaved data. The<br>
left or right init params will have no affect on a stereo channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True stereo sounds<br>
can only occur by using a stereo sound header. Two mono channels, one for the left<br>
speaker and one for the right, could be opened for the affect that most developers want.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Only the Macintosh SE/30 and the Macintosh IIsi have both the left and right sources<br>
mixed to the internal speaker. A stereo sound on all other Macintosh systems have the<br>
left source only sent to the internal speaker. The right source is only sent to the<br>
external port, and it isn't possible to determine if the external port is in use or not.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>Is it necessary to lock a 'snd' resource that is to be played asynchronously with</i><br>
<i>SndPlay?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Yes, if you are playing a sound resource asynchronously with SndPlay, then you have<br>
to lock the sound. SndPlay will restore the handle's state as soon as the trap returns to<br>
the caller. If the call is asynchronous, the handle's state is restored immediately after<br>
calling SndPlay, before the sound finishes playing.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i>When converting stacks from HyperCard 1.2.5 to 2.0, the default "fixed line height"</i><br>
<i>setting for text fields sometimes enlarges the space required by text and destroys the</i><br>
<i>layout of the screen. For example,text tends to disappear outside the edges of the field,</i><br>
<i>or be misaligned. Deselecting "fixed line height" corrects the problem in most</i><br>
<i>instances, but there can still be a slight discrepancy in the amount of space taken up</i><br>
<i>by identical fonts in identical fields between 1.2.5 and 2.0, such that layouts are</i><br>
<i>disrupted even if "fixed line height" is not selected. </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Inherent in the design of HyperCard 2.0, the way a field is displayed may&nbsp;&nbsp;be<br>
different in HyperCard 2.0 than&nbsp;&nbsp;in HyperCard 1.2.5. Converting a&nbsp;&nbsp;stack to HyperCard<br>
2.0 from HyperCard 1.2.5 may require that&nbsp;&nbsp;fields be tweaked to appear properly.<br>
Therefore, developers may want to provide special versions of their stacks for use<br>
with HyperCard 2.0, regardless of whether features specific to HyperCard 2.0 are<br>
incorporated.

<b>Q</b><i>Since I have received HyperCard 2.0 I have converted several stacks for 1.x to 2.0</i><br>
<i>and have experienced several problems with scripts that worked fine in 1.x. I have</i><br>
<i>recently learned that HyperCard 1.x will NOT run on System 6.0.7 and later versions.</i><br>
<i>For HyperCard 1.x users this results in stacks that cannot be used in HyperCard 2.0.</i><br>
<i>For HyperCard stack developers this presents a nightmare in converting old 1.x stacks</i><br>
<i>for users into 2.0 stacks. Since encountering these problems I have changed my</i><br>
<i>scripts in 1.x so that when converted they work. What is Apple's position on "seamless</i><br>
<i>conversion" of HyperCard 1.x stacks to HyperCard 2.0?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b>Most functioning 1.x scripts will work without modification under HyperCard 2.0.<br>
However, HyperCard 2.0 is a bit more strict in enforcing some of the grammar of<br>
HyperTalk. For example, keywords can no longer be used as variable names under 2.0.<br>
Under 1.x, keywords could be used as variable names, but the documentation<br>
specifically warned against doing this.
