<h2>LETTERS</h2>
I encountered a technical error in the Macintosh Q &amp; A section in the latest issue of <br>
<i>develop</i> . The question was: "Is the maximum size for global and local data still 32K?"<br>
The answer stated that the 32K limit for local (stack) data "is basically due to the<br>
Motorola processor architecture." As stated in the answer, the LINK instruction is<br>
limited to a 16-bit offset. Unstated in the answer is that the compiler can easily work<br>
around this limitation. Suppose your program declares 50K bytes of local data. The<br>
compiler should generate a LINK instruction for the first 32K bytes and then adjust<br>
the stack for the remaining 18K bytes needed by the routine. If the program is<br>
compiled specifically for the 68020 or 68030, the compiler can issue a LINKL (link<br>
long) instruction, which allows a full 32- bit offset.<br>

<i>Thanks for the clarification. You're absolutely right, but of course for most of us it</i><br>
<i>doesn't make any difference; we don't write our compilers, we're slaves to them. I</i><br>

<i>handle local data." All you aspiring compiler writers, take note.</i><br>

After receiving <i>Gorillas in the Disc (Developer CD Series </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume VI) a few months<br>
ago, I checked out the electronic versions of the <i> develop </i> issues that we did not have in<br>
hardcopy, and came across something that prompted me to write. I was reading the<br>
letters in <i> develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 2 (April 1990) and saw a letter and response in which you<br>
mentioned the "ever-popular audio track" from the <i> develop</i> CD.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we are an<br>
Apple Partner, our copy of <i> develop </i> contains a card telling us that Developer<br>
Essentials will be included in a folder on our <i> Developer CD Series </i> disc. Imagine my<br>
disappointment when I realized that the disc Apple Partners received contained no<br>
audio track. What a crime to deprive all us Partners of such a bonus! Please tell your<br>
people that Partners want their audio!<br>
--Bill Stoker

<p>
<i>The Developer CD Series disc contains a superset of what's on the disc that's bound into</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;develop<i> (now called the Developer Essentials disc). Volume III of the Developer CD</i><br>
<i>Series ("A Disc Called Wanda") corresponds to </i> develop <i>Issue 2 and does indeed contain</i><br>
<i>the ever-popular audio track, as part of the CD Audio Toolkit demo. Were you looking</i><br>
<i>for an audio track on the latest Developer CD Series disc? If so, you would in fact not</i><br>
<i>find one there; there wasn't one on the corresponding Developer Essentials disc,</i><br>
<i>either. Rest assured that we won't deprive Apple Partners of any of the goodies we</i><br>
<i>provide on the Developer Essentials disc!</i><br>

<p>
First let me say that <i>develop </i> is great!
</p>
<p>
I read on page 5 of the latest issue that your group is now responsible for the <br>
<i>Developer CD Series</i> .<i>Gorillas in the Disc</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;is a bit of a disappointment. Not a lot of<br>
really new stuff on it. That's not your fault, I know. There must be neat stuff floating<br>
around in Apple somewhere!
</p>
<p>
Someone decided that the Q &amp; A Stack should contain both Macintosh and Apple II GS<br>
stuff. Boo, hiss! I tend to read through that stack looking for stuff I don't know, before I<br>
know I need to know it! I was really confused by things that I had never heard of on the<br>
Macintosh before, only to find they were on the Apple IIGS! Arrggh! Can you please<br>
separate the II GS stuff and the Macintosh stuff into two stacks? And can you please go<br>
back to the format of putting dots beside the new stuff?
</p>
<p>
The X Ref stuff is kinda neat. Can't wait for 7.0 aliasing!<br>

<i>Thanks a lot for your letter and your words of encouragement. My group contributes to</i><br>
<i>the Developer CD Series, but we're not actually responsible for it. Besides adding more</i><br>
<i>new "neat" stuff, is there anything we could do to improve the disc? We're always</i><br>
<i>looking for suggestions!Sorry to hear that adding Apple&nbsp;&nbsp;IIGS stuff to the Q &amp; A stack</i><br>
<i>confused you so much (but I'm awfully glad to hear that you're browsing the Q &amp; A</i><br>
<i>stack!). We put the II GS info in the stack hoping that Macintosh developers would see</i><br>
<i>how similar the two toolboxes are and perhaps get some extra mileage from their work</i><br>
<i>by porting their Macintosh application to the IIGS. It sounds like it's more confusing</i><br>
<i>than helpful, so we'll reevaluate our decision. What do the rest of you think about</i><br>
<i>combining II GS and Macintosh information in one stack?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>In reply to your request for dots: The latest Q &amp; A Stack has been reworked so much it's</i><br>
<i>practically all new, but in the future you can expect to once again see dots beside new</i><br>
<i>material. Also note that, starting with the latest stack, each card will show the date of</i><br>
<i>the last modification.</i><br>
<i>--Louella Pizzuti</i>Just a quick note to congratulate you and your staff on another fine<br>
issue of <i> develop </i> (and in the hopes that I won't see a survey). I read it cover to cover,<br>
and thoroughly enjoyed it, especially the Macintosh Q &amp; A. I kept turning the page<br>
expecting to have seen the last question answered, but lo and behold, there were more<br>
questions. It was better than Jeopardy. You really outdid yourselves!
</p>
<p>
Keep up the wonderful work, and please consider starting a new column: a soap opera<br>
about the dogcow.
</p>
<p>
By the way, whose nose is lighting up the cover?<br>
--Robert H. Zakon
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for the letter. If we ever do a survey (and my boss has been pushing me to do</i><br>
<i>one ever since Issue 2 came out), I'll make sure that the surveyors know you're</i><br>
<i>officially exempt.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The nose on the cover belongs to Cleo Huggins, who has done all our covers and nose</i><br>
<i>what she's doing.</i><br>
