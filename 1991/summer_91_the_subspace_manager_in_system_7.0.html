<p>
<i>It has long been a well-kept secret that among the many innovative and controversial</i><br>
<i>aspects of the original Macintosh design--such as bitmapped graphics, iconic</i><br>
<i>interfaces, and excessive disk swapping--was hardware capable of accessing subspace</i><br>
<i>fractal strings. Until now, there has been no system software means of accessing this</i><br>
<i>hardware. But with System 7.0 comes the Subspace Manager, an access path to the</i><br>
<i>underlying subspace transceiver available in every Macintosh. Now the truth can be</i><br>
<i>told--and this article tells it.</i>
</p>
<p>
While the Macintosh was being designed, a small group of researchers at the Pacific<br>
Alternative Reality Center discovered a simple means of accessing subspace. The<br>
method they developed could be incorporated into virtually any integrated circuit,<br>
requiring very little space. The Apple development team, aware of this work via<br>
personal contacts with the group, decided to incorporate a subspace transceiver into<br>
the IWM chip. 
</p>
<p>
Almost from the first day, the decision to include a subspace facility was<br>
controversial. Many thought that the device was simply a toy and would keep the<br>
Macintosh from being accepted in the business market. Others felt that the device<br>
might be dangerous and worried about getting UL approval. Still others were concerned<br>
about adding yet another chapter to<i>Inside Macintosh. </i>
</p>
<p>
In the end, a compromise was worked out: the hardware was included in the Macintosh,<br>
but no means was provided to access it via the operating system. This allowed the<br>
facility to be included in the spec sheet, but kept it from slowing down third-party<br>
software developers. An early version of MacWrite used the facility to enable<br>
interstellar collaborative editing, but the collaborative aspects were eliminated by<br>
Marketing for being too far ahead of their time and thus confusing to users. 
</p>
<p>
When the ASC chip was added to later Macintosh models, an improved subspace<br>
transceiver was included. But once again, due to a slight management error--the<br>
resources intended to be used to develop the Subspace Manager were instead used for a<br>
four-day party in Monterey--no means of accessing the transceiver was made<br>
available. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, during the development of System 7.0, someone said, "Hell, we've got<br>
everything else in it, why not add the Subspace Manager too." And so it was done.<br>
Unfortunately, the contents page of<i>Inside Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume VI was frozen before a<br>
chapter on the Subspace Manager could be added. This article takes the place of that<br>
chapter.
</p>
<h2>ABOUT THE SUBSPACE MANAGER</h2>
<p>
The Subspace Manager is the part of the operating system that handles communication<br>
between the application and the subspace transceiver in the IWM or ASC chip. The<br>
Subspace Manager includes routines to access specific subspace dimensional strings<br>
and transmission frequencies, subintegral dimensional storage, and the underlying<br>
physical constants. Higher-level routines provide access to structured storage as<br>
defined by Intragalactic Standards Organization (ISO) document<br>
332.12.2234.2313.22.123a:<i> Interspecies Data Standards</i> , Subspace Storage and<br>
Retrieval, Structured Formats, Access Methods, subsection J, revision 1822. 
</p>
<p>
<b>SUBSPACE AND FRACTAL STRINGS</b><br>
To use the Subspace Manager properly, you need to understand what subspace is and<br>
how fractal strings work.
</p>
<p>
The universe is composed of billions (and billions) of strings, all intricately<br>
interwoven. Collectively these strings are known as<i>subspace</i> . Each individual string is<br>
a zero-dimensional point fractally interwoven through the local space-time<br>
continuum, bounded by mass concentrations (which distort the spatial geometry and<br>
thereby contain the strings). Because a string has zero dimensions, the concept of<br>
transit time across the string is meaningless. Because it's fractal, it achieves<br>
connectivity with a large area in space.
</p>
<p>
Each fractal string has a unique fractal number that can be used to identify that<br>
specific string. No other string can have exactly the same fractal dimension, as a<br>
consequence of Boorman's conservation of dimensionality principle<br>
(CoDP--pronounced "cod pee"). CoDP provides a convenient means of addressing a<br>
particular string:
</p>
<pre> TYPE CoDPNumber = EXTENDED;</pre>
<p>
<b>THE SUBSPACE TRANSCEIVER</b><br>
The subspace transceiver in the Macintosh works by creating a subspace resonance<br>
chamber, empty of any strings, and then "intruding" a length of a single string. The<br>
influence on the string is directly proportional to the length of the string intruded.<br>
Even though the lengths are measured in parsecs, the nature of fractal strings allows<br>
the entire length to be intruded into a chamber that fits within a small part of an<br>
integrated circuit.
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Note:</b> Observant readers will note that although strings are described as<br>
zero-dimensional, we can also speak of the length of a portion of string. This is not the<br>
contradiction it seems at first glance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the mathematics needed to illustrate<br>
this fact are beyond the scope of this document. 
</p>
<p>
Subspace string intrusion is commonly called<i>string sucking</i> in the technical<br>
literature.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the origin of the popular song "Suckin' in the Subspace," written<br>
and originally performed by The Fracs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The (totally unsubstantiated) claim is made<br>
that during the band's last performance of this song they hit precisely the right<br>
frequency (just under F sharp) and were themselves sucked into subspace using no<br>
more instrumentality than a poorly tuned guitar. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Warning: </b>Don't try this with your Macintosh. 
</p>
<p>
<b>THE INTRAGALACTIC SUBSPACE ENCYCLOPEDIA</b><br>
In an effort to share information with other species in the same gravitational<br>
neighborhood, certain strings have been set aside as a community-access encyclopedia.<br>
The format of the encyclopedia is defined by the ISO. Details of these standards are<br>
available via the encyclopedia itself. The Subspace Manager includes a high-level<br>
interface to the encyclopedia. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Warning: </b>Members of some civilizations have decided not only not to contribute to<br>
the encyclopedia, but also to actively disrupt it. These species make changes to existing<br>
entries in the encyclopedia, rendering the content questionable and even dangerous. For<br>
example, the entry on Earth was changed by one of these species to read "a mostly<br>
harmless planet run by small white mice." Of course, Earth authorities immediately<br>
changed it back to "a mostly harmless planet run by large multicolored apes."
</p>
<h2>HIGH-LEVEL SUBSPACE MANAGER ROUTINES</h2>
<p>
This section describes the high-level Pascal interface to the Subspace Manager.<br>
Because of space constraints, low-level Pascal routines are not described in this<br>
article, but we're sure you can figure them out yourself. 
</p>
<pre>FUNCTION SSInitialize (pi: EXTENDED; e: EXTENDED): OSErr;</pre>
<p>
SSInitialize initializes the hardware, evacuates the intrusion chamber, and tests the<br>
local values of pi and e against those given. If pi and e do not match those of the local<br>
reality, SSInitialize returns ssWrongReality; otherwise it returns noErr. 
</p>
<p>
<b>TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING</b>
</p>
<pre>FUNCTION SSTransmit (p: CoDPNumber; VAR count: LONGINT;
    buffPtr: Ptr):OSErr;</pre>
<p>
SSTransmit attempts to send the bytes found at buffPtr, of length count, via the set of<br>
strings starting at p. It chooses a series of string numbers based on p, as needed to<br>
contain the entire block of data. The algorithm for choosing the string number sequence<br>
is defined in the ISO document.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides being an accepted standard, the sequences are<br>
chosen to maximize the string intrusion rate (the "suck"). Upon return, count reflects<br>
the actual number of bytes transmitted. 
</p>
<pre>FUNCTION SSReceive (p: CoDPNumber; VAR count: LONGINT;
    buffPtr: Ptr):OSErr;</pre>
<p>
SSReceive attempts to receive, from the strings starting at p, the number of bytes<br>
specified by count, placing the received bytes in buffPtr. As with SSTransmit, a<br>
sequence of string numbers is chosen based on the original p.
</p>
<p>
<b>ACCESSING THE INTRAGALACTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA</b>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<pre>FUNCTION SSEncycEntry (p: CoDPNumber; VAR entryTitle:
    Str255; VAR entry: Handle): OSErr;</pre>
<p>
SSEncycEntry attempts to retrieve the encyclopedia entry at string p. It places the<br>
title of the entry into entryTitle and returns the contents of the entry in a handle. It is<br>
the responsibility of the application to dispose of the entry handle when finished with<br>
it. 
</p>
<p>
All entries in the encyclopedia are written in the native language of the originators of<br>
the encyclopedia concept--the Herbans. SSEncycEntry automatically translates<br>
encyclopedia entries from Herbaneeze into English. However, the system can handle<br>
only a limited subset of entries from the entire encyclopedia. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Note:</b> No high-level access is provided to write new entries in the encyclopedia. If,<br>
however, you must have write access to the encyclopedia, you can use the low-level<br>
interface. This will require you to write an English-to-Herbaneeze translator. System<br>
8.0 will include a bidirectional Herbaneeze translator as part of the Universal<br>
Translator Package. 
</p>
<p>
<b>CHANGING REALITY</b><br>
One of the many consequences of CoDP (the conservation of dimensionality principle)<br>
is that each alternative reality has its own unique set of physical constants. In<br>
addition, it follows directly from Malanthorpin's theorem of constant universality that<br>
only two constants are needed to define a reality, because all other constants can be<br>
derived from those two, and that any two constants are sufficient. 
</p>
<p>
The Macintosh subspace transceiver has the ability to change the physical constants of<br>
the current reality, thus moving the reality into a new Herzhold plane. 
</p>
<pre>FUNCTION SSChangeReality (newPi: Extended; newE: Extended): OSErr;</pre>
<p>
SSChangeReality attempts to change the current reality's physical constants. If another<br>
reality already exists with the new constants, SSChangeReality returns<br>
ssRealityExists. If the reality change was successful, it returns noErr. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Changing the physical constants of reality almost always causes the destruction of all<br>
life. To make sure that this is the real intent of the user, a new type of alert is<br>
included with the Subspace Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alert is invoked with the function<br>
EndOfWorldAlert. 
</p>
<pre>FUNCTION EndOfWorldAlert (alertID: INTEGER; filterProc: ProcPtr)
        :INTEGER;</pre>
<p>
This alert works the same as the StopAlert, NoteAlert, and CautionAlert functions,<br>
except that it uses a different icon, as shown in Figure 1. Physical reality constants<br>
should be changed only if the user clicks the OK button in the alert.

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;This article has described the Subspace Manager available with System 7.0. This new<br>
facility provides many powerful capabilities, and should result in many new and<br>
exciting applications for the Macintosh. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The story is widely told that sometime in the last century, the legislature of Indiana<br>
passed a law declaring that pi would henceforth be exactly 3, with the intent to<br>
decrease the cost of teaching that portion of mathematics. This story is untrue: in fact,<br>
the law was proposed but was defeated. If the Indiana legislature had only had a<br>
Macintosh with a Subspace Manager, they could have actually succeeded in changing pi<br>
to 3. And they may yet.

<b>&nbsp;HARRY CHESLEY</b> has had a fascination with subspace ever since discovering a<br>
wormhole in his bathtub at age five. Spending much of his youth in subspace and his<br>
college years as an exchange student on Pluto ("a real Mickey Mouse planet"), Harry<br>
has relentlessly pursued the study of subspace, putting him in an ideal position to<br>
write this article. Today he lives in subspace with his wife and daughter, and<br>
commutes to Apple. *

<p>
<b>&nbsp;The standard reference </b>on subspace is <i>Subspace Engineering--Theory and</i><br>
<i>Practice</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;by MacMillon and Boorman (New York: Counterweight Press, 1957). The<br>
reader may also be interested in <i> Hummin' Beings, The Next Stage in Evolution</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;by<br>
Gregor Alman (Chicago: Omega Memes Press, 1997). In this book Alman argues that<br>
creatures capable of directly influencing subspace string frequencies are the next<br>
logical step in evolution. The fact that he completely misunderstands the concept of<br>
evolution and that there are no examples of his so-called hummin' beings listed<br>
anywhere in the Intragalactic Encyclopedia doesn't keep the book from being extremely<br>
entertaining. *
