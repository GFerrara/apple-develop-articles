<b>NEAT THREADS</b><br>
I've just finished experimentally adding the Threads Package to my current<br>
application. I was amazed at how painlessly it could be added. What I felt was truly<br>
remarkable was that I use THINK C'sTM object-oriented extensions (which I refer to<br>
as C+-) along with the THINK Class Library, and it took less than 10 minutes to<br>
perform all the necessary conversions. Pretty neat.<br>
<p>
I'm linking to ask whether you have any information about using the Threads Package<br>
with THINK C and TCL, and whether there are any special considerations involved in<br>
using threads with or inside methods. Just using them inside a method with a single<br>
instance, with no reference to instance variables, is demonstrably effective, but this<br>
case is logically indistinguishable from conventional code. I suspect that use with<br>
objects might require custom fSwapIn and fCopyContext routines to preserve <b>this,</b><br>
the handle to the object's instance. In THINK C, <b> this </b>is internally kept in an address<br>
register.
</p>
<p>
If the default context-saving routines save A0-A4 register states as well as the stack,<br>
<b>this </b>should automatically be preserved. Whether registers are preserved does not<br>
seem to be documented in your otherwise nifty <i>develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;article. Logic says some must<br>
be preserved (A5 at least), but have you been prescient enough to save all of them?<br>
--Kirk Kerekes
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for your truly inspiring link! It really makes a difference for me to get</i><br>
<i>feedback like this. I don't foresee any special problems threading THINK C code. All the</i><br>
<i>data and address registers are saved. The FPU registers are saved only if you</i><br>
<i>specifically request that they be saved at InitThreads time, and then only when you</i><br>
<i>have an FPU. Remember to be careful about segment unloading.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I'm at your service if you need any help with threads. Feel free to contact me by</i><br>
<i>telephone. My number is (408)974-0355.</i><br>

<b>MISSING SNIPPETS</b><br>
Am I blind? Issue 6 of <i>develop, </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;page 88, talks about code snippets, but I can't find<br>
them anywhere. Are they inside a stack somewhere, or did they miss getting on the CD?<br>
--Greg Johnson
</p>
<p>
<i>You are not blind. Snippets did not make it onto that CD, but they've made it onto the</i><br>
<i>Developer Essentials disc for this issue of </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;develop<i>. They're also available via</i><br>
<i>AppleLink&#174;, in the Developer Technical Support folder on the Developer Services</i><br>
<i>Bulletin Board, as well as in the Dev Tech Answers library.</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>MISSING TRUETYPE INIT</b><br>
Recently I received Issue 6 of <i> develop</i> . I enjoy reading the articles and would like to<br>
make a comment.
</p>
<p>
Since Apple is distributing a TrueTypeTM INIT for System 6.0.7, why didn't you put it<br>
on the CD of Issue 6? I hope I can find it in the next issue even though System 7.0 is<br>
now available.<br>
--Tetsuya Ishikawa
</p>
<p>
<i>I hope we can fulfill other people's wishes as easily as we did yours. The TrueType INIT</i><br>
<i>for System 6.0.7 is now on the CD in the folder with the System; an oversight kept it</i><br>
<i>off of the last CD.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>As with all old System software, we're providing this INIT so you can test your</i><br>
<i>software with it (just in case you've got some as-yet-unupgraded users). When</i><br>
<i>testing with the TrueType INIT, make sure you use it only with System 6.0.7; that's</i><br>
<i>the only System it's designed to work with.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Happy testing,--Caroline Rose</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>DISAPPOINTING CD</b><br>
I must admit to being disappointed with the CD-ROM disc that came with Issue 6: Tech<br>
Notes "stuck" back in 12/90, no Volume VI of <i> Inside Macintosh</i> , just HyperCard&#174;<br>
alone rather than a developer's edition, no System 7.0. Should I expect that my<br>
perception that the disc is out-of-touch, out-of-date, and insufficient will be<br>
permanent? That is, <i> develop </i> is not really meant to be a real developer-support<br>
package for the individual (noncorporate) developer operating on a shoe string?<br>
Thanks for any insight you can give me.<br>
--Pete Roberts
</p>
<p>
<i>I certainly hope your perception that the disc is out-of-touch, out-of-date, and</i><br>
<i>insufficient will not be permanent. We collect and press as much as we can, but</i><br>
<i>because we want subscribers to get </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;develop <i>regularly, we don't hold the presses for</i><br>
<i>software or documentation that isn't quite ready yet, as was the case last time for</i><br>
<i>System 7.0 and Inside Macintosh Volume VI. They're both on this issue's disc. The Tech</i><br>
<i>Notes on Issue 6's disc were actually updated through February 1991. (Well, the stack</i><br>
<i>version was, anyway; the MacWrite&#174; version wasn't, and we apologize for the</i><br>
<i>oversight.)</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>As for the developer edition of HyperCard, Claris Corporation no longer allows us to</i><br>
<i>distribute it.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>We'll continue to do our best to give you the latest, greatest information possible!</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>WHERE'S LOUELLA?</b><br>
Congratulations, Caroline, on your new job as Editor-in-Cheek of <i> develop</i> . I hope you<br>
have as much fun at it as Louella had.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the riddle at the end of your first editorial. We've been scratching our<br>
heads over it for a while. The closest thing to a guess we can come up with is that you<br>
used either a tablet or some other alternative text entry device. You probably were<br>
able to emulate the mouse as well as the keyboard. Why? Perhaps to demonstrate that<br>
handicapped people can have access to the Macintosh.
</p>
<p>
A humble suggestion: I've saved all the CD-ROMs that have come with your magazine (<br>
<i>develop</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;the CD, aka <i>develop</i> , the disc, aka <i>Developer Essentials</i> ). How about designing<br>
inserts for the CD cases that some of us keep their CD-ROMs in? Something we could<br>
print on thick paper, cut out, and stick in the plastic boxes to label the contents. Keep<br>
up the good work!<br>
--Lyle D. Gunderson
</p>
<p>
P.S. I tried to send mail to Louella at pizzuti1@applelink.apple.com, but your system<br>
denied knowing about her. Any help you could give me in addressing e-mail to her<br>
would be very much appreciated.
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks for the nice letter. I'm having more fun than I've ever had on a job.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Regarding the answer to my riddle: If you've read this issue's editorial, you know by</i><br>
<i>now that you were barking up the right tree. Other readers who replied did not think of</i><br>
<i>access by people with physical limitations.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I hope I've succeeded in doing some consciousness raising here. Your idea about the</i><br>
<i>insert is a good one. We didn't manage to get it onto this issue's disc, but we'll try for</i><br>
<i>next time. It sounds as if you're holding on to all the old discs. If so, be careful about</i><br>
<i>using stuff on them, because we update software and generally attempt to correct the</i><br>
<i>mistakes of the past with each new disc.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Louella decided that there was after all no job as much fun as being editor of </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;develop<i>,</i><br>
<i>so she retired to raise flowers in Holland. Just kidding. You can reach her at</i><br>
<i>louella@applelink.apple.com.</i><br>

<b>POLES AND FONTS</b><br>
Two things I'd like to mention after reading Issue 5 (Volume 2, Issue 1):
</p>
<p>
First, I'm not sure that the answer to the question "What is the difference between<br>
North and West?" is completely correct. To my mind, there are two points on the globe<br>
from which one would be hard pressed to go further West (or East): the North and<br>
South Poles.
</p>
<p>
Second, may I make a typographic recommendation? Please use Courier for "computer<br>
voice" (program listings and the like). Prestige Elite is ugly and too lightweight. The<br>
Bitstream &#174; Courier family has a good regular weight and a bold that would be<br>
compatible with your Futura headings.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and without being too dogmatic, I disagree that a spacious layout is necessarily<br>
more effective or attractive.<br>
--Toby Thain
</p>
<p>
<i>You're right, we mistakenly left out the South Pole. Those PR folks for the North Pole</i><br>
<i>do a really good job at making you forget that the other pole exists at all (especially in</i><br>
<i>December, and that was after all our Winter issue). Thanks for the correction.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I'm not sure I agree that Prestige Elite is ugly, but it does bother me that its hyphen</i><br>
<i>(what's typed for a minus sign in code) is so narrow and its O (Oh) and 0 (zero) are</i><br>
<i>not very easily distinguishable. So in this issue we have indeed switched to Bitstream</i><br>
<i>Courier, which solves these problems and has the right weight.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The beauty of a particular font or layout is surely in the eye of the beholder; I've heard</i><br>
<i>at least as many positive responses as negative ones to the choices we've made for </i> <br>
develop. <i>We hope that you and others will keep giving us specific feedback so we'll</i><br>
<i>know what's working and what isn't.</i><br>
<i>--Caroline Rose</i>
