<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>
<h1>CAROLINE ROSE</h1>

</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Dear Readers,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I'd like to bring up a subject that's been on my mind lately and a matter of interest to<br>
me--and probably to many of you--for quite some time now. It's the subject of what<br>
we called the "paperless office" as far back as the Seventies, when I worked in the<br>
same group as Doug Engelbart, inventor of the mouse. I laughed to myself back then<br>
when I'd hear predictions that in ten years or so, manuals would be obsolete. Who<br>
needs information in any form other than electronic? Printed manuals persist, but<br>
they're definitely an endangered species. At Apple and many other companies like it,<br>
the trend is toward "on-line only" dissemination of information: it uses the technology<br>
in zippy ways, it costs less, and it saves trees. Who needs paper, anyway?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I myself don't care if I ever see most memos, notes, reports, and similar daily<br>
jottings in print. I prefer to file the majority of this stuff on-line rather than in my<br>
physical file cabinets, which I mostly use to hold rice cakes and pistachio nuts. When I<br>
need a reminder of some technical information like the meaning of a parameter or the<br>
definition of a word, I like quick on-line access to it as much as the next person. And<br>
Balloon Help is great when I'm wondering what a particular command or button is for.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;But when I don't know how to do something at all, or how different pieces fit together,<br>
I prefer to read printed documentation. I'm speaking here of the background material<br>
that's needed to get you launched on a particular product in a way that will make you<br>
really know what it's about. (Whether this information is needed at all could be the<br>
subject of another editorial.) Call it "concepts" versus "reference." For me, there's<br>
nothing like reading about concepts in a real book when and where I want. The image<br>
that comes to mind is "curling up in front of a fire." I'd much sooner do that with a good<br>
novel than a technical manual, but still I like to pick a place and time away from my<br>
computer to take in the concepts. It's quieter and more comfortable, especially on my<br>
eyes, and it's a more pleasing visual and tactile experience. I learn more that way.<br>
Later, I might want to look up some conceptual material on-line, but for first-time<br>
reading and learning, I want hard copy.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;At the last company I worked for we surveyed a lot of developers on this, and most of<br>
them seemed to agree. We decided to divide our technical documentation along those<br>
exact lines: concepts versus reference; concepts would always be available as a printed<br>
manual while reference would be on-line only (or primarily, at least).
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;This all ties in with the fact that Apple Associates and Partners no longer receive a<br>
printed copy of<i> develop </i> as part of their regular mailing; they have to subscribe to <br>
<i>develop </i> to receive it in print. The mailing has been simplified to be just a CD-ROM<br>
disc and a 16-page publication in newspaper format that points to things on the disc.<br>
Those developers who don't want a lot of paper don't have to deal with it; those who do<br>
can order it. So Associates and Partners will cast their vote for paper<i>develop </i> by<br>
subscribing to it. (Letters from all of you expressing your opinions--especially when<br>
they agree with mine--are of course more than welcome.)
</p>
<p>
Speaking of electronic media, those of you who were receiving <i> develop </i> with its<br>
CD-ROM disc bound into it will notice that the disc corresponding to this issue has<br>
been packaged separately in its own case (made of partially recycled fiberboard and<br>
plastic). This should put a stop to the problem of mangled discs. Also, the disc is no<br>
longer the <i> Developer Essentials</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;disc, but the <i>Developer CD Series</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;disc, the same disc<br>
that Apple Associates and Partners receive. We hope this will make life easier for us<br>
and less confusing for you (not to mention that you'll get more goodies on the disc than<br>
before!).
</p>
<p>
I'll end with a vaguely related trivia question: What word was used instead of "click" to<br>
describe the action of pressing a button on that first mouse? If you've got any good<br>
trivia questions of your own, send them along to us. We need all the help we can get.

<b>&nbsp;Caroline Rose Editor</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>CAROLINE ROSE</b> has been writing computer documentation ever since "peripheral<br>
storage" meant paper tape. After a seven-year digression into programming, she<br>
returned to writing and joined Apple to document the inner workings of a new<br>
computer named Macintosh. In what proved to be another (five-year) digression, she<br>
left Apple to launch NeXT Computer's documentation effort--a real learning<br>
experience. She's thrilled to be back at Apple among old friends and new. Caroline loves<br>
to read, swim, hike, travel, dance, sing, and spend time with her best friend, Cleo (see<br>
photo). This summer she got her feet wet (literally) on a backpacking trip in Utah,<br>
through a tributary of the Escalante River and some pretty spectacular canyons. Her<br>
new wilderness goals are hiking up Half Dome and rafting the Colorado.<b> *</b>
