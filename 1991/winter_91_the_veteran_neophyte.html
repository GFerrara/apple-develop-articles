<h2>THE VETERAN NEOPHYTE</h2>
<h2>LISP, COLOR ICONS, AND LAYERS</h2>
<h1>DAVE JOHNSON</h1>
<p>
I recently started learning Lisp, in order to write&nbsp;&nbsp;a color icon editor for a project in<br>
ACOTSM (that's Apple Classroom of Tomorrow). The people behind ACOT are creating<br>
an environment in which kids can build and explore simulated ecologies, and I wanted<br>
to help, but didn't know Lisp well enough to be of much use. A color icon editor was<br>
needed, and it seemed like a straightforward and painless little project to cut&nbsp;&nbsp;my Lisp<br>
teeth on. Hah.
</p>
<p>
I did learn lots of Lisp, but I spent a disproportionate amount of time learning the<br>
low-level system interface in Macintosh Allegro Common Lisp (MCL) and wrestling<br>
Color QuickDraw to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you CopyBits fans, did you know that CopyBits<br>
always assumes that the destination PixMap is on the current GDevice? I guess I<br>
already knew this--it's documented all over the place--but the implications never<br>
affected me before. I needed to convert a 4-bit PixMap to 8 bits, so hey, let's use<br>
CopyBits, right? Wrong. The colors got munged every time, because color mapping<br>
kicked in and the source's color table didn't match the GDevice's. For the gory details,<br>
see Technical Note #277, especially the section on color mapping. If you like<br>
CopyBits, you'll<i>love</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;this tech note. 
</p>
<p>
I was curious what others thought of Lisp, so I asked around a little. Here are some of<br>
the responses I got:
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;Functional languages are cool if you have good libraries, but all those parentheses are</i><br>
<i>a pain in the ass.</i><br>
-- Bryan "Beaker" Ressler, C programmer.
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;It's the shortest distance between conception and realization.</i><br>
-- Matthew MacLaurin, self-admitted Lisp junkie.
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;I hate it.</i><br>
-- Neil Day, who was forced to write the&nbsp;&nbsp;Tower of Hanoi iteratively in an<br>
introductory Lisp course.
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;It's a great productivity tool, and Common Lisp provides a rich (though perhaps</i><br>
<i>Byzantine) programming environment.</i><br>
--Gregg Williams, technical writer and sometime Lisper.
</p>
<p>
<i>&nbsp;(expectant look)</i><br>
-- Natty, my dog.
</p>
<p>
There are several immediately apparent things about Lisp that are foreign to people<br>
used to C or Pascal. Data typing is nonexistent unless you want it: Any variable can<br>
hold any type of data at any time. Functions can be data, too, and can be passed around<br>
all over the place. Everything is cozily wrapped in parentheses many levels deep<br>
(after a while, this is somehow comforting). Context is all important and omnipresent.<br>
Changes can be immediately tried out, so forprototyping (and for those of us who<br>
thrive on immediate gratification) it's a joy to work in. For those lacking in<br>
discipline, Lisp can help to create a real mess (of course, any language can do that for<br>
you, it's just easier in Lisp). Because it is so forgiving, it encourages my own built-in<br>
"middle-out" design
</p>
<p>
strategy, which in the long run isn't terribly efficient, although lots of fun. With a<br>
little self-control, of course, this problem would go&nbsp;&nbsp;away (left as an exercise for the<br>
reader).
</p>
<p>
Writing Lisp code that is QuickDraw intensive is kind of a pain at first. MCL provides<br>
great libraries for basic QuickDraw tasks, but if you want to get fancy, you have to do<br>
it yourself. For the icon editor, I needed lots of little utility routines to do stuff like<br>
find a particular color's pixel value in the color table, add a color to a color table, copy<br>
a cicn, change the depth of a cicn, build new cicns from scratch. Nearly half my code<br>
consists of these little utilities. They'd be needed regardless of the language, I guess,<br>
but writing them in Lisp required me to learn the low-level system interface much<br>
more thoroughly than I originally intended. This made me grumble a little, but after<br>
I'd gotten over the initial syntactical hump, low-level access became transparent and<br>
largely effortless. 
</p>
<p>
The other half of the code was much Lispier. I used the built-in object system (Object<br>
Lisp, since I was using MCL 1.3.2. Now, in MCL version 2.0, it's the Common Lisp<br>
Object System, or CLOS), and I found that it successfully isolated me from most of the<br>
grungy system details like events and window handling (that's what it's supposed to do,<br>
right?).&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't done a lot of object programming, so I can't make incisive<br>
comparisons with other object systems, but I liked it.
</p>
<p>
The sort of layered, threaded structure of Lisp, and the continual "level switching" I<br>
had to do during development, got me thinking about how the machine is getting<br>
progressively more distant from the software I write. It seems that I write software to<br>
live on top of other software, not software to live on a machine. Object programming is<br>
a kind of layer creation, in that a well- designed object hides lots of details from the<br>
user of the object. MacApp is a layer (a thick one), HyperCard is also a layer&nbsp;&nbsp;(a<br>
<i>really </i> thick one), the Mac &#174; Toolbox is a layer, and so on.
</p>
<p>
More and more, programmers need to be comfortable stuffed between these layers.<br>
Here's the hard truth: YOU NO LONGER HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OF THE MACHINE. Once<br>
upon a time, in the dim and distant past, programmers had absolute power over every<br>
aspect of the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There wasn't even any such thing as a user! A programmer<br>
was God in a monotheistic universe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there are all sorts of software smoke<br>
screens between your code and the machine itself. You are no longer God; at best, you<br>
are a minor demigod in charge of shoes, or something. A long time ago I read a<br>
discussion of Macintosh programming, and one person compared it to sitting in a dark<br>
closet by yourself, and occasionally answering a note that is passed under the door<br>
from the outside. I think that's exaggerating a little, but the point is valid. You no<br>
longer need to know everything that's going on in the house; you can just be<br>
responsible for your own room. At least, that's the idea . . . 
</p>
<p>
One persistent problem is that you have to depend on the reliability of the other code.<br>
When my icon editor was almost done, I found a memory leak. Two tiny handles were<br>
left on the heap after closing the editor. It took me almost a week (and some expert<br>
help) to track it down to a bug in the MCL object system. Obviously, this diluted the<br>
benefits gained by using the system. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, though, I really do think that this division of labor, this layering, is a good<br>
thing. It lets people find the niche they like best, and ignore much of the rest if they<br>
want to. Often it is an incredible time-saver to learn to use others' code rather than<br>
learning to do what they did from scratch. Ideally, the layers will insulate you<br>
completely from irrelevant detail, and allow you to focus on your task. We're not there<br>
yet, but someday, maybe, you can actually stop inventing the wheel.
