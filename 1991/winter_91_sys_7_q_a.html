<h2>SYSTEM 7.0 Q &amp; A</h2>
<h1>MACINTOSH DEVELOPER TECHNICAL SUPPORT</h1>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>When I use the name and vRefNum returned from FindFolder, I always get a fnfErr</i><br>
<i>from OpenRFPerm. Why?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>FindFolder returns both a vRefNum and a DirID. They both must be used to identify<br>
the folder. Instead of using OpenRFPerm,which takes only a vRefNum, try<br>
HOpenResFile. Avoid using PBHSetVol!&nbsp;&nbsp;(See Technical Note #140 for more<br>
information.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>We want to use OpenCPicture&nbsp;&nbsp;for higher resolution, not for color per se. Can</i><br>
<i>OpenCPicture in System 7.0 be used with non-Color&nbsp;&nbsp;as well as Color QuickDraw</i><br>
<i>Macintosh computers?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Yes, with System 7.0, OpenCPicture&nbsp;&nbsp;can be used to create extended PICT2 files from<br>
all Macintosh computers. Under System 6.0.7 or later, you must test for 32-Bit<br>
QuickDraw before&nbsp;&nbsp;using OpenCPicture. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;do this by calling Gestalt with the<br>
gestaltQuickDrawVersion selector.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it returns gestalt32BitQD or greater, then<br>
32-Bit QuickDraw is installed.</p><p><b>Q </b><i>Can the Communications Toolbox be used in a DA?</i><br>
<i>InitCM has to be called and the manual says it should be called only once.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Yes, it is all right to call CTB Initialization routines from CODE resources. This<br>
includes a DRVR, cdev, or INIT.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>Can I use my 8*24 GC card with System 7.0&amp;szlig;x?&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told the GC misbehaves</i><br>
<i>with any and all nonlinear address mapping, such&nbsp;&nbsp;as System 7.0 and A/UX. Is this</i><br>
<i>true? Can this be fixed with CODE/INIT patch? Is it scheduled to be fixed in the near</i><br>
<i>future?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>The 8*24 GC card software version 1.0 is not intended to run in any environment<br>
involving virtual memory management. A VM-compatible version of the GC software<br>
will be made available when System 7.0 is final. Until then, the card can be&nbsp;&nbsp;used as a<br>
video buffer, and System 7.0 preliminary software might run with VM switched off.</p><p><b>Q</b>
<i>Under what System 7.0 and System 6.0 conditions is it legal to call the QDError</i><br>
<i>function?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Under System 7.0, QDError can be called from all Macintosh computers. (System<br>
7.0 supports RGBForeColor, RGBBackColor, GetForeColor, and GetBackColor for all<br>
Macintosh computers as well.) On a non-Color QuickDraw Macintosh, QDError always<br>
returns a "no error." Under System 6.0, QDError cannot be used for non-Color<br>
QuickDraw Macintosh systems. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>Why do some CopyBits transfer modes produce different results for System 7.0 than</i><br>
<i>for System 6.0?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Under System 6.0, the srcOr, srcXor, srcBic, notSrcCopy, notSrcOr, notSrcXor, and<br>
notSrcBic transfer modes do not produce the same effect for a 16- or 32-bit (direct)<br>
pixel map as for an 8-bit or shallower (indexed) pixel map. With Color QuickDraw<br>
these classic transfer modes on direct pixel maps aren't color based; they're pixel<br>
value based. Color QuickDraw performs logical operations&nbsp;&nbsp;corresponding to the<br>
transfer mode on the source and destination pixel values to get the resulting pixel<br>
value.For example, say that a multicolored source is being copied onto a black&nbsp;&nbsp;and<br>
white destination using the srcOr transfer mode, and both the source&nbsp;&nbsp;and destination<br>
are 8 bits per pixel. Except in unusual cases, the pixel value for black on an indexed<br>
pixel map has all its bits set, so an 8-bit black pixel has a pixel value of $FF.<br>
Similarly, the pixel value for white has all its bits clear, so an 8-bit white pixel has<br>
a pixel value of $00. CopyBits takes each pixel value of the source and performs a<br>
logical OR with the corresponding pixel value of the destination. Using OR to combine<br>
any value with 0 results in the original value, so any pixel value ORed with the pixel<br>
value for white results in the original pixel value. Using OR to combine any value with<br>
1 results in 1, so any pixel value ORed with the pixel value for black results in the<br>
pixel value for black. The resulting image shows the original image in all areas where<br>
the destination image was white and shows black in all areas where the destination<br>
image was black.
</p>
<p>
Take the same example, but this time make the source and destination 32 bits per<br>
pixel. The direct- color pixel value for black is $00000000 and the direct-color<br>
pixel value for white is $00FFFFFF. CopyBits still performs a logical OR on the source<br>
and destination pixel values, but notice what happens in this case. Using OR to combine<br>
any source pixel value with the pixel value for white results in white, and using OR to<br>
combine any source pixel value with the pixel value for black results in the original<br>
color.&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting image shows the original image in all areas where the destination<br>
image was black and shows white in all areas where the destination image was<br>
white--roughly the opposite of what you see on an indexed pixel map. 
</p>
<p>
The newer transfer modes addOver, addPin, subOver, subPin, adMax, and adMin work<br>
consistently at all pixel depths, and often, though not always, correspond to the<br>
theoretical effect of the old transfer modes. For example, the adMin mode works<br>
similarly to the srcOr mode on both direct and indexed pixel maps. Also, 1-bit deep<br>
source pixel maps work consistently and predictably regardless of the pixel depth of<br>
the destination even with the old transfer modes.
</p>
<p>
Under System Software 7.0, the old transfer modes now perform by calculating with<br>
colors rather than pixel values. You'll find that transfer modes like srcOr and srcBic<br>
work much more consistently even on&nbsp;&nbsp;direct pixel maps.

<b>Q </b><i>Is the Macintosh printing architecture different for System 7.0? </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>No changes were made to the printing architecture for System 7.0. Printer drivers<br>
were revised for System 7.0 to support TrueType, to be completely 32-bit clean, and<br>
to fix bugs, but the printing architecture remains the same for System 7.0.</p><p><b>Q</b>
<i>BitMapToRegion does not work as described in Technical Note #275 for a PixMap with</i><br>
<i>baseAddr = (NuBus address). Which calls support PixMap 32-bit base addressing</i><br>
<i>with pmVersion = 4? </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>As of System 7.0&amp;szlig;1, BitMapToRgn cannot handle a bitmap whose base address<br>
is in the NuBus TMaddress space or any bitmap that requires 32-bit addressing. The<br>
problem will be fixed for System 7.0's final release. As far as&nbsp;&nbsp;we know, BitMapToRgn<br>
is the only&nbsp;&nbsp;call that doesn't yet support 32-bit addressed bitmaps.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q </b><i>Can the LaserWriter 7.x driver be used with System 6.0?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A </b>Yes! LaserWriter 7.x is compatible with both System 7.0 and System 6.0. It's still<br>
prerelease software, however. Do not ship the preliminary LaserWriter 7.x driver<br>
with your application.&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll be able to ship the final LaserWriter 7 driver with your<br>
product as soon as System 7.0 is final. To use the new LaserWriter driver with an<br>
AppleShare print spooler, you need a special LaserPrep, available on developer CDs<br>
and on AppleLink.
