Once upon a time, in an engineering department far, far away, the great implementors<br>
(GIs) ran across a problem with their Frankensteinian monster. They had designed and<br>
built a powerful beast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beast that had traveled great distances into unknown<br>
territories, and that had cut many new paths in the hot lead jungle. Many spoke of the<br>
creation, and it had become well known and respected in many lands and platforms. But<br>
the complexity that only the great implementors had dared to conceive was being<br>
challenged by the great hackers of the land. Many of them had conquered the secrets of<br>
the beast, and shared the knowledge of the great implementors. Soon, even mortal<br>
hackers would be able to control the beast. This would not do. . . 
</p>
<p>
The GIs traveled far to find the infamous "field workers." They had already given the<br>
GIs the gift of dynamic, incomprehensible data structures, and the GIs were hopeful<br>
that they could provide something more. They could not. . .
</p>
<p>
At last, on their return from the field, they ran across a court jester. Like all good<br>
jesters, he was trying hard to find some fun. He tried to get the GIs to play a game with<br>
him. He tried Monopoly, Pictionary, even checkers, but the GIs were not interested<br>
(he did notice a little glimmer when he mentioned thermonuclear war, but not enough<br>
to be important). As a last resort, he finally said, "Pick a number." Suddenly, the<br>
great gods of arbitration came down on the GIs like a 5-ton weight. "Pick a number!"<br>
one of them shouted. "It's beautiful!" laughed another one. And soon they were off to the<br>
lab to implement their new discovery.

This folks, is the not-based-on-a-true-story story of the constant named <code>iPfMaxPgs</code>.<br>
This constant is part of the Printing Manager, and limits the number of pages that can<br>
be spooled (that is, written to disk) in one print job. In the old days, when even<br>
engineers at Apple were using floppy drives, the Print Shop came to the conclusion<br>
that there should be a limit on the number of pages&nbsp;&nbsp;you could print in a single job. If<br>
not, the user could easily use up all the disk space on the boot disk, which at the time,<br>
led to other, even more interesting problems. The decision to limit the number of<br>
pages was quickly followed by a decision to use the court jester's advice and "pick a<br>
number." The magic number is 128, and is referenced by the constant <code>iPfMaxPgs</code>.
</p>
<p>
So now, you are printing your favorite report, all 130 pages of it, and just to annoy<br>
your neighbors, you're printing to your ImageWriter II in Best mode. You've placed<br>
the printer next to the window in the bathroom where the acoustics&nbsp;&nbsp;are especially<br>
outgoing, and the window is open for the extra cooling effect (at least, that's what you<br>
told the neighbors). As the head rips across the bottom of page 128 like nails across<br>
the chalkboard, you are suddenly greeted with a Printing Manager error code. Sure,<br>
your neighbors are happy, but you still have two pages to go. You frantically dig for<br>
that suicide prevention number (that your neighbors have obviously borrowed), but<br>
decide instead that printing more than 128 pages in one job would be a great way to get<br>
new neighbors.
</p>
<p>
To print jobs longer than 128 pages, you simply treat them like multiple jobs,<br>
printing each set of 128 pages just like the first set. To make this even simpler, it<br>
would be nice if there was one line of code that told you when to close the current<br>
document and open the new one. Welcome to the MOD squad (or the % Club for you C<br>
dudes).
</p>
<p>
The MOD instruction is very useful for tracking sets of things, like the number of<br>
pages in a print job. Most people that have implemented a Macintosh printing loop<br>
(you can spot them by the gray hair and growing forehead) use some kind of page loop.
</p>
<p>
The following code fragments will show the flow of control using the MOD operator. The<br>
parameters of the Toolbox routines have been omitted for simplicity. 
</p>
<p>
Before you knew enough words to type 128-page documents, you used to have a print<br>
loop that figured out how many pages you had to print and then printed them one at a<br>
time.
</p>
<p>
This works well for bothering neighbors, but you'll never get any For Sale signs with<br>
this technique. To print jobs larger than 128 pages, you need to call <br>
<code>PrOpenDoc/PrCloseDoc</code>within the FOR loop.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever you reach 128 pages, you<br>
need to call <code> PrCloseDoc </code>to close the current document, and then<code> PrPicFile </code>to<br>
despool the (now full) spool file. Once this is done, a new document is opened, and<br>
everything continues as before.
</p>
<pre>FOR pageIndex := firstPage TO kNumberOfPages - 1 DO
BEGIN
    (* If we are on page number 128,
       we need to close and reopen the document *)
    IF (pageIndex - firstPage) MOD iPFMaxPgs = 0 THEN
    BEGIN
        (* Make sure there is a document open before
           calling PrCloseDoc! i.e. if this is the first
           page, don't call PrCloseDoc... *)
        IF pageIndex &lt;&gt; firstPage THEN
        BEGIN
            PrCloseDoc(...);
            PrPicFile(...);
        END;
        (* Now open a fresh, 128 page spool file. *)
        PrOpenDoc(...);
    END;
    (* Call PrOpenPage/PrClosePage for each page of the document. *)
    PrOpenPage(...);
    PrintAPage(...);
    PrClosePage(...);
END;
(* Finally, close the document and despool the spool file.*)
PrCloseDoc(...);
PrPicFile(...);
.

<p>
Pretty straightforward, but you'd be surprised how many developers the great<br>
implementors have caught with this one. Using the above method, you can safely print<br>
large documents on any device, without having to worry about overflowing the spool<br>
file. As for your neighbors, you could always put a Pause/Continue button in your<br>
Printing Status dialog, but then, where's the fun in that?
