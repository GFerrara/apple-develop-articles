&nbsp;I just learned about a technique for graphically representing points in n-dimensional<br>
space, first presented in 1973 (I guess I'm a little behind) by a Harvard statistician,<br>
H. Chernoff. Representing points in two or three dimensions is pretty straightforward,<br>
but what about data points in, say, ten dimensions? Chernoff's approach was to use<br>
cartoon faces, with each dimensional parameter determining a facial feature. One<br>
parameter determines eye size, for instance; another regulates eyebrow slant, another<br>
determines the position of the mouth, and so on. I was struck dumb by the power of the<br>
idea. Humans have a built-in feature integration and recognition ability that lets us<br>
intuitively track and correlate changing facial features with no conscious effort, and<br>
Chernoff's technique elegantly capitalizes on this ability.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The possible uses for these "Chernoff faces" are many and varied. In his book <br>
<i>Computers, Pattern, Chaos, and Beauty</i> , Clifford Pickover talks about a number of<br>
possible applications: the elucidation of high-level statistical concepts, uses in air<br>
traffic control and aircraft piloting, educational applications, and many more. In one<br>
particularly illuminating example he uses the faces to characterize sound. He runs the<br>
sound data through an auto-correlation function (for the gory details, see his book)<br>
and then uses the first ten points of the resulting data set to control the faces. As<br>
examples heshows the faces generated by the sounds <i> s</i> , <i>sh</i> , <i>z</i> ,&nbsp;&nbsp;and <i>v</i> , sounds which<br>
are very similar. The resulting faces, though, are easily and immediately<br>
distinguishable. As Pickover points out, this correlation between sounds and<br>
appearance of the faces immediately suggests the possibility of using the faces as<br>
feedback devices for helping severely hearing-impaired people to modify their<br>
vocalizations. To learn a particular sound, they would try to produce the same Chernoff<br>
face as that produced by a hearing person vocalizing the sound.
</p>
<p>
There are a few things worth noting about these faces. First of all, children respond<br>
just as well as adults to the faces. Since facial recognition capabilities develop in<br>
infancy, that's really not surprising, but it does mean that the faces have very broad<br>
application possibilities. I'd also bet that they're freer of cultural bias than many<br>
interface elements, which broadens their possible uses even more. Second, the faces<br>
probably aren't appropriate for quantitative analysis; if you need to get the exact value<br>
of a parameter, use a gauge. But they're great for high-level cognitive discrimination,<br>
especially for tracking qualitative changes in multiple variables through time. Third,<br>
because they're human faces, they could contain emotional connotations that have<br>
nothing whatever to do with the data they represent. Imagine a face used to track water<br>
levels and pump pressures in a nuclear power plant getting happier and happier as the<br>
plant approaches meltdown. Time for some facial calibration, I'd say.
</p>
<p>
Included on the <i> Developer Essentials</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;CD is my version of Pickover's face routine. It<br>
takes as arguments a pointer to a rect and a pointer to an array of 10 bytes, and it<br>
draws the resulting face in the current port, scaled to the rect. See the code for more<br>
details. One really cool thing is that if ten dimensions aren't enough, you can simply<br>
add more detail to the picture: hair maybe, or ears. The hardest part is coming up with<br>
meaningful 10-D data.
</p>
<p>
What's really interesting is how this technique and others like it capitalize on the kind<br>
of processing that we already do automatically: you don't have to learn to discriminate<br>
faces; you already know how, and you do it without even trying. So even while some<br>
part of your brain is busily integrating facial features, your conscious mind is still<br>
free to deal with other, higher-level tasks. All the best interfaces do this to some<br>
degree, by simulating some part of what we call reality. (For instance, everyone's<br>
favorite desktop model simulates a flat, bounded environment with overlapping two-<br>
dimensional areas, something we're very familiar with in the real world through our<br>
interactions with tabletops and paper.) A convincing simulation, or even one that<br>
captures essential parts of the reality (like the Macintosh desktop), is an incredibly<br>
powerful thing.
</p>
<p>
Human interfaces (so far humans are the predominant, market-driving users of<br>
computers) can take advantage of many things: our ability to maintain internal mental<br>
maps, our built-in image processing, our kinesthetic awareness of space, and so on.<br>
All these things have been finely tuned by a zillion years of evolution, so why not use<br>
them? Effective human interfaces are overwhelmingly visual and tactile, precisely<br>
because vision and touch are the primary senses we use to interact with the world we<br>
know so well. (For a dog I suppose a good interface would have to be heavily auditory<br>
and olfactory:
</p>
<p>
sniff a file to get info; when something you search for is found, it whines so you can<br>
locate it; system errors smell like flea shampoo.)
</p>
<p>
New interfaces are trying to capitalize even further on what we already know how to<br>
do. Xerox PARC's latest experimental interface, the Information Visualizer, uses 3-D<br>
real-time animation and represents information as directly manipulable 3-D objects.<br>
You can "pick up" a data structure and look at it from all angles, using your built-in<br>
spatial skills to help make sense of large bodies of information. PenPoint, Go<br>
Corporation's recently announced pen-based operating system, takes advantage of,<br>
among other things, our familiarity with pencils and notebooks. (I guess it's not recent<br>
anymore, is it? It's still February in here.)
</p>
<p>
The goal of an interface is to make using the computer easier and more intuitive. What<br>
more direct way than to simulate on the computer things that people already know how<br>
to work with? A really interesting question is whether simulation is a necessary part<br>
of a good interface, but it's a question without an answer yet, at least as far as I know.<br>
In the meantime, while you're programming your next whiz-bang interface,<br>
remember to occasionally look beyond the next crash or whether you remembered to<br>
unlock that handle. There are many, many things that all people are already good at:<br>
take advantage of them.

<b>DAVE JOHNSON</b>, our technical buckstopper, has been with Apple for three years.<br>
Before becoming an official stopper-of- the-buck, he worked on PostScript printers<br>
in Apple's software testing group. His interest in computers dates back to his college<br>
days at Humboldt State University, where he majored in energy systems engineering,<br>
and minored in everything else he could think of (it was a seven-year stay). He's also<br>
our resident juggler, who will juggle anything or anybody--and has. Actually, Dave<br>
has always been a show-biz kind of guy; as a kid, he was into monster makeup, which<br>
led him to monster-making and puppeteering at Lucasfilm's Industrial Light and<br>
Magic. (You've seen his work in such flicks as<i>Spaceballs</i> ,<i> The Witches of Eastwick</i> ,<br>
and <i>Inner Space</i> ; he was also an On-Set Duck Mechanic for <i> Howard the Duck</i> .) When<br>
not buckstopping and juggling, he programs the Macintosh (screen savers, gratuitous<br>
fractal programs, artificial life simulations: nothing useful), hangs out with his wife<br>
and dogs,&nbsp;&nbsp;reads as much as possible, and pushes all available limits, both real and<br>
imagined.<b>*</b>
