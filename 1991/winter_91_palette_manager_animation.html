<h2>PALETTE MANAGER ANIMATION</h2>
<h1>RICH COLLYER</h1>
<p>
<i>In the last several weeks many of you have asked "How do I animate colors with the</i><br>
<i>Color Manager?" I usually answer, "The Color Manager is not a good way to animate</i><br>
<i>colors. Try the Palette Manager instead." I figure that for every person who asks this</i><br>
<i>question there are a hundred others out there trying to figure out the answer by</i><br>
<i>themselves. This article is for all of you independent types who never ask questions</i><br>
<i>but could use the answer just the same.</i>
</p>
<p>
This article comes with a sample: GiMeDaPalette. The article shows how to do color<br>
table animation by using the Palette Manager, and by the end of the article&nbsp;&nbsp;I think<br>
you'll be convinced that using the Palette Manager is the only way to fly.
</p>
<p>
To see the animation effect, you will need to run the sample on a monitor (device) that<br>
uses a color look-up table, often called a clutType device; you need a color&nbsp;&nbsp;look-up<br>
table to do color table animation.
</p>
<p>
The sample is designed to run only under System 6.0.5 or greater, or when&nbsp;&nbsp;32-Bit<br>
QuickDraw is installed; the Palette Manager shows its abilities best in these<br>
environments. This limitation may discourage those who want their applications to<br>
work on all systems and hardware configurations, but remember that if you stick to<br>
32-Bit QuickDraw or 6.0.5, you'll be able to take advantage of the upgrades and<br>
improvements that Apple provides. If you don't, your application is likely to stagnate.<br>
One possible way to work around this dilemma is to separate your code into a<br>
pre-32-Bit QuickDraw version and a 32-Bit QuickDraw version. This will make your<br>
application more complex, but it will give you the flexibility to work under most, if<br>
not all, color systems.
</p>
<p>
When you run the sample application, you will find that there is a File menu, which<br>
just allows you to quit, and a Palette menu that allows you to pick the color usage of <br>
the palette. The sample initializes itself to use a palette with the color usage Courteous.
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When you want to animate the palette, you will want to select one of the menus that<br>
contains the word animated. (Animated, Tolerant + Animated, Explicit + Animated,<br>
Tolerant + Explicit + Animated).
</p>
<h2>A LOOK AT THE SAMPLE</h2>
<p>
The three major parts of the sample:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Setting up the color environment</li>
<li> Picking a color for drawing</li>
<li> Animating the colors will be needed in most applications that require<br>
color table animation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>SETTING UP THE COLOR ENVIRONMENT</b><br>
The four main lines of code that I used to set up the environment in GiMeDaPalette are
</p>
<pre>mycolors = GetCTable(clutID);

(*mycolors)-&gt;ctFlags |= 0x4000;

srcPalette = NewPalette(numcolor, mycolors, pmCourteous, 0);

SetInhibited(pmCourteous);</pre>
<p>
Since this sample is a more general use of the Palette Manager, I started by building a<br>
palette that is Courteous. This means that you get what colors the system can give you<br>
with the best matches it can make, but the Palette Manager is not going to
</p>
<p>
change any of the colors in the environment to give you what you want. The&nbsp;&nbsp;palette is<br>
built with a color table that is stored as a resource and retrieved with the trap call<br>
to<code>GetCTable</code>. The manipulation to the<code> ctFlags </code>is described in a sidebar, "Other<br>
Features of the Palette Manager," later in this article; basically the manipulation<br>
makes it possible to use the colors in an offscreen world. The palette has 256 colors<br>
(<code>numcolor </code>= 256) and the tolerance is set to zero. The tolerance value tells the<br>
Palette Manager how close the color match needs to be, but unless you have the usage<br>
set to<code> pmTolerant</code>, it is ignored. For more information on these calls, see the Palette<br>
Manager chapters in<i> Inside Macintosh </i> (volume V, chapter 7, and volume VI, chapter<br>
20). My function<code> SetInhibited</code>, is described in the sidebar, "Other Features of the<br>
Palette Manager." I used it to set the palette usage so that the palette will be good for<br>
any pixel depth that the window may end up on.
</p>
<p>
After setting up the palette, you attach it to the window:
</p>
<pre>SetPalette ((WindowPtr) myWindow, srcPalette, TRUE);</pre>
<p>
If you want more control over when the window gets its updates, you would want to<br>
use<code>NSetPalette </code>instead of<code> SetPalette</code>.<code> NSetPalette </code>allows you to specify<br>
whether you want the updates to happen only when the window is in the background,<br>
only when it is in the foreground, always, or never.
</p>
<p>
The simplest way of using palettes is to store them as resources of type<code> 'pltt'</code>.<br>
When<code>GetNewCWindow </code>is called the system looks for a<code> 'pltt' </code>resource with the same<br>
ID as the window being opened. If it is found, the palette is loaded and attached to the<br>
window. It is also possible to have a palette that is used for all the windows an<br>
application may open; in this case when<code>NewCWindow </code>or<code> GetNewCWindow </code>is called<br>
(and no<code> 'pltt' </code>with the same ID is found) the<code>'pltt' </code>with ID = 0 is used.
</p>
<p>
When you select one of the Animated menus, the code calls<code> SetInhibited </code>and passes<br>
the function a usage of<code> pmAnimated</code>. The function then sets up the palette to have the<br>
new usage and makes the palette available for animation.
</p>
<p>
<b>PICKING A COLOR FOR DRAWING</b><br>
In GiMeDaPalette I don't have to pick a color to draw with. If you want to do any<br>
drawing in your application, other than calling<code> CopyBits</code>, you call the trap<br>
<code>PmForeColor </code>to select a color to draw with and then just draw.
</p>
<p>
<b>ANIMATING COLORS</b><br>
Once you select one of the Animated menus, GiMeDaPalette requires only four lines of<br>
code toanimate colors. First you save the first color in the palette:
</p>
<pre>GetEntryColor(srcPalette, 1, &amp;changecolor);</pre>
<p>
Then you cycle the colors 2 to 254:
</p>
<pre>AnimatePalette(myWindow, StoreCTab, 2, 1, numcolor - 2);</pre>
<p>
Next you move the saved color to the last entry :
</p>
<pre>AnimateEntry(myWindow, numcolor - 1, &amp;changecolor);</pre>
<p>
Finally you save the new version of the palette into the color table for use during the<br>
next animation:
</p>
<pre>Palette2CTab(srcPalette, StoreCTab);</pre>
<p>
The sample does not animate the entire palette, because the Palette Manager will not<br>
let you animate white (entry 0) and black (entry 255).
</p>
<p>
<b>USING THE COLOR MANAGER</b><br>
All of this can be done with the Color Manager, but to do it and get the same<br>
functionality, you will need to generate considerably more code. The main problem<br>
with the Color Manager is that it does not provide automatic support for multiple<br>
monitors, color arbitration, compatibility with other applications, and several other<br>
features that are basic to any real color application.
</p>
<h2>OTHER AUTOMATIC FEATURES OF THE PALETTE MANAGER</h2>
<p>
<b>KEEP IT SIMPLE</b><br>
The Palette Manager takes care of several details for you, and the result is a simpler,<br>
more elegant application. It also provides more compatibility; that is, it helps ensure<br>
that the application will work under GC QuickDraw and will be friendly under<br>
MultiFinder.
</p>
<p>
<b>TAKE CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT</b><br>
Like a good citizen in a community, an application must take care of its environment. If<br>
applications have no concern for their environments, users will constantly need to<br>
reboot their machines to get back to stable ground. The Palette Manager provides this<br>
support without extra code.
</p>
<p>
<b>Background.</b> One of the differences between the Color Manager and the Palette<br>
Manager is that the Color Manager usually animates the background and the Palette<br>
Manager tries not to. The Palette Manager reserves the colors so that no other<br>
applications can use them. This means that when the colors are animated, only the<br>
foreground animates, if possible. In general the Palette Manager tries to make sure<br>
that the colors your application is using will not make a mess of other applications<br>
that are running at the same time.
</p>
<p>
<b>Reserve entries. </b>You can reserve the colors with the Color Manager by using<br>
<code>ReserveEntry</code>, but if you do, you can no longer use<code> Index2Color </code>to get the colors<br>
you need. But even if you get around that problem, you still cannot call<code> RGBForeColor</code><br>
to set the color; you need to change the graphics port directly, and we all know what a <br>
<i>bad </i> idea this is. Once again the Palette Manager is cleaner, because it does not force<br>
your application to manipulate the graphics port.
</p>
<p>
<b>MultiFinder switch. </b>The Palette Manager cleans up when you are switched out in<br>
MultiFinder. If another application that uses a different color environment is running<br>
at the same time as yours, it gets the colors it wants when it is the frontmost<br>
application, and you get the colors you want when you are the frontmost application.<br>
The Color Manager does not do this for you; you must do the work yourself.
</p>
<p>
<b>Multiple monitors.</b> The Palette Manager will work over multiple monitors, while<br>
the Color Manager does not. If you wish to run your application on multiple monitors,<br>
and you are using the Color Manager, you will have to worry about what monitors your<br>
windows span and make sure that<code>SetEntries </code>is called for each monitor. This can get<br>
really cumbersome.
</p>
<p>
<b>GIVE ME SPEED</b><br>
Generally you would expect the Color Manager to run faster, since the<br>
<code>AnimatePalette </code>trap ultimately calls<code> SetEntries</code>. However, the Palette Manager is<br>
just as fast as the Color Manager. And don't forget that while the Palette Manager is<br>
just as fast as the Color Manager, it is also providing the support for all of its cool<br>
features; the Color Manager provides none of this support.
</p>
<h2>USE THE PALETTE MANAGER</h2>
<p>
I hope that I have convinced you that the Palette Manager is considerably better at<br>
color table animation than the Color Manager. Let's go over the highlights:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The Palette Manager makes your application more compatible with GC    <br>
QuickDraw and MultiFinder. The Color Manager does not do this for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li> The Palette Manager protects your application from making a mess of the<br>
color&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;environment by not letting it animate black and white. With the Color<br>
Manager&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have to protect yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li> The Palette Manager arbitrates the colors in the color environment for<br>
you. This&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means that you don't have to worry about your window getting the<br>
colors it needs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when it is the frontmost window. Color Manager does not do<br>
this for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li> The Palette Manager takes care of multiple monitor support for you.<br>
Multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monitor support comes free with the Palette Manager; there are no<br>
freebies in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li> The Palette Manager can cleanly reserve the entries that you wish to<br>
animate; there is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no clean way to do this with the Color Manager. </li>
</ul>

If this has convinced you that the Palette Manager is the way to go, I think you've taken<br>
a big step toward making the next great color application that Mac users around the<br>
world will love.
</p>
<p>
<b>PALETTE MANAGER HISTORY</b>
</p>
<p>
1987 - The Palette Manager arrived on the scene late in the development of the<br>
original Macintosh II. The engineer who was responsible for the Palette Manager was<br>
given only a few weeks to produce it. Under the circumstances, it's amazing that the<br>
Palette Manager worked at all.
</p>
<p>
1988 - System 6.0.2 shipped with a new version of the Palette Manager that was<br>
much closer to the way it was supposed to work, but it still didn't do all that people<br>
wanted it to.
</p>
<p>
1989 - The first version of 32-Bit QuickDraw included a lot of big changes and<br>
improvements to the Palette Manager. There were still a few problems, but the Palette<br>
Manager was finally able to do what people really wanted it to.
</p>
<p>
1990 - The 32-Bit QuickDraw version of the Palette Manager was made part of the<br>
system software in 6.0.5. The last of the major problems were ironed out, and the new<br>
Palette Manager was available to everyone who ran system 6.0.5 or greater, with or<br>
without 32-Bit QuickDraw.
</p>
<h2>GetEntries: ONE OF THE GOTCHAS IN THE COLOR MANAGER</h2>
<p>
Some people think they can call<code> GetEntries </code>to save the current color table and later<br>
rebuild the color table with<code>SetEntries</code>. Unfortunately, <code>GetEntries </code>and<br>
<code>SetEntries </code>do not work well together.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time you call<code> GetEntries </code>and follow it<br>
with <code>SetEntries</code>, the color table will get a little lighter. What happens is that when<br>
you call <code> SetEntries</code>, the colors are gamma corrected and<code> GetEntries </code>does not<br>
reverse this effect. So each gamma correction causes the color table to get lighter. For<br>
more information about gamma correction take a look at "Designing Cards and Drivers<br>
for the Macintosh Family."
</p>

<p>
<b>OTHER FEATURES OF THE PALETTE MANAGER</b>
</p>
<p>
<code>ctFlags</code><b> BIT 14</b>If you would like to use an offscreen world and to animate the images<br>
that you create, this is the bit for you. If you
</p>
<ul>
<li>set bit 14 of the<code> ctFlags </code>field in your color table    </li>
<li>use this color table to pick your colors when drawing in the offscreen<br>
world&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>set the usage of your palette to<code> pmAnimated + pmExplicit </code>and then call<br>
<code>CopyBits or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DrawPicture</code>; the colors will map correctly and the image<br>
will animate. This feature allows an offscreen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world full access to the color<br>
table via the index values. If you do not follow these three steps, you will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get<br>
only a black-and-white image out of the<code> DrawPicture </code>or<code> CopyBits</code>. I have<br>
included this feature&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the sample GiMeDaPalette. The code below is just<br>
clippings from the sample itself.</li>
</ul>
<pre>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
mycolors = GetCTable (clutID);
(*mycolors)-&gt;ctFlags |= 0x4000;
...
srcPalette = NewPalette (numcolor, mycolors,
             pmAnimated + pmExplicit, 0);
...
err = NewGWorld (&amp;offscreenGWorld, 8, &amp;WinMinusScroll,
      mycolors, nil, nil);
...
DrawPicture (ThePict, &amp;WinMinusScroll);</pre>
<p>
<code>pmAnimated+pmExplicit</code> This is one of the really cool features of the Palette<br>
Manager. Generally when you build a palette, the color matching will just put the<br>
colors where they fit best, but when you have a usage of explicit, the colors are placed<br>
in the exact index locations in which you want them. This is important because you<br>
can't set a palette to an offscreen world, and you generally want to be able to draw off<br>
screen first and then copy to the screen. This is a problem because you still need<br>
access to the palette colors. But you can achieve this access by building the palette in<br>
such a way that you know the colors are at the exact index values you havespecified in<br>
your color table.&nbsp;&nbsp;This feature in conjunction with the<code> ctFlags </code>bit 14 feature will<br>
give you the access you need in your offsceen world. For more information about this<br>
feature take a look at the Palette Manager chapter in <i>Inside Macintosh</i> , volume VI<br>
(chapter 20).
</p>
<p>
<code>pmInhibit</code> This usage option is yet another cool feature of the Palette Manager. It<br>
allows the application to specify which colors are to show up on which monitors. So if<br>
you have a palette of 256 colors, but the window is on a 4 bit/pixel screen, you'll get<br>
the 16 of the 256 colors that are labeled as<code> pmInhibitC2</code>. In my sample the function,<br>
<code>SetInhibited</code>, sets the first two colors to always show. The next 12 entries will be<br>
available only if the window is on a screen that is set to 4 or 8 bits/pixel. The rest of<br>
the colors will be available only if the window is on an 8 bit/pixel screen. You can also<br>
set the palette to consider whether the window is on a gray scale screen or not. For<br>
more information about this feature take a look at the Palette Manager chapter in<br>
<i>Inside Macintosh</i> , volume VI (chapter 20) and the sample code.
</p>
<p>
<b>INTERRUPTS</b><br>
You may have noticed that a call to <code> AnimatePalette </code>or <code>SetEntries </code>turns&nbsp;&nbsp;off<br>
interrupts. All Apple video cards, and most third-party video cards, turn off<br>
interrupts until&nbsp;&nbsp;the next VBL (vertical bLanking interrupt) when <code>SetEntries </code> is<br>
called. This generates a cleaner, smoother color animation, but it is a real headache for<br>
anyone who wants to animate colors and at the same time take in data on the serial lines<br>
or play a sound. Any kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;interrupt-driven process, which requires a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;of<br>
attention, is not going to work when <code>SetEntries </code> is being called repeatedly. *

<b>RICH COLLYER </b>Eagle Scout/Fractal Hacker, claims there is nothing unusual about<br>
himself. He's done the routine, everyday stuff we all do, such as attending a sacrifice at<br>
a temple in the Himalayas, climbing a 17,500-foot peak (climbing the 20,000-foot<br>
one would have been "unreasonable"), and strolling the byways of Katmandu and<br>
Bhutan. His adventurous tendencies led him to pursue a physics degree from Cal Poly<br>
with a specialty in computational fluid dynamics, and routinely compels him to climb<br>
rocks. He's survived at least three 20-foot falls; outwardly he seems unscathed, but<br>
we have to wonder. He has a distinct penchant toward chaos, named his dog Precious of<br>
Bonshaw, and fosters a burning desire to be a DTS engineer. Nothing unusual.&nbsp;&nbsp;*
