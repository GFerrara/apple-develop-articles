<p>
&nbsp;So here I am in Tucson, Arizona, standing in a dry streambed reeking of sunscreen<br>
with a notebook computer contraption in my hands and a walkie-talkie hooked on my<br>
pants and a squawking headset barely staying on my head, watching people tying white<br>
cotton string from one tree to another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I move my head the headset slips<br>
forward a little more, but my hands are completely filled with this device, a fairly<br>
delicate thing due to the wire and duct tape and Velcro attachments, and I can't find any<br>
place safe to put it down. So I'm trying not to move my head, and I'm trying to look like<br>
an intelligent and purposeful person at the same time. It's hard. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I had written a little piece of the software that's running on the notebook computer,<br>
which is a GRiDPAD (pen-based, small, DOS). There are three others like it scattered<br>
around the canyon I'm in. Each has a tiny wireless modem and a battery stuck to the<br>
back, and each is running a sort of collaborative spreadsheet: data entered in one is<br>
quickly picked up by all the others. I'll call this contraption The Device from now on,<br>
to avoid funny capitalizations. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;This event is an experiment in wireless communication and in collaboration at a<br>
distance. The main participants are a bunch of elementary school kids and their science<br>
teachers. They're here to study the canyon, and are split into four groups, each of<br>
which is being deployed to a different spot to take environmental measurements (pH,<br>
temperature, and so on) and to count species. Each group has one of The Devices, so<br>
once we're set up everybody will be able to see everybody else's data all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Each group also has a walkie-talkie, so they'll be able to talk to one another. We've<br>
just arrived for the very first field trials. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The string people have finished, neatly delineating the area that is our group's<br>
responsibility. The kids energetically begin fooling with thermometers and vials and<br>
yardsticks and--everyone's favorite--sling psychrometers. I finally find a rock flat<br>
enough to put The Device on, just as the headset lets go and slips over my eyes, pulling<br>
the earplug out of my ear. Gathering together the shredded remains of my dignity, I<br>
disentangle the headset from my ears and sunglasses, put it back on my head, and<br>
reinsert the little earplug in my ear. Who designed this thing? It just won't stay put.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Maybe my head is a weird shape, or maybe this headset isn't meant to be used with<br>
sunglasses on. I take off the headset, take off my sunglasses, put the headset back on,<br>
and it's just as bad. Must be my head. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;There are some very large issues that are touched on by this experiment, directly or<br>
indirectly: the implications of wireless communication, the nature of collaboration,<br>
and the nature of communication itself. I'll take a closer look at these issues, with the<br>
assumption up front that the goal is to provide technology that can enable--and<br>
hopefully enhance--collaboration at a distance. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;First of all, what does wirelessness mean exactly? At face value, not much: it means<br>
that the wires are gone. The information flow hasn't changed; it's just using a different<br>
medium to flow in (or on, or around, or whatever). One person involved in this<br>
project compared the advent of wireless communication to taking down the fence<br>
around a herd of captive buffalo. Will they burst from their former confinement,<br>
joyously kicking their heels (I'm not sure if buffalo <i>have</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;heels, but you get the idea)<br>
and searching out new limits to conquer? Or will they not even notice, so used to the<br>
way things were that they can't conceive of anything else? That would be like some<br>
large, unimaginative corporation's vision of wirelessness: the wires vanish, which<br>
saves a little money and hassle setting up the office, but nothing else changes. Clearly<br>
an approach like this is doesn't take advantage of the situation.
</p>
<p>
Wireless communication adds a whole new degree of freedom to human communication,<br>
that of space. It makes communication position-independent, it unsticks people<br>
geographically. This is potentially a far-reaching freedom if high-bandwidth wireless<br>
communication becomes pervasive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many existing institutions--schools, businesses,<br>
and so on--that largely evolved from the need to have a central physical place are now<br>
freed up, just like the buffalo, and have lots of new territory to explore. Maybe there<br>
are other ways of doing things without people's bodies in attendance that we haven't<br>
thought of yet, since we haven't had the opportunity. But will people take advantage of<br>
this new freedom? Or are we too cozy, too entrenched in our old familiar ways to<br>
transcend them? 
</p>
<p>
Periodically pushing my headset back onto my head, I look around: chaos reigns, but<br>
it's a good, busy, productive sort of chaos. The kids are measuring things, counting<br>
plants and birds and spiders, clambering around in the brush, chattering incessantly<br>
on their walkie-talkies, and entering data into The Device; the video crew--ostensibly<br>
documenting the event but mostly invoking Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle--are<br>
running around poking their cameras and microphones at people; the adults are<br>
watching carefully, coordinating when necessary, commenting on the action over their<br>
own walkie-talkie channel.
</p>
<p>
One thing that surprises me about how the kids are relating to The Device is that they<br>
pretty much take it for granted. I guess I expected them either to ignore it or to be<br>
amazed by it, but they seem to just take it in stride, and use it when it's appropriate.<br>
It occurs to me that that's probably the best reaction we could hope for, to see it for<br>
what it is--a tool--and use it accordingly. And yes, by golly, the kids are<br>
collaborating a little. It's hard to tell, though, whether they'd collaborate on their own.<br>
They know that's what the adults are looking for, and every school kid learns early on<br>
to do what they think their teachers want. 
</p>
<p>
What The Device provides very nicely is a kind of shared data space. It's as if each<br>
group has a magic looking glass that lets them all see the same thing, despite being<br>
physically separated. What The Device <i>doesn't</i> provide is a communication channel that<br>
lets them discuss the data with each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walkie-talkies provide that channel,<br>
although in a stilted manner. To collaborate effectively, you really need both kinds of<br>
communication: the communication of data (the shared thing you're collaborating on)<br>
and the communication of instructions (the conversation <i>about</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;the thing you're<br>
collaborating on).
</p>
<p>
One really interesting point (hotly debated in the post-study debriefing) is the<br>
importance of including voice capabilities in new communication/collaboration<br>
hardware. There is no question that voice, or more generally language, is the primary<br>
medium we use to communicate. The debate pivots on whether voice should be provided<br>
de facto in the technology or whether there is some new, as- yet-undiscovered mode of<br>
communication that technology can provide us that would render voice communication<br>
unnecessary, or at least optional. Pretty heady stuff, no? We're talking about a<br>
quantum leap here, a revolutionary change away from the familiar. Using voice <i>only</i><br>
because it's the way we do it now might hinder or prevent our moving forward into the<br>
grand and glorious communication revolution. 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, why should we not provide voice? Voice compression technology is<br>
advancing quickly because of cellular demand. Good-quality voice can be transmitted at<br>
4800 bits per second now, and soon it will be 2400. Those bandwidths are easy and<br>
getting easier and cheaper all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-duplex real-time voice transmission (in<br>
other words, a conversation) also provides a huge degree of familiarity to people, and<br>
it really adds to the feeling of being connected. Isn't that the goal? To be apart but not<br>
to feel apart? Voice alone provides lots of that "in the same space" kind of feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My<br>
thoughts seem to keep circling back to one central question: should we use this radical<br>
new wireless technology to adopt (and then attempt to improve upon) the way people<br>
communicate and collaborate now, or should we throw out all the rules and go for<br>
something really new? If you're interested in selling products today, probably you<br>
want something like the former. If you're a wild- eyed visionary intent on changing<br>
the world, you'll tend toward the latter. And in reality, let's face it, you always end up<br>
with something in between. 
</p>
<p>
In my humble and inexpert opinion, we ought to build from familiarity. I don't really<br>
have any facts or studies to back me up, just personal observations and a strong feeling<br>
that building from existing modes of communication is the most effective way to get<br>
what we want. And I don't think that this method necessarily precludes radical<br>
advances. Look at the Macintosh. Few people would argue against the fact that it was a<br>
radical leap from any other machine. But the very thing that made it radical was its<br>
familiarity, its <i>humanness</i> . Humanness in a machine is extremely powerful, and<br>
extremely attractive to people. 
</p>
<p>
Maybe I just have a soft spot for humans, being one myself, but I tend to give them a<br>
lot of credit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advent of wireless communication does remove a fence, but it is a<br>
fence around people, not buffalo. People explore, it's one of the things they're best at.<br>
They won't stay huddled in the center of the corral for long. And I also believe that<br>
people already know how to collaborate. If you and I are standing next to each other<br>
looking at a piece of paper that we're working on together, we won't have trouble<br>
proceeding. So if we <i>can</i> provide communication tools that are truly transparent, I<br>
think that collaboration will fall out automatically. Now don't get me wrong. I know<br>
that there's plenty of room for improvement in the way people work together, but I<br>
think the communication tools need to be available before we can make much progress<br>
in collaboration. And yeah, I really think we should provide voice, if we can. If there<br>
<i>are</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;better ways to communicate, I suspect it will be quite a while until we find them,<br>
and in the meantime voice is the best we've got and really does make people feel<br>
connected. 
</p>
<p>
It will of course take a while for all these things to come to fruition, but we are<br>
tantalizingly close. I think the best way to proceed is to build what we can right now,<br>
and get it out into the world as quickly as possible. Then, to learn how to make it<br>
better, we should watch very closely what people do with it. This way the tools will<br>
evolve as natural extensions of the people who use them, which seems like a good goal<br>
to me. Maybe if the headset makers had followed this approach . . .

<b>DAVE JOHNSON</b> was born in southern California, but moved elsewhere as a small<br>
boy, so he's never even been on a surfboard and doesn't say "totally" unless he means<br>
it. He did most of his growing up in a suburb of Chicago (and consequently has strong<br>
opinions about pizza and snow shovels), but was dragged kicking and screaming back to<br>
southern California at the age of seventeen. As soon as he could, he left for college at<br>
Humboldt State University, which was as far as he could get from San Bernardino and<br>
still be in the California school system. He and his wife Lisa now make their home in<br>
San Francisco with their two dogs and two cats (which is, incidentally, the legal limit<br>
on animals in a San Francisco household). They're currently looking for a big house<br>
elsewhere. *

<b>The ideas and issues discussed in this column</b> did not arise in a vacuum. I'd<br>
like to acknowledge the others who inspired me to think about these things and<br>
provided the grist for the mill. In particular, thanks are due to Wayne Grant and Rick<br>
Borovoy, who dreamed up this project in the first place and were kind enough to let me<br>
participate and observe. Also, I want to thank everyone who attended the post-study<br>
debriefing meeting: Tyde Richards, Kathy Ringstaff, Brian Reilly, and Rifaat "Rick"<br>
Dayem. It was at that meeting that I really began to see the implications and issues<br>
surrounding wireless communications and communication technology in general.*
