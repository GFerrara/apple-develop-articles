&nbsp;With the release of 32-Bit QuickDraw version 1.0, Apple wanted to find a way to<br>
support color printing on the high-end (albeit black-and-white) LaserWriter&#174; II, as<br>
well as other, third-party devices. So, the great implementors (GIs) created a new<br>
LaserWriter driver--version 6.0. This driver added a new Color/Grayscale button to<br>
the print dialog, allowing users to print their "way cool" color pictures that were<br>
created with 32-Bit QuickDraw. All was happy in the land of Apple's new color model.<br>
But wait! There was a problem lurking on the horizon, a problem called the PostScript<br>
Offending Command Error.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Imagine this scenario: You've just created a cool 32-Bit QuickDraw picture, a true<br>
masterpiece, and all seems to be going well. You decide to print your picture and show<br>
it off to Mom. You choose Print from the File menu; the print dialog appears, and you<br>
click OK. A few minutes pass, and voil&agrave;: a printed page containing your picture.<br>
Life is gooood.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;With this success, you're now dreaming of other pictures that you'll be able to create<br>
and print. You create another cool 32-bit picture. You choose Print from the File<br>
menu; the print dialog appears, and you click OK. A few minutes pass, and this time the<br>
PostScript Offending Command Error dialog appears, looking something like this:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Error: LimitCheck; Offending Command: 080AGOBBLEDEGOOK0B
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;What's this? An offending command? But all you wanted to do was print your color<br>
picture. You were able to print your first picture a few minutes ago. What's going on?<br>
Unfortunately, LaserWriter driver version 6.0 does not reliably print images that are<br>
deeper than 8 bits. We won't bore you with the details: just think of the LaserWriter<br>
driver as a shark, ready to swallow a surfer off the California coast. But instead of the<br>
surfer dude it was expecting, in rushes the surfer dude's surfboard. The LaserWriter<br>
driver chokes on deeper images just as our poor shark chokes on the surfboard; the<br>
driver is ready to receive a particular variable but occasionally receives something<br>
different, and doesn't know what to do with it. The result: the PostScript Offending<br>
Command Error. Life is no longer so good; your dreams are beginning to fade away. But<br>
I can see a solution appearing on the horizon . . .
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Actually, there are three possible solutions: you can use LaserWriter driver version<br>
6.1 (or version 7.0 when it's available); you can depth-convert your image from 32<br>
bits to 8 bits using 32-Bit QuickDraw; or you can use the PostScript &#174; image<br>
operator to generate PostScript code for your image, and send it directly down to the<br>
LaserWriter. Let's look at each solution.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Using LaserWriter driver version 6.1 is the simplest solution. LaserWriter driver<br>
version 6.1 likes data of any depth, no matter when it's sent. So, if you're printing to<br>
LaserWriter driver version 6.1, life is happy when you're printing your 32-bit<br>
images--but how can you be sure that you're using LaserWriter driver version<br>
6.1?You can call PrDrvrVers, which is provided by the Printing Manager to enable<br>
your application to determine which version of a particular printer driver you're<br>
talking to. But there's a minor problem with this call. You don't know if you're talking<br>
to a PostScript LaserWriter or some other device. So, you must dive into the bowels of<br>
the print record for additional information. You need to check the high byte of the wDev<br>
field of the TPrStl record to determine a particular driver and version. But wait! You<br>
thought checking wDev was evil. In this case, using wDev is OK because you're not<br>
checking for particular functionality of a driver, and thereby not making your code<br>
device dependent. If wDev is 3, you know that you're talking to a PostScript<br>
LaserWriter. Non-PostScript LaserWriters (for example, the LaserWriter IIsc) have<br>
a different value for the wDev field. You would then call PrDrvrVers to determine if<br>
you're talking to LaserWriter driver version 6.1. If PrDrvrVers returns 61, you<br>
know that you're using LaserWriter driver version 6.1, and life is good again. If wDev<br>
is 3, and the driver version is less than 61, you're not using LaserWriter driver<br>
version 6.1, so you have a little more work to do: try the next solution.
</p>
<p>
The next possible solution is to use 32-Bit QuickDraw to depth-convert your 32-bit<br>
image to 8 bits by using 32-Bit QuickDraw's GWorld support. You would first create<br>
an 8-bit GWorld containing a grayscale CLUT, and use CopyBits to copy your 32-bit<br>
image into it. You would then use CopyBits to copy the 8-bit image directly into the<br>
printer's grafPort, and voil&agrave;--your image would be printing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach<br>
works with LaserWriter driver version 6.0 and later. 
</p>
<p>
Your final option is to use the PostScript image operator to generate PostScript code<br>
that represents your 32-bit image. This approach is a little more complex than the<br>
32-Bit QuickDraw idea. To send your data down to the LaserWriter, you would need to<br>
use the PostScriptHandle PicComments with the image operator. If you're already<br>
sending PostScript code to the LaserWriter, this is probably the best approach.
</p>
<p>
By the way, if you don't have a copy of LaserWriter driver version 6.1, it's available<br>
on the<i>Developer Essentials</i> disc. If you want to ship this version of the driver with<br>
your application, you should contact Apple Software Licensing for the details. 
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, we have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that we've<br>
fixed the 32-bit image printing problem that was present in LaserWriter driver<br>
versions 6.0, 6.0.1, and 6.0.2. LaserWriter driver version 6.1 will allow you to<br>
print pictures that are 1 bit to 32 bits deep without any problems. The bad news is<br>
that if you want your application to print all depths of pictures with LaserWriter<br>
driver version 6.0, you're going to need to do a little extra work, either depth-<br>
converting your pictures from 32 bits to 8 bits before print time, or using the<br>
PostScript image operator to generate PostScript code for your image. Now that's not<br>
so bad, is it?

<b>PETE "LUKE" ALEXANDER</b> spends much of his Developer Technical Support time<br>
diving deep into the bowels of the Printing Manager, where he never turns up his nose<br>
at a challenge or at odiferous code that needs explaining. Although that kind of diving is<br>
fun, he prefers the balmy blue waters of anyplace (preferably far from computers)<br>
that has both beach and beer close together. If he can't get away from it all on the beach<br>
somewhere, he'll settle for getting above it all in his glider; with Luke, being up in the<br>
air about something takes on a whole new meaning. Fortunately, not everything on the<br>
horizon is blue sky. Luke's looking forward to the cool new printing architecture that<br>
will make his job (and yours) a lot easier. He's preparing for this new architecture<br>
by spending a week sailing around the Caribbean--figuring that he'd better start<br>
getting used to a life of leisure. Until that leisure can become a lifestyle, you can count<br>
on seeing lots from Luke. *
