<h2>Apple II Q&amp;A</h2>
<h1>Apple II DEVELOPER TECHNICAL SUPPORT</h1>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> When I write an Apple II GS TextEdit keyFilter procedure and put its address in my</i><br>
<i>TextEdit control template, I get funny little pieces of garbage drawn on the screen in</i><br>
<i>my TextEdit record, and sometimes TextEdit crashes. Doesn't the keyFilter mechanism</i><br>
<i>work?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> The keyFilter mechanism in TextEdit works, but there's no space for a keyFilter<br>
address in a TextEdit control template. The only filter procedure in the control<br>
template is the <i> generic</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;filter procedure, which does not take the same parameters as<br>
the keyFilter procedure. If you include a filterProc address in a TextEdit control<br>
template, it must be to a generic filter procedure. Generic filter procedures are<br>
defined on pages 49-16 through 49-18 of <i> Apple IIGS Toolbox Reference</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume 3.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;If you want to use TextEdit's keystroke filter, word wrap hook, or word break hook,<br>
you must modify the TERecord directly to put your procedure's address in the<br>
appropriate place.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> While linking my Apple IIGS&#174; application, LinkIIGS does a system death:</i><br>
<i>"ExpressLoad error 1301." What am I doing wrong?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Believe it or not, LinkII GS has dynamic segments. ExpressLoad has the annoying<br>
habit of taking error codes it's not expecting, adding $1100 to them, and calling<br>
SysFailMgr. Why is this habit annoying? Well, it works just fine for what the author<br>
had in mind, which was GS/OS errors (all of the form $00xx), but it causes problems<br>
with Toolbox errors.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;You've probably figured out the rest by now: $1301 - $1100 = $0201 = Memory<br>
Manager "unable to allocate handle" error. ExpressLoad ran out of memory trying to<br>
load a dynamic segment in LinkIIGS.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The best solution is to get more memory. If you can't make enough memory to link it,<br>
you might consider having some of your code in code resources instead of in dynamic<br>
segments in the data fork, to create separate links for those segments and make the big<br>
link even smaller.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> What is the correct procedure for installing system software on an Apple II GS?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Always use the Installer application. The Installer scripts provided by Apple on the<br>
Apple II GS system disks will put everything you need on the startup disk. If you<br>
attempt to install system software without using the Installer, there's a good chance<br>
you'll forget to copy a needed file or delete an obsolete file. Because SCSI hard disk<br>
drivers are not included on System.Disk, you'll need to do the following to install<br>
System 5.0.4 on a hard disk:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Make backup copies of System.Disk and System.Tools, making sure they<br>
keep the same names.</li>
<li> Launch the Installer from System.Tools (backup) and install SCSI Driver<br>
on the backup of System.Disk. The Installer script will delete a couple of fonts<br>
as well as the tutorial folder to make room for the SCSI information on a<br>
3.5-inch disk.</li>
<li> Boot the backup of System.Disk and install System 5.0.4 onto your hard<br>
drive. If you want Shaston 16 and Times 12 fonts, install "Additional Fonts"<br>
last.</li>
</ol>
<p>
&nbsp;The Installer knows how to make the software fit on a floppy disk. It can also update<br>
your system without requiring you to trash your existing System Folder.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Apple IIGS Technical Note #64, Apple IIGS Installer and Installer Scripts, describes<br>
how the Apple IIGS Installer executes Installer script files and how to write Installer<br>
script files.

<b>Q</b><i> In some of my recent work, I've found it necessary to patch the Apple II GS GS/OS</i><br>
<i>vectors in order to monitor OS calls. My patch works without interfering, but it</i><br>
<i>disappears when the user switches to ProDOS 8 and back to GS/OS. I tried</i><br>
<i>unsuccessfully to fix this by using the notification queue, asking GS/OS to notify me</i><br>
<i>when the user was coming back from ProDOS 8. How can I safely and reliably patch</i><br>
<i>GS/OS on a permanent basis?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> You should be able to patch GS/OS<i> &#174;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;with System 5.0.4. Two observations may help:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If you ask for all notification events, you'll get at least one disk-insert<br>
event before you get any restart events, since the device driver for the startup<br>
disk will "fake" a disk insert to get the appropriate disk-switched statuses set<br>
before doing any real work.</li>
<li> Your procedure may not be the first notification procedure called at<br>
restart time. For example, the Resource Manager inserts a procedure so that<br>
it can reopen the system resource file on return from ProDOS<i>&#174;</i></li>
<li> If this mechanism was broken as you say, the Resource Manager's<br>
notification procedure wouldn't work either.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Why does a dialog box without a Cancel button come up from an Apple II GS Loader</i><br>
<i>call when the volume is not on-line?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> The loaders always set the preferences to "dialog, no Cancel button" when trying to<br>
load a dynamic segment indirectly (because you passed control to it). The loaders must<br>
do this because they have no way to report errors. For example, if your code does a<br>
JMP DynSegLabel, the Loader must load the dynamic segment. Should it get an error, it<br>
has no way to report an error and no place to pass control back to if your program does<br>
a JMP and the Loader has no place to return to. In earlier systems, inability to load a<br>
dynamic segment was a fatal system error. Today, the Loader will not give up until you<br>
insert the disk because it has no other choice. However, if you call LoadSegName<br>
yourself, the Loader should not change the preferences; because that's a call, the<br>
Loader can return from it gracefully. Indirect dynamic segment loading doesn't have<br>
that luxury. The current Loader documentation is in the Addison-Wesley version of<br>
<i>GS/OS Reference</i> .
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> What are longStatText2 items, mentioned in the "Dialog Manager" chapter of the </i> <br>
Apple II GS Toolbox Reference?
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> A longStatText2 item is similar to a longStatText item except that the text is drawn<br>
with LETextBox2. A longStatText2 item allows you to embed formatting codes so that<br>
you can change fonts, font styles, sizes, colors, and justification. The longStatText2<br>
capability is built into the Dialog Manager to support formatting flexibility in<br>
standard dialogs. To use longStatText2 items, the Apple IIGS QuickDraw Auxiliary and<br>
Font Manager tools must be started.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Where do I find a current list of the MessageCenter message types that have been</i><br>
<i>registered with DTS?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Message types that are assigned to individual developers are treated confidentially.<br>
We have very few of these, as most developers now use MessageByName to get an<br>
assignment dynamically.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Where do I find technical documentation on the messages written by the Finder to tell</i><br>
<i>an Apple II GS application which files to open as it starts up?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> The only truly public message types are #1 (the files message from the Finder or<br>
other program launchers) and #2 (the desktop pattern message).
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Message type #1 is documented in <i> Apple IIGS Toolbox Reference</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume 2, with the<br>
description of the MessageCenter tool call. The documentation implies that there are<br>
both filenames and full pathnames (such as Standard File returns) in the message,<br>
but, in fact, each Pascal string indicates a totally separate file. Message type #2 is<br>
documented in <i> Apple IIGS Toolbox Reference</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume 3, in the "Window Manager<br>
Update" chapter (page 52-4).
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> How does an Apple II GS New Desk Accessory (NDA) obtain its ID?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Each Apple IIGS NDA has two IDs: a Memory Manager ID and a Menu ID. If you want<br>
the Memory Manager ID, simply call MMStartup from your DA. The NDA ID for the<br>
OpenNDA call can easily be obtained from your menu string. The Desk Manager<br>
replaces the ** of your \H** at the end of your menu string with your Menu ID, which<br>
is also your NDA number. A note of caution: Please be sure you're running in the<br>
16-bit environment before using the NDA ID to call OpenNDA. If you try this while<br>
ProDOS 8 is running, nothing good comes of it!
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> I'm creating an Apple IIGS list control from a resource. How can I update my listRef</i><br>
<i>resource dynamically, if my list grows dynamically?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> To modify the content of a resource and to grow it, load the resource, make any<br>
changes you want to the handle (such as change the data inside or call SetHandleSize to<br>
make it bigger), and then use the MarkResourceChange call to tell the Resource<br>
Manager your resource's content has been changed. The Resource Manager then updates<br>
the contents of your file when you call UpdateResourceFile. The Resource Manager even<br>
recognizes handle size and content changes (actually, it just assumes the contents have<br>
changed).
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Why is there no GS-only version of HyperMover?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> HyperMoverTM is actually implemented as a pair of HyperCard &#174; stacks:<br>
HyperMover.mac, which runs under Macintosh HyperCard and disassembles Macintosh<br>
stacks; and HyperMover.GS, which runs under HyperCard II GS and reassembles the<br>
stacks into HyperCard IIGS stacks. Although there are a few XCMDs to handle tricky<br>
stuff like sounds and paint files, the majority of the work is done by simple HyperTalk<br>
scripts. It may seem like a disadvantage to require two computers to do the translation,<br>
but in fact there are a number of tremendous advantages:
</p>
<ul>
<li> HyperMover doesn't need to know anything about the internal binary<br>
format of stacks. This makes it somewhat immune to stack format changes. For<br>
example, you can convert a Macintosh HyperCard 1.2.5 stack to HyperCard<br>
2.0 format, but HyperMover will still translate it because the HyperCard<br>
program takes care of reading data from the stack.</li>
<li> The interchange format is simple--a file containing a complete textual<br>
description of the stack. After disassembly, you can open and even edit this file<br>
using any text editor (such as MPW or APW), before reassembling the file on<br>
the GS side. This provides an easy way to browse scripts, looking for potential<br>
machine dependencies, and you can actually perform global modifications on<br>
your stack using the find-and-replace capabilities of your text editor.</li>
<li> When small-font painted text is used to label objects, it often shrinks to<br>
unreadability when converted to the Apple IIGS screen resolution. You'll need a<br>
Macintosh to view all the graphics and decide what they're supposed to look<br>
like, before you can redraw them in 16- color Apple IIGS graphics.</li>
<li> You'll also need a Macintosh to perform side-by-side comparisons and<br>
testing of your new stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;Having a Macintosh available is important at <i> all</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;phases of the stack translation<br>
process. You'll find it makes the entire process much smoother.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Which versions of Macintosh HyperCard are compatible with HyperMover?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> The HyperMover stack will execute in the 1.2.5 and 2.0 Macintosh HyperCard<br>
environments. However, stacks that are translated should be either 1.2.5 stacks, or<br>
1.2.5 stacks <i> converted</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;to 2.0 but not <i>modified</i> . There are two reasons for this:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The graphics converters are designed to start from a Macintosh<br>
HyperCard 1.2.5-sized card only, because stacks with other card sizes may<br>
have objects and graphics improperly aligned.</li>
<li> HyperCard IIGS uses a version of the HyperTalk &#174; scripting language<br>
derived from Macintosh HyperCard 1.2.5, so if a stack uses language elements<br>
that were not present in Macintosh HyperCard 1.2.5, it may translate<br>
correctly but report script errors when the script is executed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> How can I perform error trapping in a script?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Normally, most errors interrupt script execution and immediately present a dialog<br>
to the user. Advanced scripters may want to intercept these errors and deal with them<br>
more "aggressively." Two new HyperCard properties, lockErrors and lastError, have<br>
been provided to control error handling:
</p>
<ul>
<li> lockErrors is a Boolean property that has a simple effect: it prevents the<br>
display of errors. The errors, however, are still there, and stop execution of<br>
the current handler.</li>
<li> lastError is a string property that always contains the text of the most<br>
recent error dialog, whether displayed or not. Because errors cause handlers<br>
to terminate, you'll probably wind up checking lastError from an idle<br>
handler.</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;How do you use lockErrors and lastError? To activate an "error catcher" you can use<br>
the following scripts:
</p>
<pre>on CatchErrors errorSource    -- Begin handling errors.
  global gErrorSource
  set the lastError to empty
  set lockErrors to true
  put errorSource into gErrorSource
end CatchErrors
on ClearErrors        -- Handle errors normally.
  global gErrorSource
  set the lastError to empty
  set lockErrors to false
  put empty into gErrorSource
end ClearErrors
on idle               -- Check for error occurrence.
  global gErrorSource
  if gErrorSource is not empty
  then
    -- Error-handling code goes here.
    -- gErrorSource = where in your code the error happened.
    -- The lastError = what the error was.
  end if
  pass idle
end idle</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;If you have a button that does something dangerous, you can surround the dangerous<br>
portions of the handler with
</p>
<pre>on mouseUp
  -- normal error handling out here
  CatchErrors &#8220;dangerous operation #1&#8221;
  -- Do things that might not work.
  ClearErrors
  -- Now we&#8217;re back to normal error handling.
end mouseUp</pre>
