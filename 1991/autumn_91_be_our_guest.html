<h2>GWORLDS AND NUBUS MEMORY</h2>

<p>
In Developer Technical Support, we're asked from time to time how to make a GWorld<br>
so that its pixel image uses memory on a NuBusTM card rather than memory in the<br>
application's heap. The idea is to create a GWorld, put the address of the card into the<br>
GWorld, use QuickDraw to draw into the GWorld, which effectively draws into the<br>
NuBus card's memory, and display the resulting image on the screen. Doing this in a<br>
way that works well with the 8*24 GC version of QuickDraw and with whatever<br>
QuickDraw brews up in the future isn't possible without breaking a few guidelines.<br>
We'll talk about the reasons for this and what you can do instead. For the more cavalier<br>
among you, we'll also talk about the least offensive method of coercing a GWorld so that<br>
it uses memory on your NuBus card. 
</p>
<p>
NewGWorld allocates off-screen buffers simply by using the same Memory Manager<br>
calls that you can make. To allocate the memory, NewGWorld simply calls NewHandle<br>
to allocate the buffer in your application's heap unless you have the useTempMem bit<br>
set, in which case it allocates the buffer in temporary memory. It then tries to move<br>
the buffer as high in your heap as possible by calling MoveHHi. That's really all there<br>
is to it. The GWorld's pixMap, GDevice, and CGrafPort are allocated similarly--<br>
they're all allocated in your heap using regular Memory Manager calls with no special<br>
options, patches, or other nefarious tricks. 
</p>
<p>
None of this changes when you have the 8*24 GC software active--all memory is still<br>
allocated out of your application's heap. Once you start drawing into the GWorld,<br>
though, the GC software can copy the parts of the GWorld to the 8*24 GC memory. The<br>
GWorld and its parts still occupy your heap's memory though, regardless of whether<br>
it's cached on the 8*24 GC card. 
</p>
<p>
If you have a NuBus card with gobs of memory, NewGWorld can't take advantage of it<br>
because the Memory Manager calls that it uses can't allocate memory on NuBus<br>
memory cards. There are no options to NewGWorld or any other GWorld calls that let<br>
you say, "There's lots of memory over on this NuBus card, all for you." While GWorlds<br>
are absolutely fantastic for creating off-screen drawing environments for most of the<br>
usual kinds of situations, they're just not appropriate if you want complete control<br>
over where or how the parts of a GWorld are allocated. 
</p>
<p>
QuickDraw is the only thing that's supposed to know how GWorlds are constructed. We<br>
know that they're CGrafPorts and we can get their pixMap, GDevice, and off-screen<br>
buffer, but we shouldn't make any assumptions about how they were allocated and<br>
where they are. For example, we know that the off-screen buffer is allocated as a<br>
handle now, but that won't necessarily be the case in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no<br>
guaranteed way to tell which way it was allocated, or even if NewGWorld uses the<br>
Memory Manager to allocate it at all (which it always does currently, of course). Even<br>
the GWorld's CGrafPort is allocated as a handle that just happens to be always locked. If<br>
you try to dispose of a GWorld in which you've modified the baseAddr, you'll need<br>
DisposeGWorld to make sure everything is deallocated properly, but its behavior is<br>
undefined when it tries to deallocate the off- screen buffer.&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you want to use the<br>
memory on your NuBus memory card and feel comfortable that you're not relying on<br>
something that could change, you're going to have to create your own off-screen<br>
drawing environment by creating an off-screen pixMap, a color table if your<br>
off-screen drawing environment uses indexed colors, a GDevice, and a CGrafPort. The<br>
April 1989 edition of Macintosh Technical Note #120, "Drawing Into an Off-Screen<br>
Pixel Map," covers creating your own off-screen pixMap, CGrafPort, and color table,<br>
but it requires you to have the same depth and the equivalent color table that the<br>
screen has, so it just steals a screen's GDevice. We think it's always a good idea to<br>
create your own GDevice when you draw off screen. If you use a screen's GDevice for<br>
drawing off screen, you have to depend on that GDevice's depth and color table. By<br>
creating your own GDevice, your off-screen drawing environment can use any depth<br>
and color table you want at any time and still be insulated from whatever changes the<br>
user makes with the Monitors control panel. 
</p>
<p>
To create your own GDevice, it's better not to use NewGDevice because it always<br>
creates the GDevice in the system heap; it's better to keep your data structures in your<br>
own heap so that they don't get orphaned if your application quits unexpectedly and that<br>
precious system heap space is preserved. Here's what you should set each of your<br>
GDevice's fields to be:
</p>
<p><table border="0"><tr><td>gdRefNum</td><td>Your GDevice has no driver, so just set this to 0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>gdID</td><td>It doesn't matter what you set this to; you might as well set it</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>to 0. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdType</td><td>Set to 2 if your off-screen pixMap uses direct colors (16 or</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>32 bits per pixel) or 0 if it uses a color table (1 through 8</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>bits per pixel). </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdITable</td><td>Allocate a small (maybe just 2-byte) handle for this field.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>After you're done setting up this GDevice and your off-screen</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>pixMap, color table (if any), and CGrafPort, set this GDevice</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>as the current GDevice by calling SetGDevice, and then call</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>MakeITable, passing it nil for both the color table and inverse</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>table parameters, and 0 for the preferred inverse table</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>resolution. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdResPref</td><td>We reckon that more than 99.9% of all inverse tables out</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>there have a resolution of 4. Unless you have some reason not</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>to, we'd recommend the same here. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdSearchProc</td><td>Set to nil. Use AddSearch if you want to use a SearchProc. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdCompProc</td><td>Set to nil. Use AddComp if you want to use a CompProc. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdFlags</td><td>Set to 0 initially, and then use SetDeviceAttribute after</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>you've set up the rest of this GDevice. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdPMap</td><td>Set to be a handle to your off-screen pixMap. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdRefCon</td><td>Set to whatever you want. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdNextGD</td><td>Set to nil. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdRect</td><td>Set to be equal to your off-screen pixMap's bounds. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdMode</td><td>Set to -1. Why? We're not sure. This is intended for GDevices</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>with drivers anyway. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdCCBytes</td><td>Set to 0. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdCCDepth</td><td>Set to 0. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdCCXData</td><td>Set to 0. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdCCXMask</td><td>Set to 0. </td></tr>
<tr><td>gdReserved</td><td>Set to 0. </td></tr></table></p>

<p>
For gdFlags, you should use SetDeviceAttribute to set the noDriver bit. You should also<br>
set the gDevType bit to 1 if you're using two bits per pixel or more, but it can be left<br>
at 0 if you're using only one bit per pixel. 
</p>
<p>
The other big difference from the technique shown in Technical Note #120 is that the<br>
off-screen pixel image shouldn't be allocated. Instead, just point the baseAddr field of<br>
your off-screen pixMap at your NuBus card's memory. You should also set the<br>
pmVersion field of your off-screen pixMap to be the constant baseAddr32 (equal to 4).<br>
That tells Color QuickDraw to use 32-bit addressing mode to access your off-screen<br>
buffer, and that's a requirement if your off-screen pixel image is located on a NuBus<br>
card. 
</p>
<p>
When you want to draw into your off-screen pixMap, save the current port with a call<br>
to GetPort and the current GDevice with a call to GetGDevice. Then set the current port<br>
to the off-screen CGrafPort with a call to SetPort, and set the current GDevice to the<br>
off-screen GDevice with a call to SetGDevice. Now all QuickDraw commands are drawn<br>
off screen and the resulting images are in your NuBus card's memory. To switch back<br>
to drawing on screen, set the current port and GDevice back to the port and GDevice<br>
that you saved earlier. Easy! 
</p>
<p>
Even with all this, there might still be a reason to use GWorlds to draw into a NuBus<br>
memory card.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might just want some quick and dirty way to get an off-screen<br>
drawing environment that uses your NuBus memory card and don't care whether it<br>
works with future system software releases or not. We'll talk about that next and also<br>
discuss the issues that you have to be careful about when you do this. 
</p>
<p>
First, create a GWorld using NewGWorld as usual. If you want to, pass it a color table,<br>
or you can just pass it nil if you want it to make the default color table. For the GWorld<br>
flags, make sure you pass only the keepLocal flag. This makes sure that all the pieces<br>
of the GWorld are kept in your own heap rather than being cached into the 8*24 GC<br>
card, even when you draw into it. That way, you avoid running into any conceivable<br>
conflicts with GC QuickDraw over where the GWorld really is.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no way to tell<br>
NewGWorld not to allocate the pixel image, so you might want to make the bounds<br>
rectangle small and then make it bigger later so that your heap isn't hit up for a lot of<br>
memory that you don't even want. Don't pass it an empty rectangle because NewGWorld<br>
just gives you a paramErr in that case. Call GetGWorldDevice to get a handle to your<br>
GWorld's GDevice and save it for later. 
</p>
<p>
Now it's time to have the new GWorld use your NuBus card's memory. The baseAddr of<br>
your GWorld's pixMap is allocated as a handle, and it has to be thrown out. Call<br>
GetPixBaseAddr with a handle to your GWorld's pixMap to get a pointer to the pixel<br>
image that NewGWorld allocated for you. Call RecoverHandle with that pointer to get a<br>
handle to the pixel image, and then call DisposHandle to get rid of it. Now put the<br>
address of your NuBus board into the baseAddr of your GWorld's pixMap. Then set the<br>
pmVersion field of your GWorld's pixMap to the constant baseAddr32. That tells Color<br>
QuickDraw that the baseAddr of the pixMap is a 32-bit address and so it should switch<br>
to 32-bit addressing mode whenever it draws into your GWorld. 
</p>
<p>
If you passed NewGWorld a rectangle that's smaller than you actually want, you can<br>
now set it to the real size. Set the bounds rectangle of your GWorld's pixMap and the<br>
portRect rectangle of your GWorld's CGrafPort to the rectangle that you really wanted.<br>
Also, set the visRgn of the CGrafPort and the gdRect field of your GWorld's GDevice to<br>
that same rectangle. Your GWorld is ready for use! 
</p>
<p>
Now the bad news. Many of the GWorld routines assume that the baseAddr field is<br>
either a real handle or a copy of the handle's master pointer. Because the pointer in the<br>
baseAddr field isn't a master pointer, those routines can crash when they expect one.<br>
Setting the pmVersion field doesn't help in most cases; these routines just assume that<br>
the GWorld's pixel image was allocated by NewGWorld, which is a reasonable<br>
assumption. What this implies is that you can no longer call many of the GWorld<br>
routines to maintain your GWorld without a risk of crashing. When you call SetGWorld<br>
for your GWorld, you should pass it the GWorld's GDevice instead of nil (that's why we<br>
recommended that you save the GWorld's GDevice after calling NewGWorld). For<br>
safety's sake, don't call any of the following:
</p>

<p>
LockPixels<br>
UnlockPixels<br>
AllowPurgePixels<br>
NoPurgePixels<br>
GetPixelsState<br>
SetPixelsState<br>
UpdateGWorld<br>
GetGWorldDevice
</p>
<p>
You can call DisposeGWorld because it won't get hung up trying to deallocate the pixel<br>
image on your NuBus card; setting your pmVersion to baseAddr32 makes this possible.<br>
Of course, since all these GWorld routines are off limits, almost all the benefits of<br>
having a GWorld at all are gone as well. 
</p>
<p>
Another piece of bad news is that this doesn't take advantage of the speed benefits of<br>
using GWorlds with an 8*24 GC card. Most of the speed benefit of using GWorlds with<br>
GC QuickDraw is that the GWorld's pixel image is allocated on the 8*24 GC card itself,<br>
and so the image data doesn't have to take the time to move across NuBus. If your<br>
GWorld draws into a NuBus memory card, the image data has to be moved across<br>
NuBus, and so that speed benefit is gone. 
</p>
<p>
The last bit of bad news is that even if you follow all of this, you're still not guaranteed<br>
that it will still work in future system software or future video card releases. As we<br>
said earlier, this should only be done if you don't care whether it works on future<br>
system software releases or not. The description above breaks a lot of rules: don't<br>
assume that the pixel image is allocated as a handle; don't set the baseAddr of a GWorld;<br>
don't change the dimensions of a GWorld without UpdateGWorld; and don't set the<br>
pmVersion field of a GWorld. 
</p>
<p>
You have your choices when you want to use QuickDraw to draw off screen into the<br>
memory of a NuBus video card. You can be safe for future compatibility by creating<br>
your own off-screen drawing environment from scratch, or you can modify a GWorld<br>
so that it uses your NuBus card's memory at the risk of breaking on future systems<br>
and at the cost of losing most of the benefits of GWorlds. If you choose the first method<br>
and you have no existing routines to create off-screen drawing environments, it's<br>
worth it to take a look at Skippy White's Famous High-Level Off-Screen Map Routines<br>
in DTS Sample Code #15 on the<i>Developer CD Series</i> disc. You can see these routines in<br>
action in DTS Sample Code #16. These routines are GWorld-like to some extent,<br>
except this time you have the great benefit of source code!
