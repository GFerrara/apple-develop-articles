<h2>MACINTOSH Q &amp; A</h2>
<h1>MACINTOSH DEVLOPER TECHNICAL SUPPORT</h1>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Why would using OpenResFile(fileName) cause a crash when I try to open a</i><br>
<i>Macintosh font file that's already open?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> The problem stems from the fact that OpenResFile doesn't deal effectively with cases<br>
where the resource file is already open. Luckily, there are some relatively new<br>
Resource Manager calls that you can and should use instead. They're all documented in<br>
the Resource Manager chapter of<i> Inside Macintosh </i> Volume VI and in Macintosh<br>
Technical Note #214, New Resource Manager Calls.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The call of interest in your case is HOpenResFile. To use it, break down the vRefNum<br>
(actually WDRefNum) returned by Standard File into a real vRefNum and dirID by<br>
calling PBGetWDInfo, and pass those to HOpenResFile along with the file name. The<br>
important part, however, is the permissions byte. If you expect to modify the file,<br>
pass fsRdWrPerm in that field. If there's an error of any kind, expect HOpenResFile to<br>
return -1, which should serve as a signal that you need to call ResError to find out<br>
what went wrong.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> My application, which has several units and objects, compiles under MPW 3.1 but</i><br>
<i>not under MPW 3.2. Do forward references to objects work differently with MPW</i><br>
<i>3.2?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> MPW 3.2 has a new syntax for forward references to objects. Objects must be<br>
declared as externals, as follows:
</p>
<pre>TYPE
    TObjB = OBJECT; external; { MPW 3.2 requires this }
    TObjA = OBJECT(TObject)
        fFwdRef: TObjB;

        {methods}
END;</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;Note that by default the Pascal compiler includes information such as USES in its<br>
symbol table resources, so simply using the correct USES and external declarations<br>
may not be sufficient; you may find it necessary to invoke the Pascal compiler with the<br>
-rebuild option to force it to reconstruct its symbol table resources from scratch.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> With the System 7.0 version of the LaserWriter driver, when the user selects</i><br>
<i>Envelope from the Page Setup dialog, the page size returned by the driver is still a</i><br>
<i>standard page: 8.5 x 11. How do you recommend that applications display the page size</i><br>
<i>when the user has chosen a nonstandard page size?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> We recommend that you have the page preview show a full page instead of an<br>
envelope-sized page. The LaserWriter&#174; driver supports a large number of PostScript<br>
&#174; devices, and it can't be sure whether the envelope will be fed on the right, left, or<br>
center of the paper tray. If you show the full page, a user can print on any device by<br>
putting the text in the correct location for that device.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Manufacturers of PostScript printers can add custom page sizes to the LaserWriter<br>
driver. If they do, the representation on the screen will be whatever they decide to<br>
define. Applications should not try to interpret custom page sizes. If your application<br>
ignores the results returned by the driver, you risk incompatibility down the road.<b>Q</b><br>
<i>Why is my Macintosh driver receiving a&nbsp;&nbsp;positive drive number under System 7.0</i><br>
<i>upon notification of an _Eject call?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> When the "driver wants a call on eject" bit is set in the flag bytes preceding a drive<br>
queue element, _Eject will issue a _Control call with a csCode of 7 to the driver. This<br>
_Control call is supposed to inform the driver which disk the OS is attempting to eject,<br>
by passing the drive number in the ioVRefNum field of the parameter block.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;However, there's a bug in the ROM that only manifests itself when _Eject is given a<br>
volume reference number for a disk that has both the "nonejectable" and "driver wants<br>
a call on eject" bits set in the drive flag bytes. This bug causes the driver to receive<br>
the negative of the drive number, rather than the positive drive number.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The System 7.0 Finder has reversed the order of its calls to _UnmountVol and _Eject,<br>
causing it to pass the drive number to _Eject, which then passes it on to the driver<br>
correctly. Unfortunately, under previous systems, the Finder passed the volume<br>
reference number to _Eject, forcing developers to work around the bug by accepting<br>
negative drive numbers; however, a problem could occur now under System 7.0 if<br>
positive drive numbers weren't accepted as well.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;A number of driver writers have notified us of this problem, but few (so far) have<br>
been adversely affected. As it has always been possible for utilities or applications to<br>
make _Eject calls with either a volume reference number or a drive number, the<br>
proper workaround is to handle both positive and negative drive numbers.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> How many active ranges can a Macintosh application have on a shared file? If the</i><br>
<i>answer is more than one, is the limit per application or per machine? If two ranges</i><br>
<i>overlap, are they joined into one range? Can an application nest ranges? For example,</i><br>
<i>if an application's user performs an action that forces a record to be locked and later</i><br>
<i>the application locks the full range of the file, does the initial record lock disappear?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> The only way to determine the limit is to hit the limit and get a NoMoreLocks error.<br>
The number of range locks supported is a limit of the server platform, and that limit<br>
is shared by all users of the server (at least it is with Apple's AppleShare &#174; server<br>
software). With Apple's server- based version of AppleShare, approximately 40 locks<br>
per user are allowed (for example, if the server allows 25 users, there are 1000<br>
locked ranges total; if the server allows 50 users, there are 2000 locked ranges total;<br>
and with File Sharing running under System 7.0, approximately 20 locks are allowed<br>
per user). Other vendors may allow more or fewer locked ranges on their<br>
implementations of an AppleTalk &#174; Filing Protocol (AFP) server. Notice that the<br>
numbers given are per user, not per application. It's assumed that a user probably<br>
won't need more than a few locks at a time on a single file.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;You cannot have range locks that overlap. You'll get a RangeOverlap error from AFP.<br>
All the rules for range locking can be found in the AFP chapter of <i> Inside AppleTalk</i> <br>
(page 13-56). Additional information on AppleShare limits is available in the Dev<br>
Tech Answers library on AppleLink and on the <i>Developer Essentials</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;disc.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The February 1991 revision of Macintosh Technical Note #186 covers several<br>
important details about PBLockRange and PBUnlockRange that are not in <i> Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i> .
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Where can we get our hands on a fix to the ROM bug in the Macintosh IIci and</i><br>
<i>Macintosh IIfx Memory Manager? Word has it that Apple wrote an INIT (MMInit) to</i><br>
<i>fix this problem. Because we're using our application on both the Macintosh IIci and</i><br>
<i>the IIfx, and the application uses many handles, this fix would be appreciated.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Under System 6.0.x, Apple had identified a minor problem with the Memory<br>
Manager in the Macintosh IIfx, IIci, IIsi, and LC. This problem resulted in a<br>
performance degradation&nbsp;&nbsp;in an extremely small number of applications and did not<br>
cause system crashes. We believe this was an insignificant problem that affected few<br>
applications and very few customers. The problem was not new and was not caused by<br>
the introduction of System Software 6.0.5 or 6.0.7.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Based on developer feedback, customer feedback, and extensive in-house testing,<br>
Apple has identified very few affected applications. Because the problem affects only an<br>
extremely small number of developers, Apple is working with those developers to fix<br>
their applications. The best solution, however, is to upgrade to System 7.0, as it<br>
includes an enhancement to the Memory Manager to address this issue.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;During extensive testing and research, Apple investigated a variety of solutions to<br>
enhance the Memory Manager performance. One area researched was a software<br>
solution called the Memory Manager INIT (a software "patch"), or MMInit as it's most<br>
often called. Through testing we discovered that this patch did not enhance Memory<br>
Manager performance and introduced risks such as decreased performance in some<br>
mainstream applications.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;An unofficial version of the Memory Manager INIT has surfaced. This INIT should not<br>
be used, because it has been modified from Apple's experimental version and could<br>
cause data corruption, data loss, and crashes. Apple strongly urges that you discard the<br>
INIT if you have obtained a copy, and not use it. If any version of this INIT is used<br>
under System 7.0, it defeats the enhanced Memory Manager and reintroduces the bugs<br>
that were present in the System 6.0.x Memory Manager.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;You may still wonder if you have been affected by this problem and how to avoid it<br>
under 6.0.x. The problem is most severe when allocating pointers in a heap with a<br>
rather large number of handles (on the order of tens of thousands). It's helpful to<br>
allocate enough master pointers (via MoreMasters) during initialization. If the<br>
Memory Manager has to call MoreMasters later on, not only could it fragment<br>
memory, but it could take an exceedingly long time. It's also helpful not to allocate<br>
thousands of handles. Besides requiring lots of master pointers, it takes the Memory<br>
Manager a long time to crunch through them during heap compaction.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Does setting the is32BitCompatible bit in the 'SIZE' resource have any effect in</i><br>
<i>System 7.0?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> The alert box that was to be shown for applications with the 'SIZE' resource's<br>
is32BitCompatible flag disabled was found to be too confusing for an end user, so the<br>
is32BitCompatible flag is not used and the alert box is not displayed in the final<br>
System 7.0. (It is, however, displayed in A/UX 2.0 and 2.0.1.) This could change in<br>
the future.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Can you describe a procedure for extracting TrueType character outline data directly</i><br>
<i>from the Macintosh system software?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Future releases of Macintosh system software probably will include calls for<br>
accessing TrueType character outline data. In the meantime, sample code showing how<br>
to parse the 'sfnt' outline font resource is available on the <i> Developer Essentials </i> disc<br>
and on AppleLink in the Developer Support: Developer Services:Developer Technical<br>
Support:Developer Essentials:Sample Code folder.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Where can I find information on manipulating TrueType fonts under System 6.0.7?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> The System 6.0.7 TrueType INIT includes all the outline calls in System 7.0, so<br>
everything you need is in <i> Inside Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume VI. Use Gestalt's<br>
gestaltFontMgrAttr selector (described in the "Compatibility Guidelines" chapter of<br>
Volume VI, and available in System 6.0.4 and later) to determine whether TrueType is<br>
available on the machine in question, and then use outline calls freely and with<br>
abandon. The latest MPW release has the header files, called OutlineCalls. Use version<br>
4.1 of Font/DA Mover to move outline fonts under System 6.0.7. Both the TrueType<br>
INIT and Font/DA Mover 4.1 are available on AppleLink and on the<i> Developer</i><br>
<i>Essentials </i> disc,&nbsp;&nbsp;and you can license Font/DA Mover to include it with your product<br>
release by contacting Apple's Software Licensing group.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Why doesn't the StyleWriter</i> &#174;<i> like&nbsp;&nbsp;the SetLineWidth PicComment (182)? It</i><br>
<i>prints the line at a 1-point weight.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Most of Apple's QuickDraw printers do not support the SetLineWidth PicComment.<br>
Because there's no feedback as to whether the PicComment was successful, use of the<br>
comment is problematic. It's not regularly handled, except in PostScript printers.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The best way to make full use of a Macintosh printer's resolution is through the<br>
PrGeneral trap. You'll find it thoroughly described in the article "Meet PrGeneral, the<br>
Trap That Makes the Most of the Printing Manager" in Issue 3 of <i> develop</i> , and also<br>
covered in <i> Inside Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume V. PicComments are discussed in Macintosh<br>
Technical Notes #91 and #175.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> How can a Macintosh in 24-bit addressing mode read from disk into a GWorld? If the</i><br>
<i>GC card is installed, sometimes the GWorld is a 32-bit one cached on the card. How do</i><br>
<i>we ensure the GWorld will be in main memory?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> When you create your GWorld, set the keepLocal flag in the flags field of the<br>
NewGWorld call. This ensures that the newly created GWorld will be in main memory<br>
where you can access it. Read your data into the GWorld and then clear the keepLocal<br>
flag with a call to SetPixelState. This will issue a "GWorld has been updated" type of<br>
message, causing the GWorld to be cached off to the GC card, giving you the best<br>
performance. When you want to load another image, call SetPixelState again, setting<br>
the keepLocal flag to bring the GWorld back to main memory. Using this technique<br>
you'll be able to load your GWorld and cache it too, and you won't need to recreate the<br>
GWorld each time you want to load more data into it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> What are the effects of InitCM, InitCRM, InitCRMUtilities, and similar calls to the</i><br>
<i>Macintosh Communications Tools by nonapplications such as INITs or background</i><br>
<i>processes? What effect do multiple INIT calls have on Communications Tools</i><br>
<i>operations and any existing connections? What do these calls do, and when (and how</i><br>
<i>many times) is it safe to call them?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> All these initialization calls deal with the process of loading the 'cmtb' resource into<br>
the system heap, putting entries into the Communications Toolbox (CTB) dispatch<br>
table with references to the current heap zone, and setting up various things having to<br>
do with resource management for the operation of the CTB. You can call them over and<br>
over again without damaging existing information.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;With this new perspective, you can see that a synergy exists between operations of the<br>
CTB and the Resource Manager. The CTB needs to be in the appropriate heap zone when<br>
a ConnHandle is generated or referenced for it to operate as desired. If you're writing a<br>
background process that maintains its own persistent heap zone, you shouldn't have<br>
any difficulties using the CTB.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;If you're writing an INIT, matters are more complex. You must SetZone(SystemZone)<br>
while performing all CTB operations (including initialization, CMGetProcID, and<br>
CMNew) to be sure the heap zone will persist after the INIT has completed. Possibly<br>
the reason for doing this at INIT time is to create ConnHandles that will persist for CTB<br>
access at a later time. It seems reasonable that ConnHandles thus created require a<br>
SetZone(SystemZone) by any routine that needs to access them for<br>
Read/Write/Status/Delete operations.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> Is there some kind of bug with the Macintosh Balloon Help feature in System 7.0? It</i><br>
<i>goes into the application and uses the text from the 'STR#' resource ID 4001 instead of</i><br>
<i>the 'STR#' resource ID 4001 of Finder Help.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> The System 7.0 Help Manager stores its balloon strings in the Finder TM Help<br>
resource file. Under certain circumstances, the Help Manager will access the string<br>
resources in your application before it accesses the resources of the Finder Help file.<br>
Consequently, problems will occur if your application contains certain 'STR#' and<br>
'STR ' resources. There are only&nbsp;&nbsp;two circumstances in which your application may be<br>
affected. First, if your application uses a 'STR#' resource with ID 4001, the Help<br>
Manager will use the first string resource of the list instead of the corresponding<br>
resource in Finder Help. When the pointer is placed over your application icon's text<br>
on the desktop, the default text, "Change the icon's name by clicking on the name and<br>
typing," will be changed to the text stored in 'STR#' 4001 of your application.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Second, if your application has a 'STR ' resource with ID 17251, the Help Manager<br>
will use that string resource instead of the corresponding string resource in Finder<br>
Help. The default text, "This is an application--a program with which you . . . " will<br>
be changed to the text stored in 'STR ' 17251 of your application.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;To avoid these problems, you have a few options. You can create your own 'hfdr'<br>
resource to override 'STR ' 17251, or you can avoid using 'STR ' 17251 and 'STR#'<br>
4001. If you must use 'STR#' 4001, paste the text "Change the icon's name by<br>
clicking on the name and typing" into the first string and use the rest of the strings for<br>
your application's use.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> How can I determine the intrinsic styles supported by a particular PostScript font?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> To find the styles that are supported by a particular font, you need to access one of<br>
two tables. To find the screen fonts that are available, you can use the font association<br>
table, shown on page 38 of <i>Inside Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume IV. Each entry in the table<br>
contains the size and style of the font, as well as the resource ID. Each font in this table<br>
should be available for the screen.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;When you print a font to a PostScript printer, the Font Manager uses the<br>
style-naming table in the family record to create a PostScript name for the font. The<br>
table has a list of strings, followed by an entry for each style supported by that<br>
particular font. A table for Times might look like this:
</p>
<p><table border="0"><tr><td><b>Value</b></td><td><b></b><b>Description</b></td><td><b></b><b>Hex Dump</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Number of Strings &lt;INTEGER&gt;</td><td>09</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Times"</td><td>Basename of font</td><td>05, 54, 69, 6D, 65, 73</td></tr>
<tr><td>6, 7</td><td>Suffix index for style 1</td><td>02, 06, 07</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><i>Pascal String that looks like:</i></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><code>String[0] := CHR(2);</code></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><code>String[1] := CHR(6);</code></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><code>String[2] := CHR(7);</code></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>6,8</td><td>Suffix index for style 2</td><td>02, 06, 08</td></tr>
<tr><td>6,9</td><td>Suffix index for style 3</td><td>02, 06, 09</td></tr>
<tr><td>6,8, 9</td><td>Suffix index for style 4</td><td>03, 06, 08, 09</td></tr>
<tr><td>"-"</td><td>Suffix 1</td><td>01, 2D</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Roman"</td><td>Suffix 2</td><td>05, 52, 6F, 6D, 61, 6E</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Bold"</td><td>Suffix 3</td><td>04, 42, 6F, 6C, 64</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Italic"</td><td>Suffix 4</td><td>06, 49, 74, 61, 6C, 69, 63</td></tr></table></p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Except for the first entry, all entries in the table are stored as Pascal strings with a<br>
length byte followed by one byte for each character in the string.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The table is used to build the PostScript font name for a particular style. This is a<br>
little complicated, so hang on. Let's look at the table again, with each line numbered,<br>
and without all the hex:
</p>
<p>
0: 9<br>
1: "Times"<br>
2: 6, 7<br>
3: 6, 8<br>
4: 6, 9<br>
5: 6, 8, 9 6: "-"<br>
7: "Roman"<br>
8: "Bold"<br>
9: "Italic"
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Entry #0 is the number of strings in this table. Entry #1 is the basename of the font.<br>
Entries #6- 9 are the suffixes that will be appended to the basename for particular<br>
styles. Entries #2-5 are the indexes of the suffixes required to create the PostScript<br>
names for the different styles (entry 2 = plain, 3 = bold, 4 = italic, and 5=<br>
bold+italic).
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Let's use entry #2 to build a name: 1. Always start with the basename: "Times" 2.<br>
Append the first suffix, #6 in this case: "Times-" 3. Append the second and last suffix,<br>
#7: "Times-Roman"
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The style-naming table is not documented in the Font Manager chapter of <i> Inside</i><br>
<i>Macintosh</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;because it's too specific to PostScript. Instead, it's documented in the <br>
<i>LaserWriter Reference</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Addison-Wesley) on pages 28-35. The manual's description<br>
doesn't include examples, so the above example makes things easier to understand.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> What is the easiest way to reset a Macintosh color map or palette to the default</i><br>
<i>system color map?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Use RestoreDeviceClut(gd:GDHandle). You pass the handle to the device in question,<br>
or nil if you want all devices reset. The call is described in the Palette Manager<br>
chapter of<i>Inside Macintosh</i> Volume VI. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Q</b><i> If System 7.0 were the Seven Dwarfs, which dwarf would Virtual Memory be?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A</b> Sneezy.
