<h2>SCORING POINTS WITH TRUETYPE</h2>
<h1>KONSTANTIN OTHMER AND MIKE REED</h1>
<p>
<i>TrueType, Apple's outline font technology, opens up a world of possibilities for</i><br>
<i>improved handling of text. For example, with outline fonts, users can resize text as</i><br>
<i>they've always been able to resize other objects in drawing programs--by grabbing</i><br>
<i>handles and dragging. This article shows how to program this and other exciting</i><br>
<i>transformations to text. </i>
</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The Font Manager in System 7.0 can use TrueType outline fonts, in addition to<br>
bitmapped fonts, to produce text on the screen and on a printer. In outline fonts, the<br>
appearance of individual characters is defined by outlines, not bitmaps. The TrueType<br>
font mechanism is also available as an INIT for System 6.0.7 users.
</p>
<p>
Your application can take advantage of the special capabilities provided by TrueType<br>
fonts to transform text in decorative and useful ways. These transformations include<br>
shrinking or stretching text to fit a given bounding box and creating patterned,<br>
antialiased text. This article provides routines for accomplishing both of these kinds of<br>
transformations. First, though, let's explore in more detail how TrueType fonts differ<br>
from their predecessor, bitmapped fonts. 
</p>
<h2>WHY TRUETYPE IS TRULY WONDERFUL</h2>
<p>
To understand why TrueType is truly wonderful, you first have to understand the<br>
trouble with bitmapped fonts. With bitmapped fonts, to generate fonts of sizes for<br>
which no bitmap exists, QuickDraw simply picks an available font size according to a<br>
gnarly algorithm and stretches or shrinks the bits. Unfortunately, when a bitmap is<br>
resized the resulting image is often far from pleasing.
</p>
<p>
This problem is easily understood: imagine you're shrinking a 1-bit image by a factor<br>
of two in the vertical dimension. This means two pixels in the source image combine to<br>
form one pixel in the result. If both source pixels are black or both are white, the<br>
solution is easy. The problem comes when the two source pixels are different. In this<br>
case, since most images on the Macintosh appear on a white background, QuickDraw<br>
preserves black. Thus, if either source pixel is black, the result is black. 
</p>
<p>
QuickDraw uses this same algorithm for larger shrinks. When an image is shrunk<br>
vertically by a factor of eight, if any one of the eight source pixels is black, the<br>
resulting pixel is black. Because there is more information in the source than can be<br>
represented in the destination, the resulting image often looks ragged and is typically<br>
too dark. 
</p>
<p>
A similar problem is encountered when enlarging an image. QuickDraw enlarges<br>
images by replicating pixels; thus, the result becomes blocky. There simply is not<br>
enough information in the&nbsp;&nbsp;source image to provide a better scaled-up representation.<br>
Figure 1 shows a 72-point B in the bitmapped Times&#174; font resized by various<br>
amounts.

</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 1</b> Resizing a Bitmapped Character
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;This problem with resizing has further implications. Have you ever tried to resize<br>
text in the same way you resize other objects in a drawing program like MacDraw&#174;?<br>
If you have, you've discovered that when you move the handles on the bounding box, the<br>
text clipping and formatting change, but the text isn't resized. This inconsistency<br>
between the way text and other objects are handled can be very confusing to users and<br>
may deny them the function they really want: to stretch the text to fill the box. The<br>
reason for this difficulty is--you guessed it! Although resizing an object such as a<br>
rectangle produces excellent results, resizing a bitmapped font results in an image<br>
that is, well, ugly. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Enter TrueType. With TrueType fonts, each character is stored as an outline.<br>
QuickDraw knows the shape of the character, much as it knows the shape of a circle.<br>
When a character is imaged, its outline is scaled to the appropriate size and then filled.<br>
When a character is scaled, the outline is scaled rather than the bits. Thus, an<br>
excellent representation of the character is possible at all scaling factors. Figure 2<br>
shows how an outline font looks when compared to a bitmapped font drawn in a size for<br>
which no bitmap exists.

</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;Figure 2</b> Bitmapped Versus Outline Font
</p>
<p>
Because characters maintain their integrity at all sizes in TrueType, it's now possible<br>
to resize text in the same way users have always been able to resize other objects in<br>
drawing programs. We'll show you a routine for doing this. It's also possible to<br>
superimpose a text mask on any picture you want in order to create decorative effects.<br>
We'll also show you how to do this. 
</p>
<h2>&nbsp;SCALING TEXT TO FIT A GIVEN RECTANGLE</h2>
<p>
To show how easy it is with TrueType to produce high-quality text scaled to given<br>
dimensions, we've written a routine called BoxText that scales a string of text to fit a<br>
given rectangle. It takes a parameter that indicates how the text should be constrained:<br>
vertically, horizontally, both, or neither.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 3 shows examples of text treated in<br>
these ways with the BoxText routine. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The BoxText routine is fairly simple. It first checks to see if any constraints are<br>
turned on. The constraints are defined as follows:
</p>
<pre>typedef enum boxTextOptions {
    noConstraints,
    constrainH,
    constrainV
} boxTextOptions;</pre>
<p>
&nbsp;Normally, BoxText works just like DrawString. If you pass constraints, the text is<br>
stretched to fit the bounding rectangle's width, or height, or both. This is done through<br>
a call to StdText. The stretching factors are computed from the text's original bounds<br>
and the bounds passed to BoxText. 
</p>
<p>

<pre>void GetTextRect(char* text, Rect* bounds)
{
    Point       identity;
    SetPt(&amp;identity, 1, 1);     /* No scaling. */
    GetTextBounds(text, identity, identity, bounds);
}
void GetTextBounds(char* text, Point numer, Point denom,
        Rect* bounds)
{
    FontInfo    info;
    Fixed       hScale = FixDiv(numer.h, denom.h);
    Fixed       vScale = FixDiv(numer.v, denom.v);

    GetFontInfo(&amp;info);
    SetRect( bounds, 0, FixMul(-info.ascent, vScale),
                FixMul(StringWidth(text), hScale),
                FixMul(info.descent + info.leading, vScale) );
    OffsetRect(bounds, thePort-&gt;pnLoc.h, thePort-&gt;pnLoc.v);
}</pre>
<p>
GetTextRect calls GetTextBounds. GetTextBounds takes a string and scaling factors and<br>
returns the bounding rectangle; note that it calls GetFontInfo to determine the height<br>
and StringWidth to determine the width. GetFontInfo is used instead of OutlineMetrics<br>
since the measurements for the entire font (not just individual characters) are used to<br>
calculate the rectangle for the text.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, GetFontInfo is faster than<br>
OutlineMetrics. 
</p>
<p>
The bounds are then scaled by the given scaling factors. The ascent is scaled by the<br>
vertical stretching factor to correctly place the text's baseline. Without this<br>
adjustment, the top of the text would not align with the top of the constraining<br>
rectangle. Finally, the rectangle is offset to the current pen location. 
</p>
<p>
When the text is constrained to fit in the rectangle both horizontally and vertically,<br>
the numerator for vertical scaling is set to the height of the rectangle and the<br>
denominator is set to the height of the text. For horizontal scaling, the numerator is<br>
set to the rectangle width and the denominator is set to the string width. Traditionally,<br>
these scaling factors have been stored in point records, and in our routine the code<br>
uses SetPt to set the values. Then MoveTo is called to position the pen at the location<br>
where the text is to be drawn. Finally, the scaled text is drawn using StdText and the<br>
text size is restored. 
</p>
<p>
Note the technique used to call StdText: First the code checks to see whether there are<br>
custom bottlenecks in the current port (as there are when printing). If so (the<br>
grafProcs field is nonzero), the StdText bottleneck routine, rather than the trap, is<br>
called. This is necessary to allow BoxText to print. (Calling the StdText bottleneck is<br>
accomplished via the macro, given for both MPW and THINK C, before the BoxText<br>
routine.)

<h2>RESIZING TEXT INTERACTIVELY</h2>
<p>
In most drawing programs, you change the size of an object by clicking and dragging<br>
with the mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of interactive resizing is called<i>rubberbanding</i> since the<br>
borders of the object stretch and shrink like a rubber band. Using the previously<br>
described BoxText routine, it's easy to achieve this result for text.
</p>
<p>
The following routine, SlowRubberBandText, performs the operation. As you can<br>
probably guess from the routine name, the performance is not optimal. We'll return to<br>
this issue later with the FastRubberBandText routine. 
</p>
<p>
The first thing SlowRubberBandText does is to set the pen mode and text mode to Xor.<br>
Xor mode is used so that drawing and erasing can be accomplished without buffering the<br>
screen contents and thus without using much memory. The drawback is that the text<br>
flickers when it's being resized. A commercial application would check to see if enough<br>
memory is available to buffer the screen contents, and if so would provide<br>
flicker-free resizing. 
</p>
<p>
Next we have a do-while loop that tracks the mouse as long as the button is held down.<br>
On each iteration through the loop, a rectangle is constructed from the anchor point<br>
and the current mouse position. This rectangle is drawn and then BoxText is called to<br>
draw the text scaled to the rectangle. 
</p>
<p>
The do-while loop waits for the mouse to move or for the button to be let up. If either<br>
of these conditions occurs, the text is erased (by being drawn again in the same place).<br>
If the button is let up (the terminating condition on the do-while loop), the routine<br>
exits, returning the bounding rectangle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, the text is drawn scaled, using<br>
the new mouse position. 
</p>
<pre>void SlowRubberBandText(char* myPString, Point anchorPoint,
        Rect *theRect, boxTextOptions options)
{
    Point       oldPoint;
    Point       newPoint;

    PenMode(patXor);
    TextMode(srcXor);
    SetRect(theRect, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    do {
        GetMouse(&amp;oldPoint);
        Pt2Rect(oldPoint, anchorPoint, theRect);
        FrameRect(theRect);                     /* Draw it. */
        BoxText(myPString, theRect, options);
        newPoint = oldPoint;
        while (EqualPt(newPoint, oldPoint) &amp;&amp; Button())
            GetMouse(&amp;newPoint);
        FrameRect(theRect);                     /* Erase it. */
        BoxText(myPString, theRect, options);
    } while (Button());
}</pre>
<p>
While this routine is a simple illustration of the use of BoxText, it's excruciatingly<br>
slow. The reason is that QuickDraw must rerender the outline every time the scaling<br>
changes. The FastRubberBandText routine images the text into a 1-bit off-screen<br>
GWorld, and then uses CopyBits to stretch the resulting bitmap to fit the specified<br>
rectangle. This is similar to the method QuickDraw uses to scale bitmapped fonts,<br>
described previously, and is much faster than the slow case.
</p>
<p>
The code first allocates a sufficiently large bitmap so that the text looks good even at<br>
large sizes. If the allocation fails in both temporary memory and the application heap,<br>
the code tries smaller rectangles in both heaps. If this also fails, it calls the<br>
SlowRubberBandText routine. If the needed memory is available, GWorld gyrations are<br>
performed to image the text into the off-screen pixMap.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a do-while loop similar<br>
to the one in the SlowRubberBandText routine is executed, but rather than calling<br>
BoxText, it calls CopyBits. The exit conditions are similar to SlowRubberBandText,<br>
with the addition that the GWorld is disposed of.

<h2>&nbsp;CREATING PATTERNED, ANTIALIASED TEXT</h2>
<p>
Generation of high-quality scaled text is only one of the fun tricks of the new outline<br>
fonts in System 7.0. You can also create patterned, antialiased text with just a few<br>
lines of code. (Antialiased text is text whose edges have been smoothed by the addition<br>
of gray, creating a softer effect; see Figure 4, and see the antialiased version in color<br>
on the inside front cover of this issue.) The possibilities this opens up for writing a<br>
"Hello, World" program are staggering, as illustrated in Figure 5. 
</p>
<p>

</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 5</b> How "Hello, World" Looks in 1991
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;To achieve this result you use the CopyDeepMask call (available only in System 7.0).<br>
Your application generates a source pixMap with the pattern or picture you want to<br>
use; the CreateTextMask routine creates a GWorld containing the text mask; and<br>
finally, you call CopyDeepMask to image the source through the mask onto the<br>
destination. Figure 6 illustrates this. 
</p>
<p>
<b>&nbsp;GENERATING THE MASK</b><br>
The CreateTextMask routine works as follows: First, we attempt to allocate a GWorld<br>
that would allow text to be rendered at four times its final size. (If there's not enough<br>
memory in the application heap or temporary memory to allocate a GWorld this big,<br>
GWorlds of three times and then two times the final size are created. If all of these<br>
attempts fail, nil is returned.) Next the 1-bit GWorld is cleared to white and the text<br>
is imaged into it scaled by a factor of four (or whatever multiple the 1- bit GWorld<br>
turned out to be) in each direction. Then CopyBits with mode ditherCopy is used to<br>
shrink the large 1-bit GWorld to a 4-bit gray-scale GWorld; this is illustrated in<br>
Figure 7. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Because the mask will consist only of grays, the 4-bit GWorld is given a gray-scale<br>
CLUT. We are now finished with the 1-bit GWorld and dispose of it. The 4-bit<br>
gray-scale image we just created is returned by CreateTextMask. Notice that this<br>
routine may return a GWorld allocated in temporary memory, so you must dispose of<br>
the GWorld before calling WaitNextEvent.

<b>SAYING "HELLO, WORLD"</b><br>
Now we're ready to say "Hello, World" in patterned, antialiased text as shown in<br>
Figure 4. The following routine combines the BoxText, FastRubberBandText, and<br>
CreateTextMask routines to produce its results. In this example, the source pixMap<br>
contains a picture that's read in from a resource file. This pixMap could, of course,<br>
contain anything, and that image would peek through the text mask. The interesting<br>
thing to notice is that if you scale the source picture to the size of the text, the image<br>
behind each letter will stay the same regardless of the scaling factor.

<h2>SUMMARY AND PARTING THOUGHTS</h2>
<p>
TrueType fonts provide high-quality characters at all sizes and scaling factors. This is<br>
possible because TrueType fonts are stored as outlines rather than bitmaps, and<br>
scaling an outline produces much better results than scaling a bitmap. The BoxText<br>
routine described in this article uses the StdText call to stretch text to fit within a<br>
specified box. A logical extension of this could solve a problem that has plagued<br>
humankind (or at least high school students): how to expand six and a half pages of text<br>
to produce a report that's exactly ten pages long, as required by law or a high school<br>
teacher.
</p>
<p>
Usually tactics such as adjusting the margins, line spacing, and font size can get you<br>
close. But this trial-and-error process could easily be replaced with a procedure<br>
written by some enterprising and humanitarian programmer:
</p>
<pre>FitTextToPages(char *text, long numPages);</pre>
<p>
Rather than simply adjusting the margins and line spacing, this routine could<br>
uniformly stretch a block of text to fill the desired number of pages. 
</p>
<p>
System 7.0 also allows applications to pass a deep mask to CopyMask or<br>
CopyDeepMask. By imaging text into a large bitmap and then scaling it down with<br>
ditherCopy, it's possible to generate a soft- edged mask for producing antialiased text.<br>
Furthermore, text drawn using CopyDeepMask can have any image as the source<br>
pixMap, making it easy to produce patterned or picture text. 
</p>
<p>
In the process of producing all of these great effects with text, we used GWorlds<br>
extensively. From the code samples it should be clear that GWorlds are extremely<br>
simple to create and manipulate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judicious use of temporary memory for holding<br>
GWorlds allows our sample "Hello, World" program to run in a 100K heap and still<br>
produce very large (bigger than 1200 x 500 pixels) scaled text (provided there's<br>
enough temporary memory available, of course). 
</p>
<p>
Enjoy!

<b>The antialiasing technique</b> used in this article requires a<br>
multiple-bits-per-pixel destination device. Since most printers are 1 bit per pixel,<br>
these antialiasing techniques are useful primarily for the screen. A second problem<br>
with printing antialiased text using these techniques is that QuickDraw does not pass<br>
the CopyDeepMask call to printer drivers. For multiple-bits-per- pixel printers,<br>
you could image the antialiased text into a GWorld and then use CopyBits to draw the<br>
image on a printer. *
