<p>
Dear Readers,
</p>
<p>
Have you ever searched and searched for the answers to your questions only to find that<br>
they were right there under your nose the whole time? That's happened a lot with<br>
develop. We've made several changes in the one short year that we've been around:<br>
we've started printing the code dark enough so that you can read it, we're printing on<br>
recycled paper (see the letters section), we've added two columns, and we've trashed<br>
themes. The first two changes were direct results of your comments and our research<br>
(you see, we really do want to hear what you have to say), the other two were things<br>
I'm sure you thought of, but never got around to writing about.
</p>
<p>
The columns should help reduce the commitment that reading develop has become--we<br>
hope they'll provide you with some food for thought and with some time left over to<br>
ruminate.
</p>
<p>
And the themes, well, they just weren't working. Since the articles were only loosely<br>
grouped around a theme, you didn't get enough information to decide whether to read an<br>
issue or to pass it along (I most sincerely hope you'd never consider trashing it); it<br>
also forced us to defer some articles until there was a theme or an issue they fit in. So<br>
without themes, we'll let you decide how to categorize them (and still look forward to<br>
your article suggestions and ideas), and we'll concentrate on filling each issue with<br>
thorough, helpful, and interesting articles.
</p>
<p>
We're a nosey bunch and we want to know what you're thinking and what you're hoping.<br>
(Don't consider this a threat, but if we don't get more feedback, we'll have to do a<br>
survey to figure out what you want.)
</p>
<p>
So, nose around the articles and the code and pick out what interests you. Then let us<br>
know what intrigued you and what baffled you (we strive to intrigue, not baffle).
</p>
